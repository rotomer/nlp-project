Credit Agreement and Related Agreements
On November 14, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. ("Eagle Test") described below in Item 2.01, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among Teradyne, as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Agent"), RBS Citizens, N.A., as Syndication Agent, KeyBank National Association, as Documentation Agent, Silicon Valley Bank and Toronto Dominion (New York) LLC (the "Lenders") and certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of Teradyne from time to time (the "Guarantors"). The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of $122.5 million. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement, together with cash on hand, will be used to finance the acquisition of Eagle Test, and for working capital needs and general corporate purposes. On November 14, 2008, Teradyne borrowed $100 million available under the credit facility.
At Teradyne's option, loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin which will vary between 3.00% and 3.50% based on Teradyne's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin which will vary between 2.00% and 2.50% based on Teradyne's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. In addition, Teradyne is required to pay the Lenders a commitment fee at a rate per annum of 0.75% on the actual daily unused amount of the credit facility commitments of such Lenders during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears.
The credit facility will be available on a revolving basis until November 14, 2011. Teradyne may optionally prepay loans or reduce the credit facility commitments at any time, without penalty. The revolving credit facility terminates if at any time the credit facility commitments have been permanently reduced to zero and all outstanding obligations have been repaid.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. Affirmative covenants include, among others, with respect to Teradyne and its subsidiaries, maintenance of existence, financial and other reporting, payment of obligations, maintenance of properties and insurance, and an agreement to cause future material domestic subsidiaries to become parties to the Security and Pledge Agreement referred to below. Negative covenants include, among others, with respect to Teradyne and its subsidiaries, limitations on incurrence or guarantees of indebtedness, limitations on liens, sale and lease-back transactions, investments, dividends, share redemptions and other restricted payments, affiliate transactions and capital expenditures. The Credit Agreement also requires Teradyne to maintain certain financial ratios as of the end of any fiscal quarter, including a leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and an available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio.
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, among others, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect, non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts, violation of covenants, cross-defaults with other material indebtedness, certain undischarged judgments, the occurrence of certain ERISA or insolvency events and the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Upon an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders may declare the loans and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. A bankruptcy or insolvency event of default causes such obligations automatically to become immediately due and payable.
The obligations of Teradyne under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of Teradyne. As of the closing date, the only Guarantor is Nextest Systems Corporation. Pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement, dated November 14, 2008 (the "Security and Pledge Agreement"), among Teradyne, the Guarantors and the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, the loans and the other obligations of Teradyne and the Guarantors are secured by (i) all personal property of Teradyne and each Guarantor, (ii) all present and future shares of capital stock of (or other ownership or profit interests in) each of Teradyne's present and future subsidiaries (limited to 65% of the capital stock of each first-tier foreign subsidiary) and (iii) all real property of Teradyne and each Guarantor, if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.5 to 10.
The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreement and the Security and Pledge Agreement do not purport to be complete statements of the parties' rights under such agreements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement and the Security and Pledge Agreement, respectively.
 
On November 14, 2008, Teradyne, Inc. ("Teradyne") completed its acquisition of Eagle Test Systems, Inc. ("Eagle Test") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of September 1, 2008, among Teradyne, Eagle Test and Turin Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Teradyne ("Merger Sub"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Eagle Test, with Eagle Test continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Teradyne.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Eagle Test common stock converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $15.65 per share in cash, without interest, on November 14, 2008.
The aggregate purchase price paid by Teradyne for this acquisition was approximately $250 million, net of cash acquired and including the estimated fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments and estimated transaction costs.

that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States,
(A) any Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
(B) each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
(I) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,

(V) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(iii) Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
(f) . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
provided
 
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans or, if such notice relates to the unlawfulness or asserted unlawfulness of charging interest based on the Eurodollar Rate, to make Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the
 
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender and Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate to Base Rate Loans as to which the rate of interest is not determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing and despite the illegality for such a Lender to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate, that Lender shall remain committed to make Base Rate Loans and shall be entitled to recover interest at the Base Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
 
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with a Base Rate Loan, or (iii) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with a Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

Neither the Administrative Agent's compliance with applicable Law nor its disclaimer of warranties relating to the Collateral shall be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale. To the extent the rights of notice cannot be legally waived hereunder, each Obligor agrees that any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice, specifying the place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made, is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to the Borrower in accordance with the notice provisions of of the Credit Agreement at least 10 days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral regardless of notice having been given. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any holder of Secured Obligations may be a purchaser at any such sale. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Obligors hereby waives all of its rights of redemption with respect to any such sale. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, to the extent permitted by Law, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed, or the Administrative Agent may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor the holders of the Secured Obligations shall have any liability or responsibility to any Obligor for acceptance of a check, draft or other order for payment of money bearing the legend "payment in full" or words of similar import or any other restrictive legend or endorsement or be responsible for determining the correctness of any remittance. Furthermore, the Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may communicate with account debtors on the Accounts to verify with them to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms of any Accounts.
Remedies relating to Accounts
(c) . In addition to the rights and remedies hereunder, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enter and remain upon the various premises of the Obligors in accordance with applicable Law without cost or charge to the Administrative Agent, and use the same, together with materials, supplies, books and records of the Obligors for the purpose of collecting and liquidating the Collateral, or for preparing for sale and conducting the sale of the Collateral, whether by foreclosure, auction or otherwise.

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations may have.
Nonexclusive Nature of Remedies
