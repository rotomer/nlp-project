Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If, within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e)
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment , benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available
Release
 
unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(f) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments, or removal of restrictions shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

Definitions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. (a) . From the Termination Event through the end of the Salary Continuation Period, Employee shall not directly or indirectly:
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
 
 
 
 
(b) If any restriction set forth in this Section 3 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.
(c) Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 3 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee agrees that any breach of this Section 3 will cause Teradyne irreparable harm and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, Teradyne shall have the right to seek equitable and/or injunctive relief.
(d) The geographic scope of this Section 3 shall extend to anywhere Teradyne or any of its subsidiaries is doing business, has done business or has plans to do business.

(f) If Employee violates the provisions of this Section 3, Teradyne shall be entitled to suspend and recoup any salary continuation payment made per Section 1 (d) above and Employee shall continue to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 for an additional period of time equal to the duration of the violation, such additional period not to exceed 24 months.
 
3A. . Employee understands that the employment relationship between Employee and Teradyne will be "at will" and Employee understands that, prior to any Change in Control, Teradyne may terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time, including in contemplation of a Change in Control. Following any Change in Control, Teradyne may also terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time subject to Employee's rights and Teradyne's obligations specified in this Agreement.
No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on October 19, 2001 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement
9. . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:
Notices
 
If to Employee, at Employee's address set forth on the signature page hereto.
10. . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
11. . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof.
Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).
Expenses
14. . Any payments hereunder shall be made out of the general assets of Teradyne. The Employee shall have the status of general unsecured creditor of Teradyne, and this Agreement constitutes a mere promise by Teradyne to make payments under this Agreement in the future as and to the extent provided herein. Unless otherwise determined by Teradyne in an applicable plan or arrangement, no amounts payable hereunder upon a Termination Event shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of Teradyne for the benefit of its employees. Teradyne shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding required by law.

Exhibit 99.2
AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30
th
day of December 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e)
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available
Release
 
unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(f) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments, or removal of restrictions shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

Definitions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. (a) . From the Termination Event through the end of the Salary Continuation Period, Employee shall not directly or indirectly:
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
 
 
 
 
(b) If any restriction set forth in this Section 3 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range or activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.
(c) Employee acknowledges that the restriction contained in this Section 3 is necessary for the protection of the business and good will of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee agrees that any breach of this Section 3 will cause Teradyne irreparable harm and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, Teradyne shall have the right to seek equitable and/or injunctive relief.
(d) The geographic scope of this Section 3 shall extend to anywhere Teradyne or any of its subsidiaries is doing business, has done business or has plans to do business.

(f) If Employee violates the provisions of this Section 3, Teradyne shall be entitled to suspend and recoup any salary continuation payment made per Section
 
1 (d) above and Employee shall continue to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 for an additional period of time equal to the duration of the violation, such additional period not to exceed 24 months.
3A. . Employee understands that the employment relationship between Employee and Teradyne will be "at will" and Employee understands that, prior to any Change in Control, Teradyne may terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time, including in contemplation of a Change in Control. Following any Change in Control, Teradyne may also terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time subject to Employee's rights and Teradyne's obligations specified in this Agreement.
No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on January 31, 2003 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement
9. . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:
Notices
 
If to Employee, at Employee's address set forth on the signature page hereto.
 
10. . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
11. . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof.
Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).
Expenses
14. . Any payments hereunder shall be made out of the general assets of Teradyne. The Employee shall have the status of general unsecured creditor of Teradyne, and this Agreement constitutes a mere promise by Teradyne to make payments under this Agreement in the future as and to the extent provided herein. Unless otherwise determined by Teradyne in an applicable plan or arrangement, no amounts payable hereunder upon a Termination Event shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of Teradyne for the benefit of its employees. Teradyne shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding required by law.

Exhibit 99.3
AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30
th
day of December, 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payments shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e) .
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code, all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available unless

Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(f) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits or removal of restrictions under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments, or removal of restrictions shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

(c) Employee acknowledges tat the restrictions contained in this Section 3 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee agrees that any breach of this Section 3 will cause Teradyne irreparable harm and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, Teradyne shall have the right to seek equitable and/or injunctive relief.
(d) The geographic scope of this Section 3 shall extend to anywhere Teradyne or any of its subsidiaries is doing business, has done business or has plans to do business.
(e) Employee agrees that during the Salary Continuation Periods, he/she will make reasonable good faith efforts to give verbal notice to Teradyne of each new business activity he/she plans to undertake, at least (5) business days prior to beginning any such activity.

No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on January 9, 2004 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement
9. . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:
Notices
 
If to Employee, at Employee's address set forth on the signature page hereto.

Counterparts
 
11. . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof.
Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).

AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30
th
day of December, 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee's employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of the calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e) .
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available
Release
 
unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(f) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments, or removal of restrictions shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

(b) If any restriction set forth in this Section 3 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic are, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.
(c) Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 3 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee agrees that any breach of this section 3 will cause Teradyne irreparable harm and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, Teradyne shall have the right to seek equitable and/or injunctive relief.

Employee understands that the employment relationship between Employee and Teradyne will be "at will" and Employee understands that, prior to any Change in Control, Teradyne may terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time, including in contemplation of a Change in Control. Following any Change in Control, Teradyne may also terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time subject to Employee's rights and Teradyne's obligations specified in this Agreement.
No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
Assignment
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on July 2, 2003 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement
9. . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:
Notices
 
If to Employee, at Employee's address set forth on the signature page hereto.

Counterparts
11. . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof.
Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).

13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).
Expenses

AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 30
th
day of December, 2008, by and between Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""), and the undersigned executive officer of Teradyne ("").
Teradyne
Employee
WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to benefits to be afforded to Employee upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. . If, within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below:
Entitlements Upon a Termination Event
(a) . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof.
Treatment of Awards
(b) . All of Employee's unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award.
Acceleration of Equity Awards
(c) . All of Employee's Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award, payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, "target level" is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of each calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event.
Satisfaction of Performance Criteria
(d) . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to
Salary Continuation
 1
/
12
th
of Employee's current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the "Salary Continuation Period"). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne's customary pay practices.
(e)
Deferred Compensation/Section 409A
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a " specified employee" at the time of the Employee's "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A of the Code, all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee's "separation from service" that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee).
(i)
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
 
(iii) This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
(iv) If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee's expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply; (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations.
(f) . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and "savings plan plus", profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event.
Benefit Continuation
To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee's after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs.
 
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment , benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general release, in the form of to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event; provided further that Teradyne shall be permitted to defer any payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for in this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 1(e), 1(d) or otherwise, until the tenth day after the later of its receipt of such release and the time at which the release has become valid, binding and irrevocable; provided that if the last day on which Teradyne would be permitted to commence payments, benefits [or removal of restrictions] under this Agreement in accordance with this provision falls in the taxable year following the taxable year in which the date of the Termination Event occurs, then all benefits, payments , [or removal of restrictions] shall be made beginning in that taxable year. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee's written request.

3. (a) . From the Termination Event through the end of the Salary Continuation Period, Employee shall not directly or indirectly:
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
 
 
 
(b) If any restriction set forth in this Section 3 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.
(c) Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 3 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee agrees that any breach of this Section 3 will cause Teradyne irreparable harm and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, Teradyne shall have the right to seek equitable and/or injunctive relief.
(d) The geographic scope of this Section 3 shall extend to anywhere Teradyne or any of its subsidiaries is doing business, has done business or has plans to do business.

Following any Change in Control, Teradyne may also terminate Employee with or without "Cause" at any time subject to Employee's rights and Teradyne's obligations specified in this Agreement.
No Obligation of Employment
4. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts.
Governing Law
5. . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Severability
6. . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
Waivers and Modifications
7. . (a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its affiliates would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee's employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes
Assignment
 
effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, "Teradyne" shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder.
(c) This Agreement, and Employee's and Teradyne's rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void.
(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee's estate.
8. . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the Executive Officer Change in Control Agreement entered into on October 19, 2001 and March 1, 2007 between Teradyne and Employee; provided, however, that Employee's existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect and provided further that the Agreement Regarding Termination Benefits entered into contemporaneously herewith between Teradyne and the Employee shall not be modified by this Agreement but shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its own terms. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Entire Agreement
9. . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:
Notices
 
 
If to Employee, at Employee's address set forth on the signature page hereto.
10. . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
11. . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof.
Section Headings
12. . The term of this Agreement (the "") shall commence upon the date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control), and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason).
Term
Term
13. . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee's request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne's successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee's own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13).
Expenses
14. . Any payments hereunder shall be made out of the general assets of Teradyne. The Employee shall have the status of general unsecured creditor of Teradyne, and this Agreement constitutes a mere promise by Teradyne to make payments under this Agreement in the future as and to the extent provided herein. Unless otherwise determined by Teradyne in an applicable plan or arrangement, no amounts payable hereunder upon a Termination Event shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of Teradyne for the benefit of its employees. Teradyne shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding required by law.

All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and savings plan plus, profit sharing payments and participation in the employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the Date of Termination.
Benefits:
 
To the extent that amounts paid by the Company to provide benefits under this paragraph (c), are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and to the extent any such benefits are reimbursements of expenses incurred by the Executive then the expenses eligible for reimbursement in one taxable year may not effect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in another taxable year; such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; and the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

(b) under this Section 4.2, reduce each monthly payment described in Section 4.1(a) above to the Executive by any compensation received by the Executive from other employment, consulting or the rendition of services outside the Restricted Activities.
