Convertible Senior Notes
On April 6, 2009, Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") completed a registered underwritten public offering of $190 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2014 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated March 31, 2009, among the Company, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.
The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-158282), including the prospectus supplement dated March 31, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus contained therein dated March 30, 2009, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of April 6, 2009 (the "Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Indenture (including the form of Note) is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. The terms of the Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture are described in the section of the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes entitled "Description of the Notes," which is incorporated herein by reference. The following description of the Notes and the Indenture is a summary and is not meant to be a complete description of the Notes or the Indenture. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted. The Notes will be convertible, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, at an initial conversion rate of 182.6484 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.4750, a 25% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of $4.38 per share of the Company's common stock on March 31, 2009. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at the Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, subject to the Company's option to irrevocably elect to settle all future conversions in cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and shares of common stock for any excess.
The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in cash, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the Company.
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes, and the interest accrued on such Notes, if any, to be immediately due and payable. In the case of an event of default arising out of bankruptcy events, the principal amount of the Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon will automatically become immediately due and payable.
In connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes, the following exhibits are filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference into the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-158282) relating to the Notes offering: (i) the Underwriting Agreement (Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report), (ii) the Indenture (Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report) and (iii) the legal opinion of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report).
Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
Concurrently with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "hedge counterparty") with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The convertible note hedges will cover, subject to customary antidilution adjustments, approximately 34,703,196 shares of the Company's common stock.
Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into a warrant transaction with the hedge counterparty with a strike price of $7.6650 per share, which is 75% higher than the closing price of the Company's common stock on March 31, 2009. The warrants will be net share settled and will cover, subject to customary antidilution adjustments, approximately 31,963,470 shares of the Company's common stock. On April 1, 2009, the hedge counterparty exercised its option to purchase warrants covering, subject to customary antidilution adjustments, an additional 2,739,726 shares of the Company's common stock. However, the Company will not be obligated to deliver to the hedge counterparty more than 34,526,500 shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants (which amount represents less than 19.99% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock as March 31, 2009, without giving effect to any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrant transaction), subject to customary antidilution adjustments.
The convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. However, the warrant transaction could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of the Company's common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant. The net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction to the Company, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $21.7 million.
In connection with establishing its initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparty has advised the Company that the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company's common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company's common stock or other securities, including the Notes, concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing, or preventing a decline in, the price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the hedge counterparty and/or its affiliates expect to modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the
Company's common stock or by selling the Company's common stock or other securities, including the Notes, in secondary market transactions (and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the Notes). These activities could adversely impact the value of the Company's common stock and the Notes.
The warrants were issued to the hedge counterparty pursuant to the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. There were no underwriting commissions or discounts in connection with the sale of the warrants.
The summary of each of the convertible note hedge transaction and the warrant transaction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the related agreements, which are included as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information required by Item 2.03 relating to the Notes and the Indenture is contained in Item 1.01 above under the section "Convertible Senior Notes" and is incorporated herein by reference.

In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be required to indemnify any indemnified party for any amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in settlement of any action, proceeding or investigation without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 9(d) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have responded to the indemnified party's request for reimbursement of fees and expenses of counsel prior to the date of such settlement.
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
 
sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any affiliate of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any
 
liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to
 
purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to a Subsequent Time of Delivery, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason other than circumstances arising under Section 8(f) (except for 8(f)(ii)), any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the offer, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of you as the representatives.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(d) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Engagement Letter between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. dated as of September 1, 2008.
 
18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any and all persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters, imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for definitive Notes, converted, canceled, repurchased or transferred to a transferee who receives definitive Notes therefor or any definitive Note is exchanged or transferred for part of such Global Note, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian, be appropriately reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction or increase.

Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes.
The Trustee or such authenticating agent may authenticate any such substituted Note and deliver the same upon the receipt of such security or indemnity as the Trustee, the Company and, if applicable, such authenticating agent may require. Upon the issuance of any substitute Note, the Company or the Trustee may require the payment by the holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or
 
other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Note that has matured or is about to mature or has been tendered for repurchase upon a Fundamental Change or is about to be converted into cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, in its sole discretion, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note), as the case may be, if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, including without limitation if a Note is replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and, if applicable, any Paying Agent or Conversion Agent evidence of their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.

Except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.07 and Section 7.03, all powers and remedies given by this Article 7 to the Trustee or to the Noteholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 7.06, every power and remedy given by this Article 7 or by law to the Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Noteholders.

Section 7.09. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to Notes; , , that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.04 may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default or rescind a declaration of acceleration hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the payment of premium, accrued and unpaid interest or any accrued and unpaid Extension Fee on, or the principal (including any Fundamental Change Repurchase Price) of, the Notes when due that has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.01, (ii) an uncured failure by the Company to deliver cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, upon conversion of the Notes or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article 11 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected so long as, in each case, (x) such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (y) all existing Defaults and Events of Default (other than as a result of (i) or (ii) above) that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any Default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 7.09, said Default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, that may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax that is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
(g) Except as provided in Section 15.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
(h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
(i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder shall not receive any additional cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest and any Extension Fee, except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest and any Extension Fee, to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest and any Extension Fee, to, but not including,
 
the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Interest Record Date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the Interest Record Date will receive the interest and Extension Fee, if any, payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Interest Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest and Extension Fee, if any, payable on the Notes so converted; , , that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Interest Record Date but on or prior to the next Scheduled Trading Date following the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest, if any, existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note or (3) if the Notes are surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the Interest Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on converted Notes.
provided
however
(j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record as of the close of business on (i) the Conversion Date, if the relevant Notes were converted pursuant to clause (i) of Section 15.02(a), and (ii) the last VWAP Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period if the relevant Notes were converted pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a); , if such day occurs on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, such occurrence shall not be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive any such shares of Common Stock due upon conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such occurrence shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided however
(k) For each Note surrendered for conversion and converted pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a), the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Observation Period and any fractional shares remaining after such computation, and any factional shares remaining after any conversion pursuant to clause (i) of Section 15.02(a) shall, in each case, be paid in cash. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. The Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes. Instead, the Company shall pay cash in lieu of fractional shares by multiplying the Daily VWAP of a full share of Common Stock on (i) the last VWAP Trading Day of the related Observation Period in the case of conversions pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 15.02(a) and (ii) the Conversion Date (or, if the Conversion Date is not a Trading Day, the next following Trading Day), in the case of conversions pursuant to clause (i) of Section 15.02(a), in each case, by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. The Company shall determine the number of fractional shares for which cash shall be delivered by aggregating (i) all Notes a holder surrenders for conversion and (ii) fractional shares included in the Daily Settlement Amounts over the entire related Observation Period rather than delivering cash in lieu of fractional shares for (x) each individual Note of such holder surrendered for conversion or (y) each day of the related Observation Period.
 
Section 15.03.
Increased Conversion Rate Applicable to Certain Notes Surrendered in Connection with Fundamental Changes.
(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Conversion Rate applicable to each Note that is surrendered for conversion, in accordance with this Article 15, at any time from, and including, the date that a Fundamental Change (other than a Fundamental Change described in clause (e) of the definition thereof), (a "") becomes effective (the "") until, and including, the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date corresponding to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, shall be increased to an amount equal to the Conversion Rate that would, but for this Section 15.03, otherwise apply to such Note pursuant to this Article 15, plus an amount equal to the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment.
Make-Whole Fundamental Change
Effective Date
As used herein, "" shall mean, with respect to a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the amount set forth in the following table that corresponds to the Make-Whole Reference Date and the Stock Price for such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, all as determined by the Company:
Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment
 
, that:
provided however
(i) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two Stock Prices listed in the table above under the column titled "Stock Price," or if the actual Make-Whole Reference Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two Make-Whole Reference Dates listed in the table above in the row immediately below the title "Effective Date," then the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment for such Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be determined by the Company by straight-line interpolation between the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment set forth for such higher and lower Stock Prices, or for such earlier and later Make-Whole Reference Date based on a 365 day year, as applicable;
(ii) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is greater than $50.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), or if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is less than $4.38 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in
 
clause (iii) below), then the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment shall be equal to zero and this Section 15.03 shall not require the Company to increase the Conversion Rate with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change;
(iii) if an event occurs that requires, pursuant to this Article 15 (other than solely pursuant to this Section 15.03), an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, then, on the date and at the time such adjustment is so required to be made, each price set forth in the table above under the column titled "Stock Price" shall be deemed to be adjusted so that such Stock Price, at and after such time, shall be equal to the product of (1) such Stock Price as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such Stock Price and (2) a fraction whose numerator is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Conversion Rate and whose denominator is the Conversion Rate to be in effect, in accordance with this Article 15, immediately after such adjustment to the Conversion Rate;
(iv) [Reserved];
(v) each Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment set forth in the table above shall be adjusted in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted pursuant to Section 15.04; and
(vi) in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes exceed 228.3105 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 15.04.
Nothing in this Section 15.03 shall prevent an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 15.04 in respect of a Fundamental Change.
(b) As provided in Section 15.01(b)(iii), the Company shall issue a press release indicating the Fundamental Change Effective Date. If holders are entitled to a Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment, each such press release shall also state that in connection with such Fundamental Change, the Company shall increase, in accordance herewith, the Conversion Rate applicable to Notes and the amount by which the Conversion Rate has been so increased (along with a description of how such increase shall is calculated and the time period during which Notes must be surrendered in order to be entitled to such increase).
(c) The Company will settle conversions of Notes converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change as provided in Section 15.02(a); , however, that in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change in which holders of Common Stock receive only cash consideration for their shares of Common Stock (in a single per-share amount, other than with respect to appraisal and similar rights), the Company shall settle conversions by delivering, on the 10th Business Day after the Conversion Date, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, an amount of cash equal to (i) the applicable Conversion Rate on the Conversion Date, increased by additional shares, if any, calculated as set forth in this Section 15.03, multiplied by (ii) the per-share amount of cash consideration paid in such Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
provided
Section 15.04. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
(a) If the Company issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective on (x) the Ex-Date for such dividend or other distribution or (y) the date on which such share split or share combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution described in this Section 15.04(a) is declared but not paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
(b) In case the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 60 days after the date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Ex-Date for such distribution. The Company shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of the Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights and warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. If any right or warrant described in this Section 15.04(b) is not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the right or warrant had not been issued.
(c) In case the Company shall distribute shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its Indebtedness or other of its assets or property other than (i) dividends or distributions (including share splits) covered by Section 15.04(a) and Section 15.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash and covered by Section 15.04(d), and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 15.04(c) shall apply, to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Ex- Date for such distribution; that if "FMV" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "SP
provided
0
" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive on conversion in respect of each Note held by such Noteholder, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive, the amount and kind of securities and assets such holder would have received had such holder already owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the Record Date for the distribution of the securities or assets.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 15.04(c) where there has been a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date of the Spin-Off will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where
 
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 15.04(c) shall become effective as of the close of business on the effective date of the Spin-Off. In respect of any conversion within the 10 consecutive Trading Days beginning on the Trading Day immediately following the effective date of the Spin-Off, references in this Section 15.04(c) with respect to the Spin-Off to ten consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
Subject in all respects to Section 15.10, rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 15.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 15.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 15.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 15.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
For purposes of this Section 15.04(c), Section 15.04(a), and Section 15.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 15.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 15.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 15.04(c) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by
 
this Section 15.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 15.04(a) and Section 15.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Ex-Date" and "the Ex-Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 15.04(a) and Section 15.04(b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be" within the meaning of Section 15.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 15.04(b).
If any dividend or distribution described in this Section 15.04(c) is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or announced.
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 15.04(c).
(d) If the Company pays any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 15.04(d) shall become effective on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution. If any such dividend or distribution described in this Section 15.04(d) is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 15.04(d).
(e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock and the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period beginning on and including the Trading
 
Day immediately following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective as of the close of business on the Expiration Date. In respect of any conversion within the ten consecutive Trading Days beginning on and including the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references in this Section 15.04(e) with respect to ten consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Expiration Date of such tender or exchange offer and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
If:
(1) any distribution or transaction described in Sections 15.04(a) through (e) has not yet resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate on a given Trading Day within the Observation Period applicable to Notes that Noteholders have converted; and
(2) the shares Noteholders will receive in respect of such Trading Day are not entitled to participate in the relevant distribution or transaction (because they were not held on a related Record Date or otherwise);
then the Company shall adjust the number of shares that it will deliver to Noteholders in respect of the relevant Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or transaction.
 
If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all or any portion of such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had been made only in respect of the purchases that had been effected. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 15.04(e).
(f) The term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock (or other security) have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
(g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right, option or warrant to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.
(h) Notwithstanding this Section 15.04 or any other provision of this Indenture or the Notes, if any Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective, or any Ex-Date for any issuance, dividend or distribution (relating to a required Conversion Rate adjustment) occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the open of business on a Conversion Date and ending on and including the close of business on the last VWAP Trading Day of a related Observation Period, the Board of Directors shall make adjustments to the Conversion Rate and the amount of cash or number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, as the case may be, as are necessary or appropriate to effect the intent of this Section 15.04 and the other provisions of this Article 15 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 15.04(h) shall apply in lieu of the adjustment or other term that would otherwise be applicable.
(i) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 15.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least twenty Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. The Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to this Section 15.04(i), the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.06 a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. The Company shall not take any action that would result in adjustment of the Conversion Rate (A) without complying with any New York Stock Exchange rule (which requires stockholder approval of certain issuances of stock), if applicable, or (B) in such a manner as to result in the reduction of the Conversion Price to less than the par value per share of Common Stock.
 
(j) The applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
(i) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of the Common Stock under any plan;
(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
(iv) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock in a transaction not otherwise described in this Section 15.04, regardless of the price at which such shares are issued;
(v) upon the repurchase by the Company of any of shares of the Common Stock pursuant to an open-market share repurchase program or other buy-back transaction that is not otherwise described in this Section 15.04;
(vi) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock;
(vii) for accrued and unpaid interest, including any Extension Fee; or
(viii) for any transactions described in this Section 15.04 if Noteholders may participate (as a result of holding the Notes and at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate) in any of the transactions described in this Section 15.04 as if such Noteholders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the applicable Conversion Rate at the time such adjustment would be required, by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Noteholder, without having to convert their Notes.
multiplied
(k) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 15 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
(l) The Company shall not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate. However, the Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) upon any conversion of Notes (with such adjustments to be made on each day and for each adjustment event occurring during the applicable Observation Period), (ii) such time as all adjustments that have not been made prior thereto would have the effect of adjusting the Conversion Rate by at least 1%.
(m) Except as described in this Article 15, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate.
 
(n) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, within ten days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(o) For purposes of this Section 15.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
Section 15.05. The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
Shares to Be Fully Paid.
Section 15.06. Upon the occurrence of (i) any Fundamental Change described in clause (b) of the definition thereof, (ii) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination covered by Section 15.04(a)), (iii) any consolidation, binding share exchange, recapitalization, merger, combination or other similar event involving the Company, or (iv) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a ""), then:
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale.
Merger Event
(a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 11.01 providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 15. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article 16 herein.
 
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 15.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at its address appearing on the Note Register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 15.01 and Section 15.03, at and after the effective time of such Merger Event, (i) the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes as set forth in Section 15.02 will be changed to a right to convert such Note into cash and the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the ""), and (ii) the related Conversion Obligation shall be settled as set forth under clause (c) below, it being understood and agreed that for purposes of Section 15.01(b), references therein to "the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock" shall be deemed at and after the effective time of such Merger Event to be references to "the Last Reported Sale Price of a unit of Reference Property comprised of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration." The Company shall not become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 15.06. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes as set forth in Section 15.01 and Section 15.02 prior to the effective date of such Merger Event.

Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
Section 15.10. To the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan or other "poison pill" in effect upon conversion of the Notes, each Noteholder will receive, in addition to any Common Stock and in lieu of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company has distributed
Stockholder Rights Plans.
 
to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock, evidences of Indebtedness or assets as provided in Section 15.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. Any distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to a rights plan that would allow a holder to receive upon conversion, in addition to any shares of the Common Stock, the rights described therein with respect to such Common Stock (unless such rights or warrants have separated from the Common Stock) shall not constitute a distribution of rights or warrants that would entitle a holder to an adjustment to the Conversion Rate.

In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, including any Extension Fee, on all Notes may be declared, by either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, and upon said declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions and certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture.
Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the holder has the right, at such holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such holder's Notes or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date at a price equal to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and the principal amount on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the holder who surrenders a Note to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Note. In respect of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, the Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the holders of the Notes, and in other circumstances, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures modifying the terms of the Indenture and the Notes as described therein. It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain exceptions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including any Extension Fee, on this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples thereof. At the office or agency of the Company referred to on the face hereof, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, Notes may be
 
exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations, without payment of any service charge but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessments or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the holder of the new Notes issued upon such exchange of Notes being different from the name of the holder of the old Notes surrendered for such exchange.
The Notes are not subject to redemption through the operation of any sinking fund or otherwise.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the holder hereof has the right, at its option, during certain periods and upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the Indenture, prior to the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, to convert any Notes or portion thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, at a Conversion Rate specified in the Indenture, as adjusted from time to time as provided in the Indenture.

We have examined signed copies of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission, including the exhibits thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement, and the Underwriting Agreement dated March 31, 2009, by and among the Company and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"). We have also examined and relied upon resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company, minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company as provided to us by the Company, the Restated Articles of Organization and Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company, each as restated and/or amended to date, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary for purposes of rendering the opinions hereinafter set forth.

In addition, we express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any provision of the Notes requiring the payment of interest on overdue interest.
We also express no opinion herein as to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than (i) as to the opinions given in paragraph 1, the state laws of the State of New York and (ii) as to the opinions given in paragraph 2, the state laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The "" as of any day is the fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the Number of Shares and the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on such day. In the event that Counterparty fails to provide Dealer with a Repurchase Notice on the day and in the manner specified in this Section 8(e) then Counterparty agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Dealer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (Dealer and each such person being an "") from and against any and all losses (including losses relating to the Dealer's hedging activities as a consequence of becoming, or of the risk of becoming, a Section 16 "insider", including without limitation, any forbearance from hedging activities or cessation of hedging activities and any losses in connection therewith with respect to this Transaction), claims, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Indemnified Party may become subject under applicable securities laws, including without limitation, Section 16 of the Exchange Act or under any state or federal law, regulation or regulatory order, relating to or arising out of such failure. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to any Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold harmless any Indemnified Party, then Counterparty shall contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability. In addition, Counterparty will reimburse any Indemnified Party for all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) as they are incurred (after notice to Counterparty) in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense or settlement of any pending or threatened claim or any action, suit or proceeding arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party thereto and whether or not such claim, action, suit or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf of Counterparty. This indemnity shall survive the completion of the Transaction contemplated by this Confirmation and any assignment and delegation of the Transaction made pursuant to this Confirmation or the Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any permitted assignee of Dealer.

Effectiveness
(l) . Dealer may divide any Component into additional Components and designate the Expiration Date and the Number of Warrants for each such Component if Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such further division is necessary or advisable to preserve Dealer's hedging activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions in the cash market or stock loan market or to enable Dealer to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Dealer were Issuer or an affiliated purchaser of Issuer, be compliance with
Extension of Settlement
 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In the event Dealer postpones the Expiration Date for any Component, the duration of such postponement shall be the shortest period of time that Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, is appropriate to comply with the standards set forth in the preceding sentence.
