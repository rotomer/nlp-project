Exhibit 99.1
NORTH READING, Mass.()Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $170 million for the second quarter of 2009. Semiconductor Test revenue totaled $103 million and Systems Test Group revenue totaled $67 million, which included initial Hard Disk Drive test system revenues. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne's net loss in the second quarter was $35.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which excluded restructuring charges, acquired intangible asset amortization and special items. The GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $66.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.
BUSINESS WIRE
The second quarter revenue of $170 million was $40 million above the high end of guidance while the non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.21 was slightly better than the guidance of $0.26 to $0.23. The higher revenue did not result in a smaller net loss per share due to the previously disclosed zero gross margin on the initial Hard Disk Drive test system shipments and due to inventory charges incurred in the quarter.
Bookings in the second quarter of 2009 were $227 million. Semiconductor Test orders were $138 million and Systems Test Group orders were $89 million, which included additional Hard Disk Drive test system orders.
Guidance for the third quarter of 2009 is for revenue of $190 million to $205 million, with a Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.02 to net income per share of $0.02 and a GAAP net loss per share between $0.13 and $0.09. Non-GAAP guidance excludes restructuring charges, acquired intangible asset amortization and special items.
"We saw significant improvement in our System-On-Chip (SOC) test business in the second quarter from the trough in orders in Q1," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "In SOC, bookings in the quarter were driven by improving demand in wireless and analog/power management from both integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) customers. In our Hard Disk Drive test business, customer acceptance for the majority of our initial shipments accelerated and our lead customer placed a second round of orders. We're ramping the supply chain to meet the increased demand in SOC and Hard Disk Drive at the same time that we hold the line on costs."

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP (loss)/income and non-GAAP (loss)/income per share refer to net (loss)/income and net (loss)/income per common share excluding goodwill impairment, in-process research and development, amortization of the GAAP imputed convertible debt discount, write-off of credit line debt issue costs, restructuring and other, net, certain inventory provision reversals, fair value inventory step-up related to Nextest and Eagle Test, losses on marketable securities and acquired intangible asset amortization, as well as applicable adjustments to profit sharing and income taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining net (loss)/income. Non-GAAP (loss)/income (which is the basis for non-GAAP (loss)/income per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of our current core business or future outlook.
The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.
