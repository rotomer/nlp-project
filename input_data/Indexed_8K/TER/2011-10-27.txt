Bookings in the third quarter of 2011 were $240 million of which $196 million were in Semiconductor Test and $44 million in the Systems Test Group.
"Record hard disk drive test shipments in the third quarter combined with our lean operating model to produce our seventh consecutive quarter of above model profitability," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne President and CEO. "Semiconductor test orders and revenue softened in line with industry trends during the quarter, but we continued to see relative strength in the mobility segments driven by power management, image sensors, wireless and mobile processors."
"Our recent acquisition of LitePoint adds another growth engine to Teradyne's portfolio of test solutions," noted Bradley. "This strategic use of capital significantly enlarges our served market into wireless product testing."
Guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is for revenue of $270 million to $300 million, with non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.08 to $0.16 and GAAP loss from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.10 to $0.02. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, acquisition related costs and estimated GAAP purchase accounting charges related to the LitePoint acquisition.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations exclude acquired intangible asset amortization, non- cash convertible debt interest, and restructuring and other, net. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP income from continuing operations, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne's current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne's call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne's financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne's results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at www.teradyne.com by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link.
