Bookings in the first quarter of 2012 were $458 million of which $363 million were in Semiconductor Test, $53 million in the Systems Test Group and $42 million in LitePoint Wireless Test.
"Record UltraFlex System-on-a-Chip (SOC) orders drove our Semiconductor Test bookings in the first quarter," said Mike Bradley, President and CEO. "High performance mobile devices continue to drive demand in our Semiconductor and LitePoint Wireless Test segments. In Storage Test, we delivered the second highest revenue in our history as earlier design wins ramp into volume production. Looking ahead, with the mobility outlook remaining strong, we've raised our second quarter revenue plan to meet customer needs."
Guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is revenue of $490 million to $530 million, with non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.53 to $0.62 and GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.37. Non-GAAP guidance excludes acquired intangible asset and inventory fair value amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, and restructuring and other charges.
Change in Pension Accounting Method
In the first quarter of 2012, we elected to change our method of recognizing gains and losses for our defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefits. We believe the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses in our operating results and will improve financial transparency.
We previously recognized gains and losses as a component of shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets annually and amortized them into our operating results to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a specified range. We will now recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses
annually in the fourth quarter of each year. We have applied these changes retrospectively, as required.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations exclude acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, fair value inventory step-up related to LitePoint, pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses, and restructuring and other, net. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP income from continuing operations, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne's current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes charges related to the fair value inventory step-up recorded as part of acquisition purchase accounting and pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses. GAAP requires that this item be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for the Company's current core business and future outlook and for comparison with our business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of the Company's competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne's call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne's financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne's results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at www.teradyne.com by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release may not be
 
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.
