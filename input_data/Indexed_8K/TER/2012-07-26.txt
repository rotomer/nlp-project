NORTH READING, Mass.  July 25, 2012  Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported revenue of $548 million for the second quarter of 2012 of which $365 million was in Semiconductor Test, $112 million in LitePoint Wireless Test and $71 million in the Systems Test Group.

GAAP income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $111 million, or $0.49 per diluted share.
Bookings in the second quarter of 2012 were $592 million of which $358 million were in Semiconductor Test, $189 million in LitePoint Wireless Test and $45 million in the Systems Test Group.
"Explosive growth in our LitePoint Wireless Test segment and continued strength for the UltraFLEX in high performance System-on-a-Chip test powered Teradyne's results in the second quarter," said Mike Bradley, President and CEO. "LitePoint delivered record orders and revenue as customers continue to embrace its time to market and economic advantages in the fast moving mobility market. After recording a very strong first half, our third quarter outlook reflects seasonally slower industry trends."

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations exclude acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, fair value inventory step-up related to LitePoint, pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses, and restructuring and other net, and include income taxes on a cash basis. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from
operations, non-GAAP income from continuing operations, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP measures presented to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of Teradyne's current core business or future outlook. These non-GAAP measures are used to make operational decisions, to determine employee compensation, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes charges related to the fair value inventory step-up recorded as part of acquisition purchase accounting and pension and post retirement actuarial gains and losses. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin dollar amount and percentage are non-GAAP measures that management believes provide useful supplemental information for management and the investor. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin as a performance measure for Teradyne's current core business and future outlook and for comparison with Teradyne's business plan, historical gross margin results and the gross margin results of Teradyne's competitors. Non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of Teradyne's call option on its shares. Management believes each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information for investors, allowing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision making and in the review of Teradyne's financial and operational performance, as well as facilitating meaningful comparisons of Teradyne's results in the current period compared with those in prior and future periods. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibits and on the Teradyne website at www.teradyne.com by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link.
