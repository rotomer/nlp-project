Exhibit 99
        
MINNEAPOLIS, August 15, 2002
  Target Corporation today reported earnings per share for the second quarter ended August 3, 2002 of 38 cents, compared with 30 cents in the second quarter ended August 4, 2001. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. Second quarter net earnings increased 26.8 percent to $344 million, compared with $271 million in 2001.
        "We are extremely pleased with our second quarter results, particularly our continued momentum at Target Stores," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "This performance reinforces our confidence in our ability to deliver strong profitable growth in 2002 and generate considerable value for our shareholders over the long-term."
        Total revenues in the second quarter increased 12.6 percent to $10.068 billion from $8.941 billion in 2001, driven by a 16.2 percent revenue increase at Target Stores. Comparable-store sales for the second quarter 2002 increased 3.0 percent. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
        In the second quarter, gross margin rate increased from the prior year, primarily due to strong improvement at both Target Stores and Mervyn's. (Gross margin rate represents gross margin as a percentage of sales.) Expense rate, excluding credit card operations, was unfavorable to prior year, as growth in expense was only partially offset by the benefit of overall growth at Target, our lowest expense rate division. (Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. It includes buying and occupancy, advertising, start-up and other expense, and excludes depreciation and expenses associated with credit card operations.)
        For the quarter, pre-tax segment profit increased 31.4 percent to $785 million, compared with $598 million in the second quarter 2001. Pre-tax profit at Target Stores increased $186 million, or 35.5 percent. Pre-tax profit at Mervyn's declined $1 million and pre-tax profit at Marshall Field's improved by $2 million. (Pre-tax segment profit is earnings before LIFO, securitization effects, interest, other expense and unusual items.)
        Contribution from the company's credit card operations increased to $129 million in the second quarter from $103 million a year ago. At quarter-end, gross receivables serviced were $4.636 billion, compared with $2.687 billion at the end of second quarter 2001, due to the continued growth in usage of the Target Visa. The provision for bad debt expense exceeded write-offs by $35 million in the quarter, while delinquency trends improved from the same period a year ago, primarily due to the growth of higher quality Target Visa receivables. Results of credit card operations are included in the pre-tax segment profit for each of the company's three business segments.
Other Factors
        Net interest expense and interest equivalent for the quarter increased $32 million compared with second quarter 2001, of which $16 million is related to the repurchase of debt. The increase in net interest expense is due to substantially higher average funded balances, partially offset by the benefit of a lower average portfolio interest rate.
        The company's annual effective income tax rate is 38.2 percent, compared with 38.0 percent last year.
Miscellaneous
        Separately, the corporation announced today that CEO Bob Ulrich and CFO Doug Scovanner plan to sign and file the certifications required by the SEC, following their review with the company's audit committee and Board of Directors. This filing is due in conjunction with the corporation's second quarter Form 10-Q filing, on or before September 17, 2002.
