"Sales in June were on plan at both Target Stores and Marshall Field's and well below plan at Mervyn's," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "Given the significance of this month's contribution to our second quarter earnings performance, we now expect our most likely EPS outcome in the quarter to be $0.39 or $0.40."
