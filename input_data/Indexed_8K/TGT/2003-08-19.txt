Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Target Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell from time to time its Medium-Term Notes, Series J (the "Securities"), in an aggregate amount up to $1,850,000,000 and agrees with each of you (individually, an "Agent", and collectively, the "Agents") as set forth in this Agreement.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Securities directly on its own behalf or indirectly through other agents, the Company hereby (i) appoints each Agent as an agent of the Company for the purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Securities from the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof and (ii) agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated herein, whenever it determines to sell Securities directly to any Agent as principal, it will enter into a separate agreement (each a "Terms Agreement"), substantially in the form of Annex I hereto, relating to such sale in accordance with Section 2(b) hereof.  This Distribution Agreement shall not be construed to create either an obligation on the part of the Company to sell any Securities or an obligation of any of the Agents to purchase Securities as principal.
 
The Securities will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2000, as amended or supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee").  The Securities shall have the maturity ranges, interest rates and other terms set forth in the Prospectus referred to below as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time.  The Securities will be issued, and the terms thereof established, from time to time by the Company in accordance with the Indenture.
 
The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Agent that:
1.
                                      
 
A registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-82500) in respect of the Securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to such Agent, excluding exhibits to such registration statement, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus included in the registration statement, has been declared effective by the Commission in such form; no other document with respect to such registration statement or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than the prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") each in the form heretofore delivered to the Agents); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in such registration statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, is hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus"; the various parts of such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in

(f)

The Company may from time to time sell Securities otherwise than through an Agent and may engage another agent with respect to a specific purchase, provided that the Agents are given notice of such purchase promptly after it is consummated.  The Company reserves the right to add another agent as a party to this Agreement.  The Company also reserves the right to sell, and may solicit and accept offers to purchase, Securities directly on its own behalf.  In
2.
                                      
                                 
the case of any such sale not resulting from a solicitation made by any Agent, no commission will be payable under this Agreement with respect to such sale.  These provisions shall not limit Section 4(f) hereof or any similar provision included in any Terms Agreement.
 
Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of Securities, the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities and the payment in each case therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedure attached hereto as Annex II as it may be amended from time to time by written agreement between the Agents and the Company (the "Administrative Procedure").  The provisions of the Administrative Procedure shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder other than those made pursuant to a Terms Agreement (unless such Terms Agreement specifically provides that such provisions shall apply).  Each Agent and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of them in the Administrative Procedure.  The Company will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Administrative Procedure as from time to time in effect.
 
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities.  As soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day in New York City, after receipt of notice from the Company, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.  During such period, the Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k).  Upon advising the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed, however, the Company shall, upon request of the Agents (unless the Company has accepted an offer to purchase Securities, in which case no such request shall be necessary), simultaneously provide the documents required to be delivered by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k), and the Agents shall have no obligation to solicit offers to purchase the Securities until such documents, if so requested, have been received by the Agents.  In addition, any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations hereunder, including without limitation its obligation to deliver the documents required by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k), shall automatically terminate the Agents' obligations hereunder to solicit offers to purchase the Securities hereunder as agent.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent, the Company agrees to pay to each Agent (or jointly to two or more of the Agents if such solicitation is jointly made) a commission, at the time of settlement of any sale of a Security by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount equal to the following percentage of the principal amount of such Security sold:
 
 
Each Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Securities other than those rejected by such Agent.  The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Securities and may reject any proposed purchase of Securities as a whole or in part.  Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any offer received by it to purchase Securities, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection by such Agent shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein.
 
Each sale of Securities to any Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (unless the Company and such Agent shall otherwise agree) a Terms Agreement which will provide for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase thereof by, such Agent.  A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Securities by such Agent.  Any Agent's commitment to purchase Securities as principal pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.  Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of Securities to be purchased by any Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Company for such Securities, any provisions relating to rights of, and default by, underwriters acting together with such Agent in the reoffering of the Securities, and the time, date and place of delivery of and payment for such Securities.  Such Terms Agreement shall also specify the procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of such Securities and any requirements for officers' certificates, opinions of counsel and accountants' letters pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Each Agent proposes to offer Securities purchased by it as principal for sale at prevailing market
(b)
                                
prices or prices related thereto at the time of sale, which may be equal to, greater than or less than the price at which such Securities are purchased by such Agent from the Company.
 
For each sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of such Securities and payment therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedure.  For each such sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company agrees to pay such Agent a commission (or grant an equivalent discount) as provided in Section 2(a) hereof and in accordance with the schedule set forth therein.
 
Each time and date of delivery of and payment for Securities to be purchased by any Agent as principal, whether set forth in a Terms Agreement or in accordance with the Administrative Procedure, is referred to herein as a "Time of Delivery."
 
Each Agent agrees, with respect to any Security denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, as agent, directly or indirectly, not to solicit offers to purchase, and as principal under any Terms Agreement or otherwise, directly or indirectly, not to offer, sell or deliver, such Security in, or to residents of, the country issuing such currency, except as permitted by applicable law.
(c)
                                 
 
The documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6 hereof on the Commencement Date (as defined below) shall be delivered to the Agents at the offices of King & Spalding LLP, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on August 19, 2003 (the "Commencement Date").

(ii)
                                 
to make no amendment or supplement at any time to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, other than any Pricing Supplement, prior to having afforded each Agent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, , that the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, except that the Company will cause copies of such filings to be delivered to the Agents promptly after being transmitted for filing with the Commission; that to the extent any Agent shall disapprove of any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission required to be so filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, such Agent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company until such time as the Company amends such filing or takes such other action as is satisfactory to such Agent with respect to such filing;
(iii)
                              
provided, however
provided, further, however,
 
to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such same period to advise such Agent, promptly after the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or has become effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus (other than any Pricing Supplement that relates to Securities not purchased through or by such Agent and other than documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and
(iv)
                             
 
in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any such prospectus or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal;
(v)
                                
 
Promptly from time to time to take such action as such Agent may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as such Agent may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution or sale of the Securities; that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;

(j)
                                    
 
(a)The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any other prospectus relating to the Securities or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein.
7.
                                      
                                 
provided, however,
 
Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only
(b)
                                
to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(c)
                                 
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or
(d)
                                
payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Securities purchased by or through it were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
(e)
                                 
 
Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Securities from the Company and in performing the other obligations of such Agent hereunder (other than in respect of any purchase by an Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise), is acting solely as an agent for the Company, and not as principal.  Each Agent will make reasonable
8.
                                      
efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company has been accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase for any reason is not consummated.  If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company.
 
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements by any Agent and the Company set forth in or pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Agent or the Company or any of its officers, directors or controlling persons, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Securities.
9.
                                      
 
The provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company as to any or all Agents or by any Agent as to such Agent upon the giving of written notice of such suspension or termination to such Agent or the Company, as the case may be.  In addition, this Agreement may be terminated at any time by the Company as to any or all Agents or by any Agent as to such Agent upon the giving of written notice of such termination to such Agent or the Company, as the case may be.  In the event of such suspension or termination with respect to any Agent, (X) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any Agent as to which such suspension or termination has not occurred, (Y) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to rights and obligations of any party which have previously accrued and which relate to Securities already issued or agreed to be issued (as a result of the acceptance by the Company of any offer to purchase Securities) at the time of such suspension or termination, and (Z) in any event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect insofar as the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), and Sections 4(d), 4(e), 5, 7, 8 and 9 hereof are concerned.

Procedures Relating to Settlement:
ANNEX II
This Administrative Procedure relates to the Securities defined in the Distribution Agreement, dated August 19, 2003 (the "Distribution Agreement"), among Target Corporation (the "Company"), Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Banc of America Securities LLC, Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc. (together, the "Agents"), to which this Administrative Procedure is attached as Annex II.  Defined terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Distribution Agreement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or the Indenture.  To the extent any procedure set forth below conflicts with the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture or the Distribution Agreement, the relevant provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Distribution Agreement shall control.
 
The procedures to be followed with respect to the settlement of sales of Securities directly by the Company to purchasers solicited by an Agent, as agent, are set forth below.  The terms and settlement details related to a purchase of Securities by an Agent, as principal, from the Company will be set forth in a Terms Agreement pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, unless the Company and such Agent otherwise agree as provided in Section 2(b) of the Distribution Agreement, in which case the procedures to be followed in respect of the settlement of such sale will be as set forth below. An Agent, in relation to a purchase of a Security by a purchaser solicited by such Agent, is referred to herein as the "Selling Agent" and, in relation to a purchase of a Security by such Agent as principal other than pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as the "Purchasing Agent."
 
The Company will advise each Agent of those persons at the Company with whom such Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Securities and the related settlement details.
 
The Trustee will be the initial Registrar, Calculation Agent, Authenticating Agent and Paying Agent for the Securities and will perform the duties specified herein.  Each Security will be issued only in fully registered form and will be represented by either a global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC (a "Book-Entry Security") or a certificate issued in definitive form (a "Certificated Security") delivered to a person designated by an Agent, as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. An owner of a Book-Entry Security will not be entitled to receive a certificate representing such a Security, except as provided in the Indenture.
Book-Entry Securities, which may be payable only in U.S. dollars, will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure set forth in Part I hereof as they may subsequently be amended as the result of changes in DTC's operating procedures and Certificated Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure set forth in Part II hereof.
 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE FOR BOOK-ENTRY SECURITIES
PART I:
                            
 
In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Securities for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company and the Trustee to DTC, dated the date hereof, and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee and DTC dated as of May 26, 1989 (the "Certificate Agreement"), and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").
 
Posting Rates by the Company:
 
The Company and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of interest per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Book-Entry Securities that may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent.  The Company may establish a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an offering period ("posting").  If the Company decides to change already posted rates, it will promptly advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers until the new posted rates have been established with the Agents.
 
Acceptance of Offers by the Company:
 
Each Agent will promptly advise the Company by telephone or other appropriate means of all reasonable offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities, other than those rejected by such Agent.  Each Agent may, in its discretion reasonably exercised, reject any offer received by it in whole or in part.  Each Agent also may make offers to the Company to purchase Book-Entry Securities as a Purchasing Agent.  The Company will have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in part.
 
The Company will promptly notify the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, of its acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities.  If the Company accepts an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities, it will confirm such acceptance in writing to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, and the Trustee.
 
Communication of Sale Information to the Company by Selling Agent and Settlement Procedures:
 
After the acceptance of an offer by the Company, the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, will communicate promptly, but in no event later than
A.

The Company will arrange to file a copy of the Pricing Supplement with the Commission not later than the close of business of the Commission on the fifth Business Day following the date on which such Pricing Supplement is first used.
 
Deliveries of Pricing Supplements made in accordance with this section, if sent to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, shall be sufficient when delivered to Merrill Lynch Production Technologies, 4 Corporate Place, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, Attention: Diane Walker, Email Address: mtnsuppl@na2.us.ml.com, Fax No. (732) 878-6481, Phone No. (732) 878-6536, and if sent to Citigroup Global Markets Inc., shall be sufficient when delivered to Brooklyn Army Terminal, 140 58th Street, 5th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11220, Attention:  Diane Graham, Fax No. (718) 765-6734, Phone No. (718) 765-6736.
 
In each instance that a Pricing Supplement is prepared, the relevant Agent will provide a copy of such Pricing Supplement to each investor or purchaser of the relevant Book-Entry Security or its agent.  Pursuant to Rule 434 under the Securities Act, the Pricing Supplement may be delivered separately from the Prospectus.  Outdated Pricing Supplements (other than those retained for files) will be destroyed.
Delivery of Confirmation and Prospectus to Purchaser by Selling Agent:
 
The Selling Agent will deliver to the purchaser of a Book-Entry Security a written confirmation of the sale and delivery and payment instructions.  In addition, the Selling Agent will deliver to such purchaser or its agent the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing Supplement) in relation to such Book-Entry Security prior to or together with the earlier of the delivery to such purchaser or its agent of (a) the confirmation of sale or (b) the Book-Entry Security.
 
Date of Settlement:
 
The receipt by the Company of immediately available funds in payment for a Book-Entry Security and the authentication and issuance of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security shall constitute "settlement" with respect to such Book-Entry Security.  All orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Company on a particular date (the "Trade Date") will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date") which is on or before the third Business Day after the Trade Date pursuant to the "Settlement Procedure Timetable" set forth below, unless the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on another day, which shall be no earlier than the next Business Day after the Trade Date.
 
Settlement Procedure Timetable:
 
For offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent and accepted by the Company for settlement on the first Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "A" through "J" set forth above shall be completed as soon as possible but not later than the respective times (New York City time) set forth below:
 
 
If a sale is to be settled more than one Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures A, B and C shall be completed as soon as practicable but in no event later that 11:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., as the case may be, on the first Business Day after the Trade Date.  If the initial interest rate for a Floating Rate Book-Entry Security has not been determined at
the time that Settlement Procedure "A" is completed and the Settlement Date is at least three Business Days after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined but no later than 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon, respectively, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date.  Settlement Procedure "I" is subject to extension in accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the Settlement Date.
 
If settlement of a Book-Entry Security is rescheduled or cancelled, the Trustee, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, will deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Settlement Date.
 
Failure to Settle:
 
If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a Book-Entry Security pursuant to Settlement Procedure "G", the Trustee may deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing DTC to debit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account, provided that the Trustee's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security that is at least equal to the principal amount to be debited.  If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will mark such Global Security "cancelled", make appropriate entries in the Trustee's records and send such cancelled Global Security to the Company.  The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with the procedures of the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's Corporation, be cancelled and not immediately reassigned.  If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will exchange such Global Security for two Global Securities, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Security or Securities and shall be cancelled immediately after issuance and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry Securities previously represented by the surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Security.
 
If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Security is not timely paid to the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in DTC, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such participants and, in turn, the Agent for such Book-Entry Security may enter delivery orders through DTC's Participant Terminal System debiting such Book-Entry Security to such participant's account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's account and then debiting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account and shall notify the Company and the Trustee thereof.  Thereafter, the Trustee will (i) immediately notify the Company of such order and the Company shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use in an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security which was credited to the
account of the Company maintained at the Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedure J, and (ii) deliver the withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph.  If such failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable Agent to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use of funds during the period when the funds were credited to the account of the Company.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry Security, DTC may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect.  In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedures  "D", "E" and G, for the authentication and issuance of a Global Security representing the other Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by such Global Security and will make appropriate entries in its records.  The Company will, from time to time, furnish the Trustee with a sufficient quantity of Securities.

General
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of August 4, 2000, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series of the Securities, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $1,850,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies, designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series J, of the Company.  The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
 
Events of Default
 
If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
Modification and Waivers; Obligation of the Company Absolute
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series,
to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except that in the event the Company deposits money or Government Obligations as provided in Section 401 or 403 of the Indenture, such payments will be made only from proceeds of such money or Government Obligations.
 
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
 
Redemption
 
If so provided on the face hereof, the Company may at its option redeem this Security in whole or from time to time in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof) on or after the date designated as the Initial Redemption Date on the face hereof at 100% of the unpaid principal amount hereof or the portion thereof redeemed multiplied by a percentage (the "Redemption Percentage"), together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.  The Redemption Percentage shall initially be equal to the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof and shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the amount of the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction specified on the face hereof, until the Redemption Percentage is equal to 100%.  The Company may exercise such option by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.  In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, the Company shall issue a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.  If less than all of the Securities of this series with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
Sinking Fund
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, this Security will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
Repayment
 
If so provided on the face hereof, this Security will be repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date at the option of the Holder, in whole or in part and in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this Security surrendered for partial repayment shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination hereof), on or after the date designated as an Optional Repayment Date on the face hereof at 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, plus accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date.  In order for this Security to be repaid, the Company must receive at the applicable address of the Paying Agent set forth below or at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holder of the within Security, at least 30 but not more than 45 days prior to an Optional Repayment Date, either (i) this Security, with the form below entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter from a member of a national securities exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or a trust company in the United States of America setting forth (a) the name, address and telephone number of the Holder of this Security, (b) the principal amount of this Security and the amount of this Security to be repaid, (c) a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby, and (d) a guarantee stating that the Company will receive this Security, with the form below entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, not later than five Business Days after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter (and this Security and form duly completed are received by the Company by such fifth Business Day).

All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any Security for repayment will be determined by the Company, whose determination will be final and binding.  Upon any partial repayment, this Security shall be cancelled and a new Security or Securities for the remaining principal amount hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder of this Security.

Unless otherwise provided on the face hereof, this Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.
 
Registration of Transfer
 
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company maintained in New York City or Chicago, Illinois, a new Security or Securities of this series in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.

General
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of August 4, 2000, as amended or supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series of the Securities, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount of $1,850,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies, designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series J, of the Company.  The Securities of this series may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount and be denominated in different currencies.
 
Interest Rate Reset
 
The interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof.  Commencing with the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which interest on this Security is payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually or on another basis as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Reset Period."  Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be.  Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Security shall be the rate determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below and adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be the following Business Day, except that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR and if such following Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
Accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount by an accrued interest factor.  Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid.  Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such day by 360, if the Base Rate is the CD Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or the Prime Rate or by the actual number of days in the year, if the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate or the CMT Rate.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, all percentages resulting from any calculation referred to herein shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of one percentage point rounded upward.  For example 9.876545% or .09876545 would be rounded to 9.87655% or .0987655 and 9.876544% or .09876544 would be rounded to 9.87654% or .0987654.  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any such calculation on this Security shall be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upwards.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof.  The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
 
The interest rate on this Security shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by Minnesota law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that shall become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security.  The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.
 
Determination of CD Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is CD Rate, the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified on the face hereof (each, a "CD Interest Determination Date") will equal the rate on that date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest
Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("") under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)."
H.15(519)
 
The following procedures shall be followed if the CD Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the CD Rate shall be the rate on the applicable CD Interest Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the world wide website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication ("H.15 Daily Update"), or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying this rate, for the day in respect of certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof under the caption "CDs (secondary market)."
 - 
                 
 
If that rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or the H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that CD Interest Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for negotiable certificates of deposit in a denomination not less than $5,000,000 of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the market at the time.
 - 
                 
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described in the previous bullet point, the CD Rate in effect immediately before that CD Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the CD Rate in effect on that CD Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
Determination of CMT Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is CMT Rate, the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified on the face hereof (each, a "CMT Interest Determination Date") will equal the rate displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page (as defined below) under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities . . . Federal Reserve Board Release H.15 . . . Mondays Approximately 3:45 p.m.," under the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (as defined below) for:
 
if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7051, that CMT Interest Determination Date; and
 - 
                 
if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the week or the month, as applicable, ended immediately before the week in which the related CMT Interest Determination Date occurs.
 - 
                 
 
The following procedures will be used if the CMT Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
If that rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or if not displayed by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate will be the treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (as defined below) as published in H.15(519) for that CMT Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
If that rate is no longer published, or if not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate will be the treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index, or other United States Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index, for the CMT Interest Determination Date with respect to that Interest Reset Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page and published in H.15(519).
 - 
                 
 
If that information is not provided by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the CMT Rate to be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market closing offer side prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Interest Determination Date reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers (each, a "Reference Dealer") in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent as described in the following sentence.  The Calculation Agent will select five Reference Dealers, after consultation with the Company, and will eliminate the highest quotation, or, in the event of overlap, one of the highest, and the lowest quotation, or, in the event of overlap, one of the lowest, for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury notes") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year.
 - 
                 
 
If the Calculation Agent cannot obtain three Treasury notes quotations, the Calculation Agent will determine the CMT Rate to be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offer side prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in New York City, selected
 - 
                 
using the same method described above, for Treasury notes with an original maturity of the number of years closest to but not less than the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount of at least $100,000,000.  If two Treasury notes with an original maturity as described above have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, the Calculation Agent will obtain quotations for the Treasury note with the shorter remaining term to maturity.
 
If three or four, but not five, of the Reference Dealers are quoting as described in the previous two bullet points, then the CMT Rate will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offer prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest quotes will be eliminated.
 - 
                 
 
If fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described above, the CMT Rate in effect immediately prior to that CMT Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the CMT Rate in effect on that CMT Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
"Designated CMT Telerate Page" means the display on Moneyline Telerate, or any successor service, on the page specified on the face hereof, or any other page as may replace that page on that service for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519).  If no page is specified, the Designated CMT Telerate Page will be 7052, for the most recent week.
 
"Designated CMT Maturity Index" means the original period to maturity of the U.S. Treasury securities (either 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20 or 30 years) specified on the face hereof with respect to which the CMT Rate will be calculated.
 
Determination of Commercial Paper Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is Commercial Paper Rate, the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified on the face hereof (each, a "Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date") will equal the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Commercial PaperNonfinancial."
 
"Money Market Yield" will be a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
where "D" refers to the applicable annual rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being calculated.
 
The following procedures will be followed if the Commercial Paper Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
If the above rate is not published by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on the applicable Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying this rate, under the heading "Commercial PaperNonfinancial."
 - 
                 
 
If that rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "Aa," "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating agency.
 - 
                 
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described in the previous bullet point, the Commercial Paper Rate in effect immediately before that Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on that Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
Determination of Federal Funds Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is Federal Funds Rate, the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified on the face hereof (each, a "Federal Funds Interest Determination Date") will equal the rate on that day for federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)" as displayed on Moneyline Telerate or any successor service on page 120 or any other page as may replace the applicable page on that service.
The following procedures will be followed if the Federal Funds Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
If the above rate is not published by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on the applicable Federal Funds Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying this rate, under the heading "Federal Funds/(Effective)."
 - 
                 
 
If that rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar Federal Funds arranged by each of three leading brokers of U.S. dollar Federal Funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with us, prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Federal Funds Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described in the previous bullet point, the Federal Funds Rate in effect immediately before that Federal Funds Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Federal Funds Rate in effect on that Federal Funds Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
Determination of LIBOR
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR"), the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified on the face hereof (each, a "LIBOR Interest Determination Date") will be determined by the Calculation Agent as follows:
 
As of the LIBOR Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be either:
 - 
                 
 
if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on the face hereof, the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in the Index Currency (as defined below) having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, that appear on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date; provided, however, that if LIBOR Reuters by its terms provides for only a single rate, that single rate will be used; or
 - 
                 
 
if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof or if neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof as the method for calculating LIBOR, the rate for deposits in the Index Currency having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on
 - 
                 
that Interest Reset Date, that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date.
 
If no applicable rates appear, LIBOR on the LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in the bullet points below.
 
With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which no applicable rates appear on the Designated LIBOR Page as specified in the bullet points above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in the Index Currency for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount not less than $1,000,000 (or the equivalent in the Index Currency as applicable) that is representative of a single transaction in that Index Currency in such market at such time.  If at least two quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations.
 - 
                 
 
If only one or no quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the applicable principal financial center for the country of the Index Currency, on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in that principal financial center selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, for loans in the Index Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount not less than $1,000,000 (or the equivalent in the Index Currency as applicable) that is representative of a single transaction in that Index Currency in that market at that time.
 - 
                 
 
If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described in the previous bullet point, LIBOR in effect immediately before that LIBOR Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the LIBOR in effect on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
For purposes of the preceding discussion, the following capitalized terms have the following meanings:
 
"Index Currency" means the currency, including composite currencies, specified on the face hereof as the currency for which LIBOR will be calculated.  If no currency is specified, the Index Currency will be U.S. dollars.

The following procedures will be followed if the Prime Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
If the rate is not published before 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on that Prime Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying this rate, under the heading "Bank Prime Loan."
 - 
                 
 
If the rate is not published before 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME 1 Page (as defined below) as that bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Prime Interest Determination Date.
 - 
                 
 
If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, fewer than four rates appear on the Reuters Screen US PRIME 1 Page on that Prime Interest Determination Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates, quoted on
 - 
                 
the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360, as of the close of business on that Prime Interest Determination Date by at least three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company.
 
If the banks selected are not quoting as described in the previous bullet point, the Prime Rate in effect immediately prior to that Prime Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Prime Rate in effect on that Prime Interest Determination Date.

page 57, or any other page as may replace that page on that service ("Telerate Page 57"); or
 - 
                 
 
if not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield (as defined below) of the rate for the applicable Treasury bills as published in H.15(519) Daily Update, or any  other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying that rate, under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High."
 - 
                 
 
The following procedures will be followed if the Treasury Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 
If the above rate is not published before 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the auction rate of the applicable Treasury bills on that Treasury Interest Determination Date as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury.
 - 
                 
In the event that the auction rate of Treasury bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof is not published or announced as provided in the previous bullet point before 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, or if no such auction is held on that Treasury Interest Determination Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Treasury Rate to be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on that Treasury Interest Determination Date of Treasury bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market" or, if not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on that Treasury Interest Determination Date of the applicable Treasury bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market."  If that rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, then the Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on that Treasury Interest Determination Date, of three leading primary United States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent, after consultation with us, for the issue of Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof.
