(B)
                               
 
Prior to the Cut-Off Date, Sellers shall provide audited financial statements for the Business for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, accompanied by an unqualified opinion of Ernst & Young LLP, to the effect that the audited financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position and results of operations of the Business and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, consistently applied, together with:
(ii)
                                 
 
adjustments to the audited balance sheet to reflect the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (which adjustments are referred to as "transaction adjustments"); and

For the avoidance of doubt, "Net Assets" shall not include any Excluded Asset or any Excluded Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(b), the book value of all assets on the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of the Cut-Off Date shall be calculated without giving effect to any depreciation or amortization thereof after May 1, 2004.
(iv)
                             
Exhibit M
 
To the extent that the Net Assets reflected in the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of 5/1/2004 exceed the Net Assets reflected in the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of the Cut-Off Date by more than $40 million, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the excess over $40 million.
(v)

If the Purchase Price is to be decreased pursuant to Section 4(b)(v), then Sellers shall, within five business days after the amount of such decrease has been determined, pay Buyer an amount equal to such decrease, together with interest thereon at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate in effect as of the Closing Date, calculated on the actual number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the date of payment divided by 365.

(vii)

(viii)
                       
Transaction Balance Sheet as of 5/1/2004, and that the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of the Cut-Off Date will be prepared on a basis consistent with the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of 5/1/2004 (except for the audit adjustments, as appropriate, and except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(b)(iv) and 7(e)).
 
If Buyer in good faith objects, by notice in writing to Sellers, to the Net Assets set forth on the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of the Cut-Off Date ("Final Net Assets") within 30 days after Sellers' delivery thereof, setting forth in its written objection its determination of Final Net Assets, Sellers and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections within 30 days after the Sellers' receipt of Buyer's objections.  Buyer may object pursuant to this Section 4(b)(ix) only if, assuming all of Buyer's objections were sustained, the Purchase Price, as adjusted by any adjustments pursuant to this Section 4(b), would be lower than the Purchase Price based on Sellers' determination of Final Net Assets, and Buyer's objections must specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement with Sellers.  The only objections that Buyer may make pursuant to this Section 4(b)(ix) are those that relate to:
(ix)
                               
 
any claimed inconsistencies between the principles, policies or procedures used in the preparation of the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of 5/1/2004 and the principles, policies or procedures used in the preparation of the Unaudited Transaction Balance Sheet as of the Cut-Off Date (except for audit adjustments, as appropriate, and except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(b)(iv) and 7(e));

errors in mathematical computation.
(C)
                               
 
If Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve the matter within such 30-day period, they shall jointly appoint a mutually acceptable firm of independent accountants of national reputation that is one of the so-called "big four" (or, if they cannot agree on a mutually acceptable firm, they shall cause their respective accounting firms to select such firm) within three business days following the end of such 30-day period.  Buyer and Sellers shall provide such accounting firm full cooperation.  Such firm shall be instructed to reach its conclusion regarding the disputes as soon as reasonably possible.  Such firm's resolution of the disputes shall be rendered in a written decision determining all disputes and shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Sellers.
(x)
                                  
The Non-Prevailing Party (as defined below) in any determination by such accounting firm shall pay its own expenses incurred with respect to the submission to such accounting firm and shall pay a percentage of (A) the fees and expenses of such accounting firm plus (B) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of the other party incurred with respect to the submission, which percentage shall be calculated by dividing (1) an amount equal to the difference between the Non-Prevailing Party's determination of Final Net Assets, as submitted to such accounting firm, and such accounting firm's determination of Final Net Assets by (2) an amount equal to the difference between the parties' respective determinations of Final Net Assets, as submitted to such accounting firm.  The other party shall pay the remainder of the fees and expenses of such accounting firm and its own expenses not required to be paid by the Non-Prevailing Party hereunder.  A party is the "Non-Prevailing Party" if such accounting firm's determination of Final Net Assets is closer to the other party's determination of Final Net Assets, as submitted to such accounting firm, than it is to that party's determination of Final Net Assets, as submitted to such accounting firm.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(b)(xi), if such accounting firm's determination of Final Net Assets does not result in a Purchase Price that is lower than the Purchase Price would have been based upon Sellers' determination of Final Net Assets (after giving effect to Section 4(b)(iv) or 4(b)(v)), Buyer shall pay all of the fees and expenses of such accounting firm plus all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of Sellers incurred with respect to the submission.

Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange
Regulations thereunder (including the Rosedale and Ridgedale Marshall Field's stores pursuant to the separate agreements contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii)) (each, an "Exchange Transaction"); Buyer shall at Seller's sole cost and expense cooperate in an Exchange Transaction arranged by the Company and a qualified exchange intermediary (as such term is used in the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1031 of the Code) designated by the Company.  The Company shall provide written notice to Buyer of the Company's election to participate in an Exchange Transaction no later than 10 days prior to Closing.  Buyer shall not incur any Tax liability, any expenses or any liability of any nature in connection with any Exchange Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take title to any exchange property under any circumstances.  The Company shall indemnify and save and hold harmless Buyer from any and all liabilities arising out of or related to any Exchange Transaction.  Buyer shall, upon the Company's request, execute and deliver such documents and agreements as are reasonably necessary for the purpose of facilitating an Exchange Transaction, and Buyer shall pay the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to the Exchange Assets (the "Escrowed Purchase Price") at the Closing to the Company's designated qualified exchange intermediary.  The Company's right to receive the Escrowed Purchase Price shall be limited as required by Section 1031 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  If a tax-deferred exchange cannot be effected by Seller for any reason other than a breach by Buyer, Sellers shall still be obligated to close this transaction pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  Under no circumstances shall Sellers' right or election to exchange, rather than sell, Assets delay closing, require Buyer to incur any expense it would not have otherwise incurred (unless paid or reimbursed by Sellers as provided above) or otherwise adversely affect Buyer's rights hereunder.  The Escrowed Purchase Price for any Real Estate shall be the same as the amount allocated for such Real Estate as determined under Section 4(f) or Section 4(a)(ii) hereof as applicable.

Buyer will not have liability or obligation, and Sellers shall retain all liability or obligation, of any kind with respect to any similar plan, fund, program, policy, contract or arrangement maintained by any Seller, or by any of its affiliates that is aggregated with such Seller under Code Section 414 or ERISA Section 4001, that is not a Seller's Plan but that would be a Sellers' Plan if it covered Employees.
(iv)
                             
 
Any benefits related to events occurring or expenses incurred after the Cut-Off Date shall be covered by Buyer's Plans to the extent that Buyer's Plans provide benefits to other similarly situated employees of Buyer under such circumstances following the Effective Time.

Buyer or a Buyer's Plan shall assume the liability for all short-term disability benefits payable to any Transferred Employee under Sellers' short-term disability plans that are payable following the Effective Time with respect to any disability that occurred prior to the Effective Time (determined under the terms of Seller's Plans or personnel policy that applies to the disabled Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time) until the date, if any, on which the Transferred Employee qualifies for benefits under the Sellers' long-term disability plans.

If any Transferred Employee is on any form of leave of absence on the Cut-Off Date (including any leave subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act or comparable state law), Buyer shall reinstate such Transferred Employee to active employment as provided in Section 11(a) and otherwise as required by any applicable law or regulation or by Buyer's personnel policies, and shall satisfy any other obligation owed to such Transferred Employee upon expiration of the leave.

Exhibit 99
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, June 9, 2004  Target Corporation announced today that it has reached a definitive agreement to sell its Marshall Field's business unit and nine locations in the Twin Cities currently operated as Mervyn's stores to The May Department Stores Company for approximately $3.2 billion in cash. Marshall Field's is a traditional department store that emphasizes fashion leadership, quality merchandise and superior guest service. It is headquartered in Minneapolis, operates 62 stores and employs approximately 25,000 team members in 8 states in the upper Midwest. In 2003, Marshall Field's produced revenues of $2.6 billion and pretax segment profit of $107 million.
Under the terms of the agreement, Target Corporation will sell substantially all of the assets directly involved in its Marshall Field's business unit, including 62 Marshall Field's stores, three distribution centers and approximately $600 million of Marshall Field's credit card receivables. All current Marshall Field's team members will be offered employment by The May Department Stores Company.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed shortly after approval is obtained. The sale is expected to result in an estimated after-tax gain in the range of $1 billion, somewhat exceeding $1.00 per share, in the second or third quarter.
Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation, said, "Our decision to sell Marshall Field's, though not easy, reflects our long-term commitment to create substantial value for our shareholders over time, combined with our responsibility to our team members, our guests and the communities we serve. We believe that the sale of Marshall Field's to The May Department Store Company as an ongoing business enhances the opportunity for all of our stakeholders to enjoy continued success for many years."
Target Corporation also announced today its plans to repurchase $3 billion of its common stock. The repurchase program was authorized by the company's board of directors and replaces an existing share repurchase authorization. The repurchase of the common stock is expected to be made primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and is expected to be completed within two to three years.
The review of strategic alternatives for Mervyn's is continuing in line with its expected timetable, and additional information regarding this review is expected to be available within 60 to 90 days. Mervyn's is a promotional, middle-market department store, based in the San Francisco Bay area with 266 stores in 14 states, primarily in the west and south. In 2003, Mervyn's generated $3.6 billion in revenue and $160 million in pretax segment profit. Target Corporation announced in March that this review includes, but is not limited to, the possible sale of Mervyn's as an ongoing business to an existing retailer or other qualified buyer. As we reach important milestones in this process, the company will broadly disseminate updates.
A pre-recorded message describing all information that is currently available will be accessible later this evening by calling 612-761-1005. A transcript of this pre-recorded message is also available on our web site at (Click on "investor information," then select "presentations").
