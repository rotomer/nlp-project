As a result of adoption in its second fiscal quarter of definitive plans of disposition for Marshall Field's and Mervyn's, Target Corporation was required to report the financial results of these two segments as discontinued operations for all periods presented beginning with the filing of the second quarter Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 31, 2004.  On September 16, 2004, Target Corporation made available certain financial statements from the following previously filed Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs that report the financial results of Marshall Field's and Mervyn's as discontinued operations: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 3, 2003, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August, 2, 2003, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended November 1, 2003, Form 10-K for the quarterly period and fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 1, 2004 and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 31, 2004.

These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net earnings for any period.
