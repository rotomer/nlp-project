Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 12, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors for Target Corporation (the "Company") approved criteria for performance shares awarded to executives on that same date pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan. Performance shares represent shares of the Company's common stock issuable to recipients of performance share awards upon the attainment of certain performance goals. Fifty percent of the shares ultimately earned, if any are earned, will be based on the Company's compound annual revenue growth and fifty percent will be based on the Company's compound annual earnings per share growth, each for a three year performance period beginning at the start of the Company's 2005 fiscal year. Fiscal 2004 will serve as the baseline performance measurement year.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
