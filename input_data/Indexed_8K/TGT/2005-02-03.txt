MINNEAPOLIS, February 3, 2005  Target Corporation today reported that its net retail sales from continuing operations (principally Target Stores) for the four weeks ended January 29, 2005 increased 13.6 percent to $3.126 billion from $2.751 billion for the four-week period ended January 31, 2004. On this same basis, comparable-store sales increased 9.4 percent from fiscal January 2004.
 
"Our sales for the month of January were above plan," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation.
 
 
A separate release discussing two accounting matters that are expected to impact Target Corporation financial results in fiscal 2004 was also issued today, February 3, 2005.
Forward-looking statements in this release should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Exhibit (99)C to the company's 2003 Form 10-K.
Target Corporation operates Target Stores, a chain of large, general merchandise discount stores consisting of 1,308 locations in 47 states, as well as an on-line business called Target.com.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 Target Corporation today provided background information on two accounting matters which will reduce its earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2004.  Financial results for these periods are expected to be released to the public before the market opens on February 17, 2005.
MINNEAPOLIS, February 3, 2005
 
Accounting for Certain Land Leases
After consultation with its external auditors, Target Corporation will adjust its method of accounting for leases related to a specific category of owned store locations which are located on leased land. The effect will be a $65 million non-cash adjustment, primarily attributable to an increase in Target's year-end straight-line rent accrual, which will increase the Company's pre-tax occupancy costs for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 and will reduce earnings per share by approximately 4 cents. Of the $65 million pre-tax expense to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004, $10 million pre-tax, or less than 1 cent per share, is attributable to the current year and $55 million pre-tax, or approximately 4 cents per share, is related to prior periods. Prior years' financial results will not be restated due to the immateriality of this issue to the results of operations and statement of financial position for the current year or any individual prior year. The adjustment will not affect historical or future cash flows or timing of payments under related leases.
For many years, Target has utilized a 39 year depreciable life for substantially all its store buildings, including its owned stores located on leased land. Separately, in these circumstances, Target used the original term of the land lease, which was often less than 39 years, for calculating its straight-line rent expense. This accounting adjustment results in Target using a time period for its straight-line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation.
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Separately, Target Corporation has decided to early adopt, in the fourth quarter of 2004, SFAS 123R, which modifies SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". This revised accounting standard requires that all stock-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The expected impact of the adoption of this accounting change on Target Corporation 2004 diluted earnings per share is a reduction of 2 to 3 cents, with the expense being incurred in approximately equal quarterly amounts throughout the year. The impact on fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share is expected to be a similar reduction, resulting in an immaterial year-over-year differential.
In the first quarter of 2003, Target adopted SFAS 123 in accordance with the prospective transition method. Under this guidance, the fair-value-based method was applied prospectively to stock awards granted subsequent to February 1, 2003, the last day of our 2002 fiscal year.
Restatements will be included, as appropriate, in Target's 2004 year-end earnings release and 2004 Form 10-K.
Under the revised standard, Target is electing the modified retrospective transition method. As a result, all prior period financial statements are being restated to recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of SFAS 123.
