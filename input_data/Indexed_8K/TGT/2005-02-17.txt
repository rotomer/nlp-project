Exhibit 99
 
 Target Corporation today reported earnings from continuing operations of $809 million, or $0.90 per share, for the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005, compared with $722 million, or $0.79 per share, in the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2004. For the full year, earnings from continuing operations were $1.885 billion, or $2.07 per share, in 2004, compared with $1.619 billion, or $1.76 per share, in 2003. As previously disclosed, fourth quarter and full year 2004 earnings from continuing operations were reduced by $65 million, or $0.04 per share, as a result of an adjustment to the company's lease accounting. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. The attached consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
MINNEAPOLIS, February 17, 2005
 
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $825 million, or $0.91 per share. These results included a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $16 million, or $0.01 per share, related to finalizing the tax attributes of the transaction, in addition to the earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings for the full year were $3.198 billion, or $3.51 per share. In addition to earnings from continuing operations, total year results also included earnings from discontinued operations of $75 million, or $0.08 per share, and a gain of $1.238 billion, or $1.36 per share, related to the sale of Marshall Field's and Mervyn's.
 
"We are pleased with our performance and our many accomplishments during 2004, including our strong growth and continued market share gains at Target and the successful sale of our Mervyn's and Marshall Field's divisions," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "We believe that we remain well-positioned in 2005 and the years beyond to delight our guests, achieve profitable growth and deliver superior value to our shareholders."
 
Analysis of Continuing Operations  Full Year Results
 
Total revenues increased 11.5 percent to $46.839 billion from $42.025 billion in 2003, driven by a 5.3 percent increase in comparable store sales combined with the contribution from new store expansion and our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
 
For the year, earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) increased 14.0 percent to $3.601 billion, compared with $3.159 billion in 2003. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to EBIT was $485 million, an increase of $61 million, or 14.4 percent.

The company's gross margin rate improved from the prior year primarily due to an increase in markup, while the company's expense rate was unfavorable to prior year primarily due to previously disclosed lease accounting adjustments. (Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
 
Net interest expense grew $14 million to $570 million in 2004, including $89 million related to loss on debt repurchase, compared with $556 million in 2003, including $15 million of loss on debt repurchase. The impact of the higher loss on debt repurchase on 2004 interest expense was partially offset by substantially lower average funded balances in the third and fourth quarters resulting from the application of proceeds from the Mervyn's and Marshall Field's sale transactions.
 
Analysis of Continuing Operations  Fourth Quarter Results
 
Fourth quarter revenues were $15.194 billion, up 11.1 percent from $13.676 billion in the same period a year ago. Comparable store sales for the quarter rose 5.4 percent.
 
Fourth quarter earnings before interest and income taxes were $1.409 billion, an increase of $118 million, or 9.1 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
The company's gross margin rate improved slightly from the prior year primarily due to an increase in markup, partially offset by higher markdowns. The company's expense rate was unfavorable to prior year primarily due to previously disclosed lease accounting adjustments, partially offset by expense rate favorability in other areas. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to EBIT was $134 million, an increase of $23 million, or 21.0 percent.
 
Net interest expense decreased $22 million for the quarter. This improvement was due to the benefit of significantly lower average funded balances, reflecting the application of proceeds from the Mervyn's and Marshall Field's sale transactions, partially offset by a higher average portfolio rate.
 
Analysis of Discontinued Operations
 
During 2004, Target Corporation completed the sale of its Mervyn's and Marshall Field's business segments in separate transactions for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately $4.9 billion. As a result of these transactions, the corporation reported a pretax gain of $2.000 billion, or $1.36 per share, for the full year. In addition, the financial results of Marshall Field's and Mervyn's are reported as discontinued operations for both 2004 and 2003.
 
In connection with the sale of Marshall Field's, Target is providing transition support services for a fee to The May Department Stores Company until the end of first quarter 2005. Target is also supplying transition services for a fee, in connection with the sale of Mervyn's, until the earlier of August 2007 or the date on which an alternative long-term solution for providing these services is in place. Consideration received from providing these services is reflected as an offset to expenses incurred.

Other Factors
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, Target adopted SFAS 123R, which requires that all stock-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The impact of adopting this revised accounting guidance, using the modified retrospective transition method, was a reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $7 million, or less than $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter and $38 million, or about $0.03 per share, for the full year. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this accounting change.
 
The company's annual effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 37.8 percent in both 2004 and 2003.
 
In June 2004, the company announced a $3 billion share repurchase program. Under this program, the company repurchased $300 million of its common stock during the fourth quarter, acquiring 6.1 million shares at an average price of $49.51 per share. For the full year, the company has acquired 28.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $44.68, reflecting a total investment of approximately $1.29 billion. The company continues to expect that this share repurchase program will be completed within two to three years of its inception.
