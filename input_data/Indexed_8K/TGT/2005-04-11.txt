We elected to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123R) under the modified retrospective transition method for the year ended January 29, 2005.  SFAS No. 123R eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method.  As such, all prior period financial statements have been restated to recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation." On April 11, 2005, Target Corporation made available certain financial statements from the following previously filed Form 10-Qs to recognize compensation cost under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R:  Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 1, 2004, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 31, 2004 and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 30, 2004. Additionally, certain financial statements from Target Corporation's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 29, 2005, were made available.
