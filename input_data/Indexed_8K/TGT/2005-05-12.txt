Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 Target Corporation today reported earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter ended April 30, 2005 of $494 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $392 million, or 43 cents per share in the first quarter ended May 1, 2004. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
MINNEAPOLIS, May 12, 2005
 
 "We are pleased with our first quarter results," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation.  "Our performance reflects our discipline in executing our strategy and our success in delighting our guests with the right combination of innovation, design and value. We are optimistic about our ability to sustain our competitive advantage and remain confident that we will continue to enjoy profitable market share growth throughout 2005 and beyond."
 
Total revenues in the first quarter increased 12.7 percent to $11.477 billion from $10.180 billion in 2004, driven by a 6.2 percent increase in comparable store sales combined with the contribution from new store expansion and our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
 
For the quarter, earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) increased 17.4 percent to $907 million, compared with $773 million in the first quarter 2004. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to EBIT was $142 million, an increase of $31 million, or 27.9 percent.
 
In the first quarter, the company's gross margin rate improved from the prior year, reflecting favorable markup and shortage performance, while the company's expense rate was unfavorable to prior year.(Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
 
Net interest expense for the quarter decreased $32 million compared with first quarter 2004 reflecting the benefit of lower average funded balances resulting from the application of proceeds from the Mervyn's and Marshall Field's sale transactions, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate.
