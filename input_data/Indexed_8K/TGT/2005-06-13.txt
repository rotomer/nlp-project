Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On June 9, 2005, Target Corporation (the "Corporation") entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent and one of several lending banks, for a $1.6 billion unsecured revolving credit facility.  The new facility will expire in June 2010, and replaces Target's existing $800 million 364-Day Credit Agreement and $800 million Five-Year Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the new facility bear interest at the rates specified in the agreement, and the agreement contains one financial covenant (leverage ratio).  A copy of the agreement will be filed as an Exhibit to Target's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 30, 2005.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
