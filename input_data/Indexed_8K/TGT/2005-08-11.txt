On August 11, 2005, Target Corporation issued a News Release containing its financial results for the quarter ended July 30, 2005.  The News Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. Forward-looking statements in this release should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Exhibit (99)C attached to Target Corporation's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2005.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 Target Corporation today reported earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter ended July 30, 2005 of $540 million, or 61 cents per share, compared with $360 million, or 39 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, 2004. Prior year results from continuing operations include a loss of $74 million, or 5 cents per share, from early retirement of debt. Second quarter 2004 earnings per share of $1.53 also included 3 cents per share from discontinued operations and $1.11 per share from the gain on disposal of discontinued operations. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
MINNEAPOLIS, August 11, 2005
 
"We are very pleased with our second quarter results," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation.  "Our performance reflects our strategic discipline, consistent execution, and ability to delight Target's guests with the right combination of innovation, design and value. As a result of our momentum and team members' continuing dedication, we believe that Target is well-positioned to enjoy profitable market share growth for the remainder of 2005."
 
Continuing Operations
 
Total revenues in the second quarter increased 13.6 percent to $11.990 billion from $10.556 billion in 2004, driven by a 6.7 percent increase in comparable store sales combined with the contribution from new store expansion and our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
 
For the quarter, earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) increased 24.6 percent to $979 million, compared with $786 million in the second quarter 2004. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to EBIT was $153 million, an increase of $33 million, or 27.5 percent.
 
In the second quarter, the company's gross margin rate improved from the prior year, primarily due to higher markup. Favorability in markdowns and inventory shortage also contributed to the improvement. The company's expense rate was unfavorable to prior year. (Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
 
Net interest expense for the quarter decreased $97 million compared with second quarter 2004. Of this year-over-year improvement, $74 million is attributable to a loss on debt repurchase in the second quarter of 2004 and the remaining $23 million reflects lower average funded balances in the current year, resulting from the application of proceeds from the Mervyn's and Marshall Field's sale transactions, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate.
 
Other Factors
 
The company's effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.9 percent in 2005 compared with 37.8 percent in 2004.
 
In June 2004, the company announced a $3 billion share repurchase program. Under this program, the company repurchased $80 million of its common stock during the second quarter of 2005, acquiring 1.7 million shares at an average price of $47.42 per share. Program to-date, the company has acquired 39.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $45.95, reflecting a total investment of approximately $1.81 billion. The company continues to expect that this share repurchase program will be completed within two to three years of its inception.
