Item 8.01
                                          
Other Events
 
As a result of its adoption in the second fiscal quarter of 2004 of definitive plans for the disposition of its Marshall Field's and Mervyn's business units, Target Corporation (the Company) was required to report the financial results of those two segments as discontinued operations for all periods after its first quarter ended May 1, 2004.
 
In addition, the Company elected to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123R) under the modified retrospective transition method for the year ended January 29, 2005.  SFAS No. 123R eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method.  Accordingly, all prior period financial statements have been restated to recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation."
 
To provide historical perspective for comparative purposes, the Company is providing certain financial statements from the following previously filed Form 10-Qs to present results from continuing operations only and to recognize compensation cost under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R: Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 4, 2002, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended August 3, 2002 and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended November 2, 2002.  Additionally, certain financial statements from the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending February 1, 2003 are also included.
