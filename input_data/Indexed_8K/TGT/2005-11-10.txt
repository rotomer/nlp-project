On November 10, 2005, Target Corporation issued a News Release containing its financial results for the quarter ended October 29, 2005.  The News Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. Forward-looking statements in this release should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Exhibit (99)C attached to Target Corporation's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 30, 2005.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 Target Corporation today reported earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter ended October 29, 2005 of $435 million, or 49 cents per share, compared with $324 million, or 36 cents per share, in the third quarter ended October 30, 2004. Including 23 cents per share from the combination of earnings from discontinued operations and gain on disposal of discontinued operations, third quarter 2004 earnings per share totaled 59 cents per share. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
MINNEAPOLIS, November 10, 2005
 
"As our robust third quarter performance developed over the past several months, we have expressed growing confidence in Target's ability to deliver diluted EPS of $1.50, or more, in the second half of this year," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation.  "Our strategic discipline, consistent execution, and commitment to delight Target's guests with the right combination of innovation, design and value reinforce our belief that we will continue to grow market share profitably in this year's fourth quarter and well beyond. Specifically, our outlook envisions that, beginning in this year's fourth quarter, we are likely to achieve a more typical mid-teen percentage growth in EPS, consistent with our long-term growth objectives."
 
For reference, the company earned 90 cents per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Continuing Operations
 
Total revenues in the third quarter increased 11.9 percent to $12.206 billion from $10.909 billion in 2004, driven by a 5.9 percent increase in comparable store sales combined with the contribution from new store expansion and our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
 
For the quarter, earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) increased 31.2 percent to $831 million, compared with $633 million in the third quarter 2004. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to EBIT was $158 million, an increase of $38 million, or 31.3 percent. (Contribution from credit card operations includes the aggregate of finance charge revenue, late fees, other revenue, intracompany and third party merchant fees less bad debt provision and operations and marketing expense.)
 
In the third quarter, the company's gross margin rate improved sharply from the prior year, primarily due to higher markup. Favorability in markdowns and inventory shrink also contributed to the improvement. The company's expense rate was unfavorable to prior year due to the net effects of three hurricanes and several other unfavorable factors, partially offset by the benefit of the previously-disclosed Visa/MasterCard settlement and several other favorable factors. (Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $5 million compared with third quarter 2004. This increase reflects higher average funded balances, partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate in the current year.
 
Other Factors
 
During the third quarter, the company adjusted its year-to-date 2005 effective income tax rate for continuing operations to approximately 38.2 percent, which resulted in a third quarter income tax rate of about 39.0 percent. The effective income tax rate in 2004 was 37.8 percent for both the year-to-date and third quarter periods.
 
In June 2004, the company announced a $3 billion share repurchase program. Under this program, the company repurchased $365 million of its common stock during the third quarter of 2005, acquiring 6.7 million shares at an average price of $54.36 per share. Program to-date, the company has acquired 46.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $47.18, reflecting a total investment of approximately $2.17 billion.
 
Target Corporation also announced today that its Board has increased its current $3 billion share repurchase authorization by $2 billion, for a total authorization of $5 billion. The company expects to continue to execute this program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and expects to complete the aggregate $5 billion program in approximately two to three years.
