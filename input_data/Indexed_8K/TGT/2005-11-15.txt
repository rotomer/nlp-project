On November 9, 2005, the Board of Directors of Target Corporation approved certain changes in the compensation program for non-employee directors, to take effect beginning January 1, 2006.  The director compensation program, as amended, will provide non-employee directors with a choice of one of three forms for receiving his or her annual compensation, as follows:

Grant of stock options having a face value of $200,000 on the date of grant.  All options are granted at fair market value as of the grant date, which will occur in January of each year; and
 - 
                 
Grant of restricted stock units (RSUs) with a face value of $65,000.  RSUs will generally vest over a three year period and will be settled in shares of Target common stock after the director's departure from the Board.  RSUs will be granted in June of each year.

In addition to the annual compensation described above, newly-elected directors will receive a one-time award of RSUs with a face value of $50,000 upon joining the Board.
 
The chairpersons of the Audit and Compensation Committees will receive additional annual compensation of $25,000 and $15,000, respectively, and the Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee will receive an additional $10,000.
