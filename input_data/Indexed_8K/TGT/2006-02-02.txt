MINNEAPOLIS, February 2, 2006  Target Corporation today reported that its net retail sales from continuing operations (principally Target Stores) for the four weeks ended January 28, 2006 increased 14.1 percent to $3.566 billion from $3.126 billion for the four-week period ended January 29, 2005. On this same basis, comparable-store sales increased 5.2 percent from fiscal January 2005.
 
"Target's comparable store sales were at the upper end of our planned range for the month of January, culminating a year of strong sales growth," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "We are pleased with our 2005 performance and optimistic that we will continue to deliver profitable market share gains throughout 2006."
 
 
Separately, beginning in February 2006, we are revising our practice of weekly sales disclosures. Going forward, we will provide a sales recording on the day of our monthly sales release and one mid-month sales update. Our mid-month sales recordings will be issued after the market closes on the Monday following the end of week 2 in months that have four accounting weeks, and on the Monday following the end of week 3 in months that have five accounting weeks. Consistent with this new practice, our next sales recording is planned for Monday, February 13, 2006. The phone number for the recorded message remains unchanged at 612-761-6500.
