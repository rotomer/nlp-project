Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 Target Corporation today reported earnings from continuing operations of $939 million, or $1.06 per share, for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006, compared with $809 million, or $0.90 per share, in the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005. For the full year, earnings from continuing operations were $2.408 billion, or $2.71 per share, in 2005, compared with $1.885 billion, or $2.07 per share, in 2004. Including earnings from discontinued operations and the gain on disposal of discontinued operations, earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 were 91 cents and $3.51, respectively. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. The attached consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
MINNEAPOLIS, February 16, 2006
 
"Target produced outstanding results in 2005, surpassing $50 billion in sales and generating strong growth in earnings," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "We are proud of our recent performance, remain committed to our strategic direction and believe that Target is well-positioned to continue delighting our guests and delivering superior value to our shareholders in 2006 and for years beyond."
 
Analysis of Continuing Operations  Full Year Results
 
Total revenues increased 12.3 percent to $52.620 billion from $46.839 billion in 2004, driven by a 5.6 percent increase in comparable store sales combined with the contribution from new store expansion and our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
 
For the year, earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) increased 20.1 percent to $4.323 billion, compared with $3.601 billion in 2004. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to EBIT was $645 million, an increase of $160 million, or 32.8 percent driven by strong underlying portfolio performance and the effect of rising interest rates on finance charge revenue. In total, 2005 EBIT increased to 8.2 percent of revenues from 7.7 percent of revenues in 2004 due to expansion of the company's gross margin rate and the increased contribution to EBIT from the company's credit card operations, partially offset by unfavorable expense rate performance.
 
These expense rate factors more than offset the current year favorability from last year's lease accounting adjustment. (Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
The company's gross margin rate expansion resulted from improvements in markup and inventory shrinkage, while the unfavorability in the company's expense rate was due to several factors including lower transition services income from discontinued operations and higher utilities expense.
 
Net interest expense decreased $107 million to $463 million in 2005, compared with $570 million in 2004. This expense favorability in 2005 is attributable to a significantly lower loss on debt repurchase and lower average funded balances, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate. Net interest expense in 2004 included $89 million of loss on debt repurchase.
 
Analysis of Continuing Operations  Fourth Quarter Results
 
Fourth quarter revenues were $16.947 billion, up 11.5 percent from $15.194 billion in the same period a year ago. Comparable store sales for the quarter rose 4.2 percent.
 
The contribution from the company's credit card operations to EBIT was $192 million, an increase of $58 million, or 43.1 percent.
Fourth quarter earnings before interest and income taxes were $1.606 billion, an increase of $197 million, or 14.0 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
The company's gross margin rate improved slightly from the prior year, while our expense rate performance was unfavorable due to several factors including lower transition services income from discontinued operations and a planned retiming of advertising expense from earlier in the year. These factors more than offset the current year favorability from last year's lease accounting adjustment.
 
Net interest expense increased $17 million for the quarter. This unfavorability was due to higher average funded balances, partially offset by a lower average portfolio rate.
 
Other Factors
 
The company's 2005 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 37.6 percent, which resulted in a fourth quarter income tax rate of about 36.6 percent. The effective income tax rate in 2004 was 37.8 percent for both the full year and fourth quarter periods.
 
In June 2004, the company announced a $3 billion share repurchase program and in November 2005, the Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $2 billion to an aggregate $5 billion program. Under this program, the company repurchased $300 million of its common stock during the fourth quarter of 2005, acquiring 5.5 million shares at an average price of $54.41 per share. For the full year, the company invested $1.2 billion, repurchasing 23.1 million shares at an average price of $51.88, and program to-date, the company has acquired 51.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $47.95, reflecting a total investment of approximately $2.5 billion.
The company expects to continue to execute this program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and expects to complete the total program in approximately two to three years.
