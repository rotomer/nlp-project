Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On March 8, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Target Corporation ("Target") approved the following performance measures for purposes of determining potential short-term incentive payments to its executive officers pursuant to Target's Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan ("STIP") for fiscal 2006:  earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") and economic value added ("EVA"). For executives other than the CEO, incentive payments will be based on Target's achievement of performance goals under these measures for the fiscal year and the executive's personal score. The CEO's bonus under the STIP will be determined solely by Target's achievement of performance goals. The CEO's personal performance bonus will be determined at the discretion of the independent members of the Board of Directors. The incentive payout for executive officers attributable to Target's financial performance will be based upon equal weightings of EBIT goals and EVA goals. All payments under the STIP are subject to the limitations provided in the STIP.
