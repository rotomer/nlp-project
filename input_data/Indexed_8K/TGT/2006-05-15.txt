On May 15, 2006, Target Corporation issued a News Release containing its financial results for the quarter ended April 29, 2006.  The News Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. Forward-looking statements in this release should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Exhibit (99)C to Target Corporation's 2005 Form 10-K.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
-- Target Corporation today reported net earnings for the first quarter ended April 29, 2006 of $554 million, or 63 cents per share, compared with $494 million, or 55 cents per share in the first quarter ended April 30, 2005. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
MINNEAPOLIS, May 15, 2006
"We are pleased with our first quarter results," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation, "and believe they reflect our continued success in delighting our guests with the right combination of innovation, design and value. Our performance underlies our confidence that we will continue to generate profitable market share growth and reinforces our belief in our ability to achieve a mid-teen percentage increase in EPS for the full year 2006."
Total revenues in the first quarter increased 12.1 percent to $12.863 billion from $11.477 billion in 2005, driven by a 5.1 percent increase in comparable store sales combined with the contribution from new store expansion and our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit card revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) in the first quarter of 2006 increased 12.2 percent, in line with revenue growth, to $1.017 billion, compared with $907 million in the first quarter a year ago. Key contributors to this EBIT growth included more rapid profit growth in our credit card operations and the benefit of a non-recurring $28 million pre-tax adjustment to depreciation and amortization, partially offset by unfavorable expense rate performance. The company's gross margin rate was also slightly unfavorable to the prior year. (Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $20 million compared with first quarter 2005 primarily due to higher average debt balances.
The contribution from the company's credit card operations to first quarter earnings before taxes (EBT), net of the allocated interest expense to fund our average accounts receivable, was $162 million, an increase of $60 million, or 59.5 percent, from the same period in 2005. This favorability is attributable to strong growth in net interest income and the near-term benefit to our bad debt expense of the 2005 federal bankruptcy legislation.

Other Factors
The company's effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 37.5 percent in 2006 compared with 37.9 percent in 2005. For the full year, the effective income tax rate is expected to be between 38.0 and 38.5 percent.
In June 2004, the company announced a $3 billion share repurchase program, and in November 2005, the Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $2 billion to an aggregate $5 billion program. Under this program, the company repurchased $350 million of its common stock during the first quarter of 2006, acquiring 6.6 million shares at an average price of $53.11 per share. Program to-date, the company has acquired 58.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $48.54, reflecting a total investment of approximately $2.82 billion.
The company expects to continue to execute this program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and expects to complete the total program by year-end 2008, or sooner.
