Forward-looking statements in this release should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Exhibit (99)C to Target Corporation's 2005 Form 10-K.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 Target Corporation today reported net earnings for the second quarter ended July 29, 2006 of $609 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $540 million, or 61 cents per share in the second quarter ended July 30, 2005. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
MINNEAPOLIS, August 10, 2006
 
"We are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "We continue to believe Target will deliver strong sales and profit performance in 2006 and generate another year of profitable market share growth even in light of the challenges posed by the current economic environment."
 
Total revenues in the second quarter increased 11.3 percent to $13.347 billion from $11.990 billion in 2005, driven by the contribution from new store expansion, a 4.6 percent increase in comparable store sales and the contribution of our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit card revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
 
Earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) in the second quarter of 2006 increased 15.9 percent to $1.134 billion, compared with $979 million in the second quarter a year ago. Both our core retail operations and our credit card operations contributed significantly to this EBIT growth. Within our retail operations, gross margin rate was essentially unchanged from an exceptional prior year level, while the company's expense rate in the quarter was somewhat unfavorable to the prior year. (Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $30 million compared with second quarter 2005, primarily due to higher average debt balances, and to a lesser extent, due to a higher average portfolio rate.
 
Earnings before taxes (EBT) in the second quarter totaled $994 million, representing an increase of $125 million, or 14.5 percent, from the same period in 2005. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to these results was $168 million, an increase of $58 million, or 52.7 percent, from a year ago.
 
 
Other Factors
 
The company's effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 38.8 percent in 2006 compared with 37.9 percent in 2005. For the full year, the effective income tax rate is now expected to be between 38.3 and 38.8 percent.
 
The company has Board authorization to repurchase $5 billion of its common stock. Under this program, the company repurchased $550 million of its common stock during the second quarter of 2006, acquiring 11.3 million shares at an average price of $48.63 per share. Program to-date, the company has acquired 69.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $48.55, reflecting a total investment of approximately $3.37 billion.
The company expects to continue to execute this program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and expects to complete the total program by year-end 2008, or sooner.
