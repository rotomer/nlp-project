Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today reported net earnings for the third quarter ended October 28, 2006 of $506 million, or 59 cents per share, compared with $435 million, or 49 cents per share in the third quarter ended October 29, 2005. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
MINNEAPOLIS, November 14, 2006
 
"We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "We continue to believe that our strategic discipline, consistent execution, and commitment to deliver the right combination of innovation, design and value will delight our guests and produce profitable market share growth in this year's fourth quarter and well beyond."
 
Total revenues in the third quarter increased 11.2 percent to $13.570 billion from $12.206 billion in 2005, driven by the contribution from new store expansion, a 4.6 percent increase in comparable store sales and the contribution from our credit card operations. (Total revenues include retail sales and net credit card revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.)
 
Earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) in the third quarter of 2006 increased 15.0 percent to $957 million, compared with $831 million in the third quarter a year ago. Both our core retail operations and our credit card operations contributed to this EBIT growth. Within our core retail operations, gross margin rate was slightly favorable to the prior year, while the company's expense rate in the quarter was unfavorable to the prior year. (Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.)
 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $31 million compared with third quarter 2005, primarily due to growth in the cost of funding our credit card operations.
 
Earnings before taxes (EBT) in the third quarter totaled $808 million, representing an increase of $95 million, or 13.2 percent, from the same period in 2005. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to these results was $176 million, an increase of $68 million, or 62.9 percent, from a year ago.
 
 
Other Factors
 
The company's effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 37.4 percent in 2006 compared with 39.0 percent in 2005. For the full year, the effective income tax rate is now expected to be between 37.9 and 38.4 percent.
 
The company repurchased $59 million of its common stock during the third quarter of 2006, acquiring 1.2 million shares at an average price of $48.86 per share, under a $5 billion program which began in 2004. Program to-date, the company has acquired 70.7 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $48.56, reflecting a total investment of approximately $3.43 billion.
The company expects to continue to execute this program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and expects to complete the total program by year-end 2008, or sooner.
