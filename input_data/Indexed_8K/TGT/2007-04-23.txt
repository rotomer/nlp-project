On April 23, 2007, Target Corporation placed the following pre-recorded message on its sales information line:
 for the week ended Saturday April 21, 2007.
Hello, thank you for calling the Target Corporation Sales Information line. The comments on this recording were updated as of Monday April 23
rd
These comments summarize our sales results and outlook at Target Stores for the four-week period extending from Sunday April 8th through Saturday May 5, 2007.
For the March/April period combined, we now expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 3 to 4 percent, slightly below our previous 4 to 6 percent outlook, and we expect comparable store sales for the first quarter to increase about 4 percent. We remain comfortable that our first quarter earnings per share growth will be consistent with our previous guidance for the full year.
Based on actual sales for the first two weeks of April combined with our outlook for the remaining two weeks of the month, we now expect comparable store sales for the full month to be much weaker than our initial plan of -2 to -4 percent.
We expect to report actual sales for the month of April on Thursday, May 10, 2007.
Forward-looking statements in this recording should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Exhibit (99) A to the company's 2006 Form 10-K.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
