On December 24, 2007, Target Corporation placed the following pre-recorded message on its sales information line:
 
Hello, thank you for calling the Target Corporation Sales Information line. The comments on this recording were updated as of Monday, December 24
th
 and summarize our sales results and outlook at Target Stores for the five-week period extending from Sunday December 2
nd
, 2007 through Saturday January 5
th
, 2008.
 
Based on actual sales at Target Stores for the first three weeks of December  combined with our outlook for the remaining two weeks of the month, we now expect calendar - adjusted comparable store sales for the month of December to lie in the range of minus 1 to plus 1 percent. While this outlook reflects an increase in traffic at the end of the third week, this increase was not sufficient to compensate for the unfavorable traffic trends that carried over into December from the week following Thanksgiving.
 
For reference, prior guidance indicated that December calendar - adjusted sales were expected to increase in the range of 3 to 5 percent, and Bob Ulrich, Chairman and CEO of Target Corporation, stated in our December 6
th
 sales release that Our updated expectation indicates that December sales are likely to fall well short of the meaningful improvement Mr. Ulrich described at the end of November.
"sales trends would need to meaningfully improve in December in order to achieve fourth quarter EPS growth."
 
We plan to report actual sales for the month of December on Thursday, January 10
th
 2008.
 
Forward-looking statements in this recording should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements in Exhibit (99) A to the company's 2006 Form 10-K.
 
SIGNATURE
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
