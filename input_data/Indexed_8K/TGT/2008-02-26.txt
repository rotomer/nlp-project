Exhibit (99)
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS, February 26, 2008
 Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported net earnings of $1,028 million for the fourth quarter ended February 2, 2008, a thirteen-week period, compared with $1,119 million in the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007, a fourteen-week period. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased 4.7 percent to $1.23 from $1.29 in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
For the full fiscal year 2007, a 52-week period, net earnings were $2.849 billion, compared with $2.787 billion in fiscal 2006, a 53-week period. Earnings per share increased 3.9 percent to $3.33 from $3.21 a year ago.
"
Our financial performance in 2007 fell short of our expectations as the pace of sales and earnings slowed considerably in the second half of the year
," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer. "As we enter 2008, we remain keenly focused on the disciplined execution of our core strategy, positioning Target to deliver improved financial results, even in the face of continued challenges in the current economic environment."
 
Full-Year Results
For fiscal 2007, total revenues increased 6.5 percent to $63.367 billion from $59.490 billion in 2006, fueled by the contribution from new store expansion, a 3.0 percent increase in comparable store sales, and contribution from credit card operations, offset by the impact of an extra fiscal week in 2006. On a 52-week over 52-week basis, total revenues in 2007 increased 8.4 percent. Total revenues include retail sales and net credit card revenues. Comparable-store sales are sales from stores open longer than one year.
Earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the full year increased 4.0 percent to $5.272 billion, compared with $5.069 billion a year ago. EBIT in core retail operations grew 1.3 percent, while the contribution from credit card operations to total EBIT rose 18.9 percent. Within core retail operations, both gross margin rate and expense rate were slightly unfavorable to the prior year. Gross margin rate represents sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales. Expense rate represents selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of sales.

Earnings before taxes (EBT) for the full year totaled $4.625 billion, an increase of $128 million, or 2.8 percent over 2006. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to full year earnings before taxes, net of the allocated interest expense, was $600 million, an increase of $103 million, or 20.8 percent, over fiscal 2006. Credit card EBT performance was driven by strong growth in average receivables, combined with a moderate increase in the yield on those receivables.
Net interest expense for the year increased $75 million compared with 2006, due to higher average debt balances, including the debt to fund growth in accounts receivable.
The company's annual effective income tax rate was 38.4 percent in 2007 compared with 38.0 percent in 2006.
 
Fourth-Quarter Results
Total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 0.8 percent to $19.872 billion from $19.710 billion in 2006, due to the contribution from new store expansion, a 0.2 percent increase in comparable store sales, and contribution from credit card operations, offset by the impact of an extra fiscal week in 2006. On a 13-week over 13-week basis, total revenues in fourth-quarter 2007 increased 6.3 percent.
Fourth quarter 2007 EBIT decreased 5.8 percent to $1.846 billion from $1.960 billion in the fourth quarter a year ago. EBIT in core retail operations fell 7.6 percent, while the contribution from credit card operations to total EBIT rose 9.0 percent over last year's 14-week quarter. Within core retail operations, gross margin rate was unfavorable to the prior year while expense rate was essentially unchanged from a year ago.
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $30 million over fourth quarter 2006, due to higher average debt balances offset by the cost of funding an extra week in fourth quarter 2006.
EBT in the fourth quarter totaled $1.665 billion, representing a decrease of $144 million, or 7.9 percent, from the same period in 2006. The contribution from the company's credit card operations to these results was $137 million, an increase of $15 million, or 12.0 percent, from a year ago.

Other Factors
In the fourth quarter, under the share repurchase program announced in November 2007, the company repurchased approximately 26.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $54.64, for a total investment of $1.45 billion. For the full year, the company repurchased approximately 46.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $57.24, for a total investment of $2.64 billion.
In addition to its open market share repurchase activity, the company also invested $331 million in a related series of derivative transactions during the quarter involving the purchase and sale of call options on its common stock. These options expire in April, May and June, 2008, and give the company the right to purchase up to 30 million shares of its common stock at various prices. "These call options allowed Target to enjoy the economic benefits of controlling the additional repurchase of nearly 4 percent of our outstanding shares at a time when, prior to our January issuance of $4 billion in long-term debt, our share price presented a compelling opportunity," said Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer.
