Exhibit 99
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS, November 17, 2008
 Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported net earnings of $369 million for the third quarter ended November 1, 2008, compared with $483 million in the third quarter ended November 3, 2007. Earnings per share in the third quarter decreased 13.8 percent to 49 cents from 56 cents in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
"Our third quarter financial results reflect the significant macroeconomic challenges facing our retail and credit card segments," said Gregg Steinhafel, president and chief executive officer. "As we look to this holiday season and 2009, our entire Target organization is focused on providing compelling reasons for our guests to shop at Target in these difficult times  by delivering exceptional value, a broad assortment of outstanding merchandise and a superior store experience. In addition, we continue to drive profitable performance through our thoughtful approach to managing inventory, credit card receivables, expenses and capital investment."
 
Retail Segment Results
Sales grew 1.7 percent in the third quarter 2008 to $14.6 billion from $14.3 billion in 2007, due to the contribution from new store expansion offset by a 3.3 percent decline in comparable store sales. Retail segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $772 million in the third quarter of 2008, up 7.9 percent from $715 million in 2007.
Third quarter gross margin rate increased moderately from last year, driven by increases in gross margin rates within categories, partially offset by the mix impact of faster sales growth in lower margin rate categories. Third quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate was flat to 2007, benefiting from continued productivity gains in stores and disciplined control of expenses across the company.
 
Credit Card Segment Results
Average receivables in the third quarter increased 19.4 percent to $8.7 billion from $7.3 billion in 2007. Average receivables directly funded by Target declined 27 percent in the third quarter to $3.3 billion from $4.5 billion in 2007, reflecting JPMorgan Chase's investment in the receivables portfolio.
Segment profitability in the quarter declined 83 percent to $35 million from $202 million last year, as a result of a decline in overall portfolio performance, Target's reduced investment in the portfolio, and a decrease in interest rates. Overall portfolio performance declined due to higher bad debt expense resulting from current period write-offs and additions to the reserve for future periods.
Third quarter segment pre-tax return on invested capital declined to 4.3 percent in 2008 from 18.0 percent in 2007.

Interest Expense and Taxes
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $58 million from third quarter 2007, due to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by lower average net interest rates. Over the past four quarters, the company has invested $3.8 billion in capital expenditures, $4.8 billion in share repurchase and grown its accounts receivable by $1.1 billion.
The company's effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 41.7 percent in 2008, up from 38.1 percent in 2007. For the full year, the company now expects an effective income tax rate in the range of 38.0 to 38.5 percent.
 
Capital Spending and Share Repurchase
In the third quarter, under the share repurchase program announced in November 2007, the company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $54.93, for a total investment of $140 million.
Program-to-date through the end of the third quarter, the company has acquired approximately 93.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $51.70, reflecting a total investment of approximately $4.8 billion.
"On an ongoing basis we evaluate our deployment of capital resources, both for investment in our business and execution of our share repurchase program," said Doug Scovanner, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "The current environment and our financial outlook have naturally reduced our appetite for investment in our business, and we have also temporarily suspended substantially all of our share repurchase activity. At this time, we have reduced our expected 2009 capital expenditures by about $1 billion. Overall, we believe these related decisions will help to protect our liquidity and strong debt ratings as we continue to operate in a very challenging retail and credit environment."
