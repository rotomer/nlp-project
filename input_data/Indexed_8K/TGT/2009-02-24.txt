 Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported net earnings of $609 million for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2009, compared with $1,028 million in the fourth quarter ended February 2, 2008. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased 34.4 percent to 81 cents from $1.23 in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
MINNEAPOLIS, February 24, 2009
 "Our financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year reflect the impact of unprecedented economic conditions on both of our business segments," said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In 2009, we are focused on continuing to grow our market share profitably - offering even more compelling prices on quality products in combination with a superior shopping experience. At the same time, we will continue to be thoughtful in our deployment of capital, ensuring that we preserve liquidity and make prudent investment decisions to create long-term shareholder value. We believe this will position Target to emerge as an even stronger retail leader when the consumer environment improves."
 
Retail Segment Results
Sales declined 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter 2008 to $19.0 billion from $19.3 billion in 2007, due to a 5.9 percent decline in comparable store sales, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Retail segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $1,251 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, down 22.9 percent from $1,622 million in 2007.
Fourth quarter gross margin rate decreased 1.4 percentage points, driven by increases in markdowns combined with the mix impact of faster sales growth in non-discretionary, lower margin-rate categories. The company reduced its fourth quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense by $27 million from fourth quarter 2007, even in light of the previously announced impact of the January 2009 workforce reduction, and the cost of operating 91 more stores by year-end 2008 compared with a year ago. The company's success in controlling expenses has been driven by continued productivity gains in stores combined with disciplined and thoughtful control across the company.
For fiscal 2008, sales increased 2.3 percent to $62.9 billion from $61.5 billion in 2007, due to the contribution from new stores, partially offset by a 2.9 percent decline in comparable store sales. Full year retail segment EBIT declined 6.0 percent to $4.1 billion in 2008 from $4.3 billion in 2007.
Gross margin rate for fiscal 2008 decreased 0.4 percentage points, as the impact of sales mix was partially offset by rate improvements within categories. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate for the fiscal year was flat to 2007, reflecting strong expense control throughout the year in the face of very soft sales trends.

Credit Card Segment Results
Average receivables in the fourth quarter increased 9.6 percent to $9.1 billion in 2008 from $8.3 billion in 2007. Average receivables directly funded by Target declined 36.2 percent in the fourth quarter to $3.6 billion from $5.6 billion in 2007, reflecting JPMorgan Chase's investment in the receivables portfolio.
The credit card segment incurred a $135 million pre-tax loss in the quarter, compared with a $189 million profit in fourth quarter 2007. This loss was the result of a $245 million addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the quarter. Segment pre-tax return on invested capital was negative 15.0 percent in the fourth quarter 2008, compared with 13.4 percent in 2007.
Average receivables for fiscal 2008 increased 19.5 percent to $8.7 billion from $7.3 billion in 2007, as the company annualized the impact of strong receivables growth that occurred in the third quarter of 2007. Average receivables directly funded by Target in 2008 declined 14.2 percent to $4.2 billion from $4.9 billion in 2007.
Full year 2008 segment profit declined 80.5 percent to $155 million from $797 million in 2007. The company added $440 million to the allowance for doubtful accounts in 2008. Full year pre-tax return on the capital invested by Target in this segment was 3.7 percent in 2008, down from 16.3 percent in 2007.
 
Interest Expense and Taxes
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $34 million from fourth quarter 2007, and full-year interest expense increased $219 million over 2007. Increases in interest expense for both the quarter and the year reflect higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by lower average net interest rates. Over the past four quarters, the company has invested $3.5 billion in capital expenditures, repurchased shares valued at $3.4 billion and grown its gross accounts receivable by $0.5 billion.
The company's annualized effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35.4 percent in 2008, down from 38.3 percent in 2007, due to effective settlement of tax uncertainties during the quarter. For the full year, the effective income tax rate was 37.4, down from 38.4 percent in 2007.
