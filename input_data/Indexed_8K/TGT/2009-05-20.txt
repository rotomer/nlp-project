Exhibit 99
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS, May 20, 2009
 Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported net earnings of $522 million for the first quarter ended May 2, 2009, compared with $602 million in the first quarter ended May 3, 2008. Earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 6.8 percent to $0.69 from $0.74 in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
"Our first quarter earnings per share reflect disciplined execution of our strategy in a difficult environment," said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In our retail segment, we continue to experience strong positive comparable store sales results in our traffic-driving food and commodity categories, and the profitability of our first quarter sales was higher than expected due to outstanding gross margin and expense rate performance. Credit card segment results for the first quarter were stable, profitable and consistent with our expectations. Very importantly, we believe this improved stability and predictability in key aspects of both our retail and credit card segments reflects the resilience of our strategy and underscores our ability to generate substantial value for our shareholders over time."
 
Retail Segment Results
Sales increased 0.4 percent in the first quarter to $14.4 billion in 2009 from $14.3 billion in 2008, due to the contribution from new store expansion partially offset by a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales. Retail segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $962 million in the first quarter of 2009, a 0.3 percent increase from $959 million in 2008.
First quarter gross margin rate was unchanged from prior year, due to favorable markup and markdown performance offset by the unfavorable mix impact of faster sales growth in non-discretionary lower margin rate categories. First quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate improved compared with the first quarter of 2008, benefiting from well-controlled dollar growth in a continued soft sales environment and timing of recognition of certain expenses.
 
Credit Card Segment Results
Average credit card receivables in the quarter increased $249 million, or 3.0 percent, from the first quarter of 2008, and quarter-end receivables increased $37 million, or 0.4 percent, from the same period a year ago.
Credit card segment profit in the quarter declined to $39 million from $181 million last year as a result of a decline in the spread to LIBOR earned on the overall portfolio, and as a result of other factors, including a 49 percent reduction in Target's investment in this segment's average receivables.
As expected, net write-offs in the quarter were $301 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,005 million at quarter-end, reflecting a $5 million reduction during the period.

Interest Expense and Income Taxes
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $1 million from first quarter 2008 to $202 million, reflecting higher average debt balances offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate.
The company's effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 36.7 percent in 2009, down from 37.1 percent in 2008, primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings that are not subject to tax and a decrease in the amount of reserves recorded for tax uncertainties. For the full year, the company now expects an effective income tax rate in the range of 37.0 to 38.0 percent.
