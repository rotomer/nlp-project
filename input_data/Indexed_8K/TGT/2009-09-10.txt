Item 5.03.             
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On September 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Target Corporation approved the amendment and restatement of the company's Bylaws.  The amended and restated Bylaws are attached hereto as Exhibit (3)B.
 
The amendments to the Bylaws implement changes that modernize the Bylaws to enable Target to take advantage of the flexibility permitted under the revised Minnesota corporation statutes, and add the provision regarding advance notice of director nominations described below.
 
The Bylaws add an advance notice requirement for shareholder nominations of director candidates, which increases the 60-day advance notice requirement currently in the Articles of Incorporation to 90 days and requires additional information regarding the proponent's economic interests in Target, including interests in derivative securities.  This advance notice Bylaw provision will not be effective until Target's shareholders approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that would eliminate the advance notice provisions in the Articles of Incorporation.  Target's Board of Directors intends to seek shareholder approval of the amendments to the Articles of Incorporation at the 2010 annual shareholders' meeting.  If those amendments are approved by shareholders, the new advance notice Bylaw provision would be effective for the 2011 annual shareholders' meeting.
 
Other changes to the Bylaws, which are effective as of September 9, 2009, include removing the requirement that the annual meeting of shareholders be held in May of each year, updating the provisions governing board committees, clarifying that the role of Chairman of the Board is not itself an officer position, updating descriptions of officer duties and authority, and other miscellaneous changes that reflect current statutory provisions (including the permitted use of electronic communications and uncertificated shares).

Exhibit (3)B
Section 1.01.  Place of Meetings and Annual Meeting
 
Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation or at such other place or places as the Board may from time to time designate. The regular annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held on such day each year as shall be designated by the Board, and at such time as the Board may from time to time designate, for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other business as may lawfully come before such meeting.
 
Section 1.02.  Shareholders' Special Meetings
 
Special meetings of the shareholders may be called for any purpose or purposes, at any time, by the Chief Executive Officer; by the Chief Financial Officer; by the Board or any two or more members thereof; or by one or more shareholders holding not less than 10% of the voting power of all shares of the corporation entitled to vote (except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board for that purpose, must be called by 25% or more of the voting power of all shares of the corporation entitled to vote), who shall demand such special meeting by written notice given to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer specifying the purpose or purposes of such meeting.
 
Section 1.03.  Meetings Held Upon Shareholder Demand
 
Within 30 days of receipt of a demand by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer from any shareholder or shareholders entitled to call a meeting of the shareholders, it shall be the duty of the Board to cause a special or regular meeting of shareholders, as the case may be, to be duly called and held on notice no later than 90 days after receipt of such shareholder's or shareholders' demand.  If the Board fails to cause such a meeting to be called and held as required by this Section, the shareholder or shareholders making the demand may call the meeting by giving notice as provided in Section 1.04 at the expense of the corporation.
 
 
 
Section 1.04.  Notices of Meetings
 
Except as otherwise specified in Section 1.03 or required by law, written notice of the time and place of every meeting of shareholders, and in the case of a special meeting the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given at least 10 days and not more than 60 days previous thereto, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  Notice may be given to a shareholder by means of electronic communication if the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.436, Subdivision 5, as amended from time to time, are met.  Notice to a shareholder is also effectively given if the notice is addressed to the shareholder or a group of shareholders in a manner permitted by the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), provided that the corporation has first received the written or implied consent required by those rules and regulations.  The business transacted at a special meeting of shareholders is limited to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.
 
Section 1.05.  Quorum
 
A quorum at any meeting of shareholders shall consist of shareholders representing, either in person or by proxy, a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise specially provided by law.  If a quorum is not present at any such meeting, it may be adjourned from time to time until a quorum is present.
 
Section 1.06.  Adjournments
 
Any meeting of the shareholders may be adjourned from time to time to another date, time and place.  If any meeting of the shareholders is so adjourned, no notice as to such adjourned meeting need be given if the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened are announced at the time of adjournment and the adjourned meeting is held not more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
 
Section 1.07.  Proposals Regarding Business Other Than Director Nominations
 
(a)           The business transacted at any special meeting of shareholders is limited to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of the meeting given pursuant to Section 1.04.  The proposal of business (other than the nomination and election of Directors, which is subject to Section 2.09) to be considered by the shareholders at an annual meeting of shareholders may be made (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board, or (iii) by any shareholder of the corporation who complies with this Section 1.07.
 
(b)           For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary not less than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting.  If, however, the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by a shareholder is timely only if so received not
 
less than 90 days before the annual meeting or, if later, within 10 days after the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting.  Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the adjournment of an annual meeting will not commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as required above.
 
(c)           A shareholder's notice to the corporation must set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before an annual meeting:
 
(i)            a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting;
 
(ii)           any material interest in such business of the shareholder and of any beneficial owners on whose behalf the proposal is made;
 
(iii)          the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of any such beneficial owner;
 
(iv)  (A) the class or series (if any) and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such shareholder or any such beneficial owner, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right is subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") owned beneficially by such shareholder or any such beneficial owner and any other opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such shareholder or any such beneficial owner has a right to vote any shares of the corporation, (D) any short interest of such shareholder or any such beneficial owner in any security of the corporation (for purposes of these Bylaws, a person shall be deemed to have a "short interest" in a security if such person has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially by such shareholder or any such beneficial owner that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such shareholder or any such beneficial owner is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner, and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such shareholder or any such beneficial owner is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of
 
such shareholder's or any such beneficial owner's immediate family sharing the same household (which information called for by this Section 1.07(c)(iv) shall be supplemented by such shareholder not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to update and disclose such information as of the record date); and
 
(v)           a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares entitled to vote at the meeting, will continue to be a holder of record of shares entitled to vote at the meeting through the date of the meeting, and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to make the proposal.
 
(d)           The presiding officer at such meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures described in this Section 1.07 and, if the presiding officer so determines, any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
(e)           For purposes of this Section 1.07, "public announcement" means disclosure (i) when made in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, or comparable national news service, (ii) when contained in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) when given as the notice of the meeting pursuant to Section 1.04.
 
(f)            With respect to this Section 1.07, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of Minnesota law and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 1.07.
 
(g)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.07, this Section 1.07 does not apply to any shareholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  The requirements, procedures, and notice deadlines of Rule 14a-8 shall govern any proposal made pursuant thereto.
 
Section 2.01.  Regular Meetings
 
Regular meetings of the Board may be established by the Board.  They may be held without notice at the principal executive office of the corporation, or at such other place or places as the Board may from time to time designate.
 
Section 2.02.  Special Meetings
 
Special meetings of the Board may be called at any time by any member of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary of the corporation, to be held at the principal executive
 
office of the corporation or at such other place or places as the Directors may from time to time designate.  Notices of all special meetings of the Board shall be given to each Director by twenty-four hours' service of the same by letter, by telephone, by electronic communication or personally, provided that when notice is mailed, at least three days' notice shall be given.
 
Section 2.03.  Quorum
 
A majority of the Directors currently holding office shall be necessary at all meetings to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided herein, but a majority of the Directors present (although less than a quorum) may adjourn any meeting, which may be held on a subsequent date without further notice, provided that a quorum be present at such deferred meeting.  If a quorum is present when a meeting is convened, the Directors present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of Directors originally present leaves less than the number otherwise required for a quorum.
 
Section 2.04.  Waiver of Notice; Previously Scheduled Meetings
 
(a)           A Director may waive notice of the date, time and place of a meeting of the Board.  A waiver of notice by a Director entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance.  Attendance by a Director at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the Director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and thereafter does not participate in the meeting.
 
(b)           If the day or date, time and place of a Board meeting have been provided herein or announced at a previous meeting of the Board, no notice is required.  Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which adjournment is taken of the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened.
 
Section 2.05.  Action in Writing
 
Any action which may be taken at a meeting of the Board may be taken without a meeting if authorized by a writing or writings signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the Directors, and such action shall be effective when signed or consented to by authenticated electronic communication by all of the Directors or at such other time as is set forth therein.
 
Section 2.06.  Electronic Communications
 
Any action which may be taken at a meeting of the Board may be taken by means of conference telephone, or if authorized by the Board, by any other means of remote communication, by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, with the same effect as though all such persons were present
in person at such meeting.  Participation in a meeting by any such means constitutes presence in person at the meeting.
 
Section 2.07.  Absent Directors
 
A Director may give advance written consent or opposition to a proposal to be acted on at a Board meeting.  If the Director is not present at the meeting, consent or opposition to a proposal does not constitute presence for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but consent or opposition shall be counted as a vote in favor of or against the proposal and shall be entered in the minutes or other record of action at the meeting, if the proposal acted on at the meeting is substantially the same or has substantially the same effect as the proposal to which the Director has consented or objected.
 
Section 2.08.  Committees
 
(a)           A resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board may establish committees having the authority of the Board in the management of the business of the corporation to the extent provided in the resolution.  Committees shall be subject at all times to the direction and control of the Board, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section 2.08oras otherwise provided by law.
 
(b)           A committee shall consist of one or more natural persons, who need not be Directors, appointed by affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors present at a duly held Board meeting.
 
(c)           Sections 2.01 through 2.07 apply to committees and members of committees to the same extent as those sections apply to the Board and Directors.
 
(d)           Minutes, if any, of committee meetings shall be made available upon request to members of the committee and to any Director.
 
(e)           Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board establishing the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees, each consisting of one or more members of the committee, and may delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the authority of the committee.  In these Bylaws, unless the language or context clearly indicates that a different meaning is intended, any reference to a committee is deemed to include a subcommittee, and any reference to a committee member is deemed to include a subcommittee member.
 
(f)            The Board may establish a committee composed of one or more independent Directors or other independent persons to consider legal rights or remedies of the corporation and whether those rights and remedies should be pursued.
 
Section 2.09.  Director Nominations
 
(a)           Following the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.09 are eligible for
 
election as Directors at an annual meeting of shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of Directors who complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.09.
 
(b)           Nominations by shareholders must be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice of nominations to be made at an annual meeting must be received by the Secretary not less than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting.  If, however, the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by a shareholder is timely only if so received not less than 90 days before the annual meeting or, if later, within 10 days after the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting.  Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the adjournment of an annual meeting will not commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
 
(c)           A shareholder's notice to the corporation of nominations for an annual meeting of shareholders must set forth:
 
(i)            as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director:  (A) the person's name, (B) all information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in solicitations subject to Rule 14a-12(c) under the Exchange Act or that is required pursuant to any other provision of Regulation 14A or any other applicable regulation under the Exchange Act, and (C) the person's written consent to be named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a Director if elected; and
 
(ii)           as to the shareholder giving the notice:  (A) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of any beneficial owners on whose behalf the nomination is made, (B) the information called for by Section 1.07(c)(iv) hereof with respect to such shareholder and any such beneficial owner, and (C) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors, will continue to be a holder of record of shares entitled to vote for the election of Directors through the date of the meeting, and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice.
 
(d)           The presiding officer at such meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Section 2.09 and, if the presiding officer so determines, the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
 
(e)           For purposes of this Section 2.09, "public announcement" means disclosure (i) when made in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
 
Associated Press, or comparable national news service, (ii) when contained in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) when given as the notice of the meeting pursuant to Section 1.04.
 
(f)            With respect to this Section 2.09, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of Minnesota law and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.09.
 
(g)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.09, if the Securities and Exchange Commission adopts final rules requiring in certain events the inclusion in the corporation's proxy materials of persons nominated by shareholders for election to the Board of Directors, then the requirements, procedures, and notice deadlines of such final rules and not this Section 2.09 shall govern any nomination made pursuant to such final rules as if the corporation had no advance-notice requirements for such nominations.
 
Section 2.10.  Chairman of the Board
