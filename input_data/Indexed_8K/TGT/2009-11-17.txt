Exhibit 99
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, November 17, 2009  Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported net earnings of $436 million for the third quarter ended October 31, 2009, compared with $369 million in the third quarter ended November 1, 2008. Earnings per share in the third quarter increased 18.6 percent to $0.58 from $0.49 in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
"We're very pleased with our third quarter earnings performance, which reflects strong execution and a commitment to continued innovation by teams throughout the company," said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "Profitability in our retail segment during the third quarter was well above expectations, and credit card segment profitability also improved due to continued thoughtful portfolio management in a challenging credit environment. As we look ahead, we remain keenly focused on delighting our guests with exciting merchandise, exceptional prices and superior service during the holiday season and believe we are well-positioned to capture profitable market share."
 
Retail Segment Results
Sales increased 1.4 percent in the third quarter to $14.8 billion in 2009 from $14.6 billion in 2008, due to the contribution from new store expansion, partially offset by a 1.6 percent decline in comparable-store sales. Retail segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $791 million in the third quarter of 2009, a 2.4 percent increase from $772 million in 2008.
Third quarter gross margin rate increased to 30.8 percent from 30.6 percent in 2008, due to gross margin rate improvements within categories, partially offset by a smaller-than-expected mix impact of faster sales growth in non-discretionary lower margin rate categories. Third quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense dollars were up 0.5 percent compared to 2008, as the expense related to operating additional stores was substantially offset by productivity improvements. At quarter-end, the company was operating 59 more stores than a year ago.
Depreciation and amortization was $533 million in the third quarter, up 14.8 percent from $465 million in 2008. More than half of this increase was driven by the recognition of accelerated depreciation on store assets that are expected to be replaced as part of the company's 2010 store remodel program.
 
Credit Card Segment Results
Average credit card receivables in the quarter decreased $547 million, or 6.3 percent, from the third quarter of 2008, and quarter-end receivables decreased $717 million, or 8.2 percent, from the same period a year ago.

Credit card segment profit in the quarter increased to $60 million from $35 million last year as a result of improved portfolio performance that more than offset the impact of lower floating interest rates. Target's pretax return on invested capital (ROIC) from its investment in the credit card segment increased to 9.0 percent in the third quarter from 4.3 percent in 2008.
Net write-offs in the quarter were $280 million, in line with expectations. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,025 million at quarter-end, compared with $1,004 million at the end of the second quarter.
 
Other Expenses
Net interest expense for the quarter decreased $43 million from third quarter 2008 to $191 million, reflecting a lower average portfolio interest rate combined with lower average debt balances.
The company's effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 36.1 percent in 2009, down from 41.7 percent in 2008, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of reserves recorded for tax uncertainties and a higher proportion of earnings that are not subject to tax. For the full year, the company now expects an effective income tax rate in the range of 36.5 to 37.5 percent.
 
Fourth Quarter Outlook
In light of the current and projected economic environment and expectations for a highly promotional holiday season, Target remains cautious about fourth quarter performance and is planning conservatively in both business segments.
