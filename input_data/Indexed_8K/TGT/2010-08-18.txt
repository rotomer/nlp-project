FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS, August 18, 2010
 Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported net earnings of $679 million for the quarter ended July 31, 2010, compared with $594 million in the quarter ended August 1, 2009. Earnings per share in the second quarter increased 17.0 percent to 92 cents from 79 cents in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
 
"Our retail segment generated strong profitability, overcoming softer-than-expected sales," said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "Growth in guest traffic and apparel sales remained robust, and teams across the company continued to exercise thoughtful control of expenses. Our credit card segment also enjoyed very strong results, as disciplined underwriting, superb execution and improving risk trends caused a sharp reduction in bad debt expense compared with last year. Regardless of the pace of recovery, we are well-positioned to continue to gain profitable market share."
 
Retail Segment Results
 
Sales increased 3.8 percent in the second quarter to $15.1 billion in 2010 from $14.6 billion in 2009, due to the contribution from new stores combined with a 1.7 percent increase in comparable-store sales. Retail segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $1,096 million in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 3.1 percent from $1,064 million in 2009.
 
Second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 10.5 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, compared with 10.6 percent and 7.3 percent in 2009. These changes were the result of slight changes in the gross margin rate, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate, and the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense rate.
 
Second quarter gross margin rate was 32.0 percent, up from 31.9 percent in 2009. The impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was essentially neutral, as sales increased at a similar pace in both higher-margin and lower-margin categories.
 
Second quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.5 percent, up from 21.4 percent in 2009.
 
Credit Card Segment Results
 
Second quarter segment profit increased to $149 million from $63 million a year ago, as bad debt expense declined 54.5 percent from $303 million in second quarter 2009 to $138 million this year.
 
Second quarter average receivables decreased 15.1 percent to $7.1 billion in 2010 from $8.4 billion in 2009. Average receivables directly funded by Target increased in the second quarter to $3.0 billion from $2.9 billion in 2009.
 
Annualized segment pre-tax return on invested capital was 20.2 percent in the second quarter 2010, compared with 8.8 percent a year ago.
 
Interest Expense and Taxes
 
Net interest expense for the quarter decreased $9 million from second quarter 2009, driven by lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate.
 
The company's effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 37.2 percent in 2010, down from 37.9 percent in 2009.
 
Share Repurchase
 
In the second quarter, under the share repurchase program originally announced in November 2007 and resumed in January 2010, the company repurchased 17.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $51.72, for a total investment of $907 million.
 
Program-to-date through the end of the second quarter, the company has acquired 128.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $51.46, reflecting a total investment of $6.6 billion.

Retail Segment Results
 
 
EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

(b) Amounts represent the portion of average credit card receivables funded by Target. These amounts exclude $4,148 million and $4,667 million for the three and six months ended July 31, 2010, respectively, and $5,508 million and $5,502 million for the three and six months ended August 1, 2009, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables.
