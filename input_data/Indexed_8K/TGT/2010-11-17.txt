MINNEAPOLIS (Nov. 17, 2010)
 Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) today reported net earnings of $535 million for the quarter ended October 30, 2010, compared with $436 million in the quarter ended October 31, 2009. Earnings per share in the third quarter increased 28.5 percent to 74 cents from 58 cents in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
 
"We're pleased with Target's third quarter financial performance, and we are well-positioned for the fourth quarter," said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "We've built our holiday season plans to create excitement and provide our guests unbeatable value. In addition, our guests can save more than ever with our new 5% REDcard rewards program. Based on our merchandising and marketing plans, combined with the expected impact of REDcard rewards and our newly completed remodel program, we expect Target's fourth quarter comparable-store performance will be the best of any quarter in the last three years."
 
Retail Segment Results
 
Sales increased 3.0 percent in the third quarter to $15.2 billion in 2010 from $14.8 billion in 2009, due to a 1.6 percent increase in comparable-store sales combined with the contribution from new stores. Retail segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $816 million in third quarter 2010, an increase of 3.2 percent from $791 million in 2009.
 
Third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 8.8 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, compared with 9.0 percent and 5.3 percent in 2009. These changes were the result of a modest decline in the gross margin rate, offset by favorability in the selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate and the depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense rate.
 
Third quarter gross margin rate was 30.6 percent, down from 30.8 percent in 2009. The impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was essentially neutral, as sales increased at a similar pace in both higher-margin and lower-margin categories.
 
Third quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.8 percent, down from 21.9 percent in 2009.
 
Credit Card Segment Results
 
Third quarter segment profit increased to $130 million from $60 million a year ago, as bad debt expense declined 64 percent from $301 million in third quarter 2009 to $110 million this year.
 
Third quarter average receivables decreased 16.3 percent to $6.9 billion in 2010 from $8.2 billion in 2009. Average receivables directly funded by Target increased in the third quarter to $2.8 billion from $2.7 billion in 2009.
 
Annualized segment pre-tax return on invested capital was 18.5 percent in the third quarter 2010, compared with 9.0 percent a year ago.
 
Interest Expense and Taxes
 
Net interest expense for the quarter increased $3 million from third quarter 2009, driven by a higher average portfolio interest rate, partially offset by lower average debt balances reflecting lower average credit card receivables.
 
The company's effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.8 percent in 2010, down from 36.1 percent in 2009, primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of various state
income tax matters which increased earnings per share by approximately 6 cents in third quarter 2010.
 
Share Repurchase
 
In third quarter 2010, under the share repurchase program originally announced in November 2007 and resumed in January 2010, the company repurchased 15.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $52.29, for a total investment of $793 million.
 
Program-to-date through the end of third quarter 2010, the company has acquired 143.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $51.55, reflecting a total investment of $7.4 billion.

(a)
 Loyalty Program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our Retail Segment.  Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program.  In the three months and nine months ended October 30, 2010, these reimbursed amounts were $26 million and $60 million, respectively, compared with $19 million and $59 million in the corresponding periods in 2009.  In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.
