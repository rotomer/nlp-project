Exhibit 99
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
MINNEAPOLIS (May 18, 2011)
 Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today reported net earnings of $689  million for the quarter ended April 30, 2011, compared with $671 million in the quarter ended May 1, 2010. Earnings per share in the first quarter increased 9.8 percent to $0.99 from $0.90 in the same period a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
 
"Our first quarter financial performance was the result of stronger-than-expected profitability in our Credit Card Segment, which offset the impact of weaker-than-anticipated sales in our Retail Segment," said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "Our PFresh remodel program and 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program continue to deliver incremental traffic and sales in an environment where our guests remain cautious in their spending. Throughout the organization we're focused on driving sales by providing value, quality and reliability to our guests and delivering on both halves of our brand promise."
Expect More. Pay Less.
 
 
U.S. Retail Segment Results
 
As previously reported, sales increased 2.8 percent in the first quarter to $15.6 billion in 2011 from $15.2 billion in 2010, due to a 2.0 percent increase in comparable-store sales and the contribution from new stores. Segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $1,062 million in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of 4.2 percent from $1,108 million in 2010.
 
First quarter 2011 EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 10.1 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, compared with 10.7 percent and 7.3 percent in 2010. First quarter gross margin rate declined to 30.4 percent in 2011 from 31.3 percent in 2010, due primarily to the impact of the company's PFresh remodel program and its 5% REDcard Rewards initiative. The company's first quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate was 20.4 percent in 2011, down from 20.6 percent in 2010.
 
Canadian Segment Results
 
First quarter 2011 EBIT was $(11) million due to start-up expenses related to the company's expected market entry in 2013.

First quarter bad debt expense was $12 million in 2011, down from $197 million in 2010, driven by improved trends in key measures of risk.

(a) Loyalty Program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our U.S. Retail Segment.  Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which our U.S. Credit Card segment reimburses our U.S. Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. In the three months ended April 30, 2011, these reimbursed amounts were $49 million, compared with $17 million in the corresponding period in 2010. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the U.S. Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the U.S. Credit Card Segment.
 
 
U.S. Retail Segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales.
