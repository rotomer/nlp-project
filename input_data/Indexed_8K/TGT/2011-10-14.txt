Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On October 14, 2011, Target Corporation ("Target") entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement with certain lenders, Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and Citibank, N.A. as syndication agent, for a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement").  Target may increase the credit facility commitments up to an additional $500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.   The Credit Agreement will expire in October 2016, unless extended for up to two additional years under the terms of the Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and Target's debt ratings.  The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants regarding the secured debt level and leverage ratio of Target and its subsidiaries.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type.  Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders, the obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated.
 
A copy of the Credit Agreement will be filed as an Exhibit to Target's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 29, 2011.
