Exhibit 99
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS (August 15, 2012)
 Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today reported second quarter net earnings of $704 million, or $1.06 per share. Adjusted earnings per share, a measure the company believes is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of its U.S. operations, were $1.12 in second quarter 2012, up 4.6 percent from $1.07 in 2011. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided in the tables attached to this press release. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
 
"We're pleased with Target's strong second quarter financial performance, which reflects a continued focus on delivering an outstanding experience for our guests and disciplined execution of our strategy," said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Target Corporation. "In addition, we're very pleased with the initial response to the July opening of our first three CityTarget locations in Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. We look forward to serving guests in these dense urban areas with an exciting store format and uniquely-tailored assortment."
 
Fiscal 2012 Earnings Guidance
 
For third quarter 2012, the company expects adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.93 and GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.79.
 
For full-year 2012, the company has raised its guidance and now expects adjusted EPS of $4.65 to $4.85 and GAAP EPS of $4.20 to $4.40.
 
 
The difference between the GAAP and adjusted EPS range of 14 cents in the third quarter reflects the expected EPS impact of expenses related to the company's Canadian market entry.
 
The difference between the GAAP and adjusted EPS range of 45 cents for the full year reflects the expected 50-cent EPS impact of expenses related to the company's Canadian market entry, offset by the beneficial impact of the resolution of income tax matters recognized in first and second quarter 2012.
 
U.S. Retail Segment Results
 
As previously reported, sales increased 3.5 percent to $16.5 billion in second quarter 2012 from $15.9 billion last year, reflecting a 3.1 percent increase in comparable-store sales combined with the contribution from new stores.
 
Segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $1,181 million in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 2.9 percent from $1,147 million in 2011. Second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 10.2 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, compared with 10.3 percent and 7.2 percent in 2011. Second quarter gross margin rate declined to 31.3 percent in 2012 from 31.6 percent in 2011, reflecting the impact of the company's integrated growth strategies partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories. Second quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2012 compared with 21.3 percent in 2011, reflecting disciplined control of expenses across the organization.
 
U.S. Credit Card Segment Results
 
Second quarter average receivables decreased 5.0 percent to $5.9 billion in 2012 from $6.2 billion in 2011. Second quarter 2012 portfolio spread to LIBOR was $140 million, or 9.5 percent, compared with $186 million, or 12.0 percent, in 2011. Performance in second quarter 2012 reflected a $30 million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts, compared with an $85 million reduction in second quarter 2011.
 
Canadian Segment Results
 
Second quarter 2012 EBIT was $(69) million, due to start-up expenses, depreciation and amortization related to the company's expected market entry in 2013. Total expenses related to investments in Target's Canadian market entry reduced Target's earnings per share by approximately 9 cents in second quarter 2012.(1)
 
(1) This amount includes interest expense and tax expense that are not included in the segment measure of profit. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to this release.
 
Interest Expense and Taxes
 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $184 million, including $19 million of interest on capitalized leases related to Target's Canadian market entry. Net interest expense was $191 million in second quarter 2011.
 
The company's effective income tax rate was 34.3 percent in second quarter 2012, including the favorable resolution of various income tax matters which benefited second quarter EPS by approximately 3 cents.
 
Capital Returned to Shareholders
 
In second quarter 2012, the company repurchased approximately 9.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $57.09, for a total investment of $549 million. The company also paid dividends of $198 million during the quarter.

Investors and the media are invited to listen to the call through the company's website at www.target.com/investors (click on "Events + Presentations" and then "Archives + Webcasts"). A telephone replay of the call will be available beginning at approximately 11:30 a.m. CDT today through the end of business on August 17, 2012.

Statements in this release regarding third quarter and fiscal 2012 earnings guidance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements speak only as of the date they are made and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause the company's actual results to differ materially. The most important risks and uncertainties are described in Item 1A of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012.
 
In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Management believes adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the company's U.S. operations. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate adjusted EPS differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
 
A detailed reconciliation is provided below.
 
 
Note:
Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions. To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of our planned 2013 Canadian market entry and favorable resolutions of various income tax matters. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations. The sum of the non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding.

Represents interest expense, net of interest income, not included in U.S. Credit Card segment profit.  For the three and six months ended July 28, 2012, U.S. Credit Card segment profit included $3 million and $5 million of interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables, compared with $18 million and $37 million in the respective prior year periods. These amounts, along with other net interest expense, equal consolidated GAAP net interest expense.
(b) 
Taxes are allocated to our business segments based on estimated income tax rates applicable to the operations of the segment for the period.

For the three and six months ended July 28, 2012, average diluted shares outstanding were 662.9 million and 667.6 million, respectively, and for the three and six months ended July 30, 2011, average diluted shares outstanding were 685.1 million and 691.2 million, respectively.
