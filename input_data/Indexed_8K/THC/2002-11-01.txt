Exhibit 99.2
        
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.Nov. 1, 2002
Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) today issued the following comment:
        Rumors are apparently circulating that the company intends to announce new negative news on its conference call, scheduled for 1:00 pm PDT today. That is untrue.
        The purpose of the conference call is simply to respond to investor questions about recent events. Given that the company has honored a very heavy schedule of previously planned investor meetings in New York and Boston throughout the week, management has been unable to respond to the vast number of phone calls and e-mails it has received since Monday. The conference call is our attempt to make ourselves available to everyone, to share as much information as we can, and to respond to questions. There is no new disclosure event.
        The timing of the call after the close of market today was dictated by logistical concerns and by our desire to accommodate as many participants as possible, and have time for as many questions as possible.
        Tenet is gratified to learn that the company is not under investigation in connection with the FBI's service on Wednesday of search warrants at two physicians' offices and Redding Medical Center, Tenet's hospital in Redding, Calif., according to Laura Schwartz, a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Sacramento, Calif. Schwartz was quoted in today's edition of the
Wall Street Journal.
        An Oct. 30 press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office stated that the searches "are part of an ongoing health care fraud investigation" of the two physicians. According to the affidavits, "federal authorities are investigating whether unnecessary invasive coronary procedures on patients, including heart catheterizations, angioplasty, and open heart surgeries, have been performed," the press release said.
