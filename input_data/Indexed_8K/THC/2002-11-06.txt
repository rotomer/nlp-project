Exhibit 99
        
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.November 6, 2002
Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) today announced that it has received an audit request from the Kansas City office of the Office of Audit Services of the Department of Health and Human Services. The letter states that the objective of the audit is to determine whether outlier payments to Tenet hospitals were paid in accordance with Medicare laws and regulations.
        "In the past week, some have insinuated that Tenet hospitals did not comply with Medicare rules governing outlier payments," said Jeffrey C. Barbakow, Tenet chairman and chief executive officer. "We are pleased to cooperate with this audit, as we are confident that it will demonstrate that our hospitals did, in fact, obey the rules."
        Specifically, the letter states that the audit will concentrate on certain components of the formula used to calculate outlier payments. The company expects that the audit will enable it to have a full and frank discussion with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services about the factors that have contributed to Tenet's outlier payments.
        Last Friday in a conference call with investors and interested parties, Tenet management committed to providing additional data and information about its outlier payments. To uphold that commitment, Tenet management has scheduled a conference call and simultaneous webcast for Thurs., November 7. Details are given at the end of this release. In order to accommodate as many listeners as possible, the call will be held after the market closes Thursday. The timing is for logistical reasons only.
        Separately, the company said that misinformation and false rumors about it continue to circulate. To that end, the company will strive to issue clarifications and denials, as appropriate, on a timely basis. The company believes that many of these false rumors and misinformation are attributable to legal adversaries, critics with their own agendas and those who stand to benefit if Tenet's stock declines, and therefore should be viewed in that light.

On Tues., a plaintiff's attorney in Florida petitioned for a temporary restraining order to prevent Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center from inappropriately destroying documents. The allegation was made after a shredding service made its normal, weekly pick-up at the hospital Tuesday. The judge ruled for the hospital after it produced documentation, including invoices, that this was simply a weekly, on-going service for customary disposal of sensitive materials, such as duplicate copies of contracts, confidential patient information, etc.
