Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements contained in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company's actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Such factors include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions, both nationally and regionally; industry capacity; demographic changes; changes in, or the failure to comply with, laws and governmental regulations; the ability to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms; changes in Medicare and Medicaid payments or reimbursement, including those resulting from a shift from traditional reimbursement to managed care plans; the outcome of known and unknown litigation and government investigations; the outcome of asserted and unasserted liability and other claims against the Company; competition, including the Company's failure to attract patients to its hospitals; the loss of any significant customers; technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for, health care; a shortage of raw material, a breakdown in the distribution process or other factors that may increase the Company's cost of supplies; changes in business strategy or development plans including the Company's pricing strategy; the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel, including physicians, nurses and other health care professionals, including the impact on the Company's labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses or other health care professionals; fluctuations in the market value of the Company's common stock; the significant indebtedness of the Company; the availability of suitable acquisition opportunities, the length of time it takes to accomplish acquisitions and the impact of pending and future government investigations and litigation on the Company's ability to accomplish acquisitions; the Company's ability to integrate new businesses with its existing operations; and the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of the Company's business, including the acquisition of additional facilities.  Certain additional risks and uncertainties are discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  Do not rely on any forward-looking statement, as we cannot predict or control many of the factors that ultimately may affect our ability to achieve the results estimated.  We make no promise to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.

PRICING STRATEGY
Unique Aspects of Hospital Pricing
 
 -                Wide disparity between gross charges and net revenue
 
 -                All payors are billed gross charges; virtually none actually pay gross charges
 
 -                Patient largely divorced from payment mechanisms; pays only minimal portion of bill
 
 -                Different and conflicting pricing mechanisms for each payor group

High administrative cost incurred on remaining 70% of patients who pay nearly nothing
 
 - 
                                           
Ill will generated among those 70% during collections process
 
 
SELF-PAY
Self-Pay Proposed Strategy
 
 
 - 
                                           
Propose new policy to offer self-pay patients contracts with hospital-specific rates
 
 - 
                                           
Establish rates by local markets, aligned with local managed care rates
 
 - 
                                           
Implementation will require OIG approval and is subject to state law

Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) today released the results of an internal business review of its past pricing strategies and presented a new pricing philosophy that includes substantial proposed discounts for uninsured patients. The review's findings and the new approach to pricing are being discussed today and tomorrow by senior Tenet executives at meetings with investors and analysts in New York.  These meetings will be available by webcast to all interested parties.
 
Tenet also announced that, as a result of its review of operations and based on current expectations, it has revised its guidance for earnings for its fiscal years ending May 31, 2003 and 2004.  The specific earnings guidance is discussed later in this news release.
 
The company's new executive management team has been reviewing its charges, pricing and overall business strategy for several weeks, following disclosure that the company's previous approach to charges had caused some Tenet hospitals to receive greater Medicare outlier payments than the industry average.
 
"The company's charging practices, combined with the formula prescribed by the Medicare program, in large part caused Tenet's total outlier payments to exceed industry
 
 
 
averages," said Jeffrey C. Barbakow, Tenet's chairman and chief executive officer.  "In the hospital industry, gross charges' are not the same as prices.'  Gross charges are essentially retail list rates and are required by the Medicare program to be the same for all patients.  But gross charges rarely bear any resemblance to what we are actually paid for the services we provide.  Our new approach is designed to de-emphasize the role of gross charges and refocus on actual pricing."
 
Elements of the company's new pricing approach include:
 
 - 
                 
Freezing its hospital gross charges for the time being.  No rollbacks have been implemented, and no increases are planned through the rest of this fiscal year ending May 31, 2003.
 
 - 
                 
Pursuing a contract structure with managed care companies that has a larger component based on negotiated per diem rates and reduced relative importance of "stop-loss" payments tied to gross charges.  Tenet said it would pursue this approach as long as its managed care partners are willing to preserve the underlying aggregate economics of the contracts.  Regardless of future contract structure, Tenet believes it will be able to continue to receive market level increases in its managed care revenues.
 
 - 
                 
Proposing a discounted price schedule at managed care rates for uninsured patients.  Current regulations require hospitals to bill these patients at gross-charge rates. The company is committed to working cooperatively with appropriate state and federal officials to make the changes necessary to implement this proposal and ease the burden on the uninsured.  The discount also will significantly cut hospitals' administrative costs associated with billing and collecting from a relatively small number of patients.
 
"We have put this new pricing philosophy in motion, and it is already producing some results," Barbakow said.  "On Monday, we announced a new agreement with Health Net of California that mirrors our new strategy."
 
The company said it has not articulated a new approach to pricing for Medicare or Medicaid because the federal government determines the amounts hospitals are paid under these programs.  However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has indicated its intention to change the current Medicare rules regarding outlier payments.  CMS has not yet announced specific changes, but Tenet expects that any such changes will reduce the amount of outlier payments received by its hospitals.
 
 
 
 
 "We have a lot of work to do to recover from the events of recent weeks, and I do not underestimate the task we have ahead of us," said Barbakow. "I recognize the very real skepticism and anger among investors.  We intend to earn back their trust through hard work and solid results."
 
Trevor Fetter, the company's new president, led the review of Tenet's pricing and overall business strategies over the past month.  "I am convinced that the solutions we have set forth will not only correct the anomalies that have brought Tenet so much negative attention recently but will also regain the trust of our investors and others," Fetter said.
 
"As I have examined Tenet's operations, I have become more confident than ever about the company's fundamental strength.  We have now set in motion a plan to address the issues raised by our gross charges.  We have the assets, the resources and the people to resume a sustainable level of growth and to continue enhancing health care in the communities we serve."
 
Fiscal 2003 Earnings Guidance
 
Tenet has revised its guidance for earnings in its fiscal year ending May 31, 2003.  The company now expects that earnings per share from operations will likely be in a range of $2.38 to $2.78 per share, compared to $2.34 per share in fiscal 2002 (adjusted to reflect the adoption of SFAS 142).
 
The low end of the range assumes the elimination of all Medicare outlier payments effective Jan. 1, 2003, while the upper end of the range assumes no change in Medicare outlier payment methodology that would affect the current fiscal year.  While the company believes that the most likely scenario is somewhere between these two extremes, it is unable to predict at this time what changes will actually be made in outlier payments.  Tenet expects to further refine this guidance once the details and timing of changes in outlier reimbursement are known.
 
 
 
 
Tenet had previously estimated that fiscal 2003 earnings per share from operations would be at least 25% above fiscal 2002 earnings, or at least $2.93.  The change in guidance reflects what the company believes is a conservative provision for both known and unknown contingencies, as well as the recognition that CMS may change outlier payment methods sooner than the company had previously anticipated.
 
Fiscal 2004 Earnings Guidance
 
In its presentation to investors, Tenet detailed a range of assumptions for its 2004 fiscal year, including assumptions regarding patient volumes, price trends by type of payor, outlier payments, margins, interest, depreciation and other expenses, cash flow, share repurchases and other factors.  Investors are urged to review the full presentation, which is available on Tenet's web site, , for a complete discussion of these assumptions.

Based on the assumptions made, Tenet presented a "base case" for earnings per share from operations of approximately $2.00 in fiscal 2004, a level from which it expects to resume its growth.  The company stressed that this number should be viewed as a midpoint in a wider range, and depends on the underlying assumptions, which the company believes are conservative.  Notably, the estimate assumes total Medicare outlier payments of $150 million, and assumes no share repurchases beyond the company's current authorization.  As with the 2003 guidance, the company will further refine its 2004 guidance once it has better clarity regarding future outlier payment methodology.
 
Stephen D. Farber, Tenet's new chief financial officer, outlined expectations for substantial free cash flow in fiscal 2004.  "With Tenet shares trading at current levels, the highest and best use of free cash flow is share repurchases," Farber said.  "I want to assure investors we understand the importance of this use for Tenet's free cash flow."
