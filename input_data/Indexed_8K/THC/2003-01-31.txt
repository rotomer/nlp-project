In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note (including upon an exchange, transfer, redemption or repurchase of this Note in part only) effected in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, the Security Registrar, upon receipt of notice of such event from the Depositary's custodian for this Note, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect an increase or decrease of the Outstanding principal amount of Notes of this series resulting from such deposit or withdrawal, as the case may be.
        The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
        As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Notes of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
        No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
        No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

        (a)  (i)  Liens securing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of construction of property acquired or constructed by the Company or a Subsidiary, provided such debt and related Lien are incurred within 12 months after acquisition, or completion of construction and full operation, whichever is later;
        (ii)  Liens on property owned by the Company or a Subsidiary securing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of construction of additions, substantial repairs or alterations or substantial improvements to such property, provided such debt and related Lien are incurred within 12 months after the completion of such construction, additions, repairs, alterations or improvements;
        (b)  Liens existing on property at the time of acquisition of such property by the Company or a Subsidiary or on the property of an entity at the time of the acquisition of such entity by the Company or a Subsidiary (including acquisitions through merger or consolidation),
provided
that such Liens were in existence prior to the closing of, and not incurred in contemplation of, such acquisition and, in the case of the acquisition of an entity, the Liens do not extend to any assets other than those of the entity acquired;
        (c)  In the case of a Consolidated Subsidiary, Liens in favor of the Company or another Consolidated Subsidiary;

        (g)  Liens created in substitution of or as replacements for any Liens permitted by clauses (a) to (f) set forth herein, provided that, based on a good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, the property encumbered by any substitute or replacement Lien is substantially similar in nature to and no greater in value than the property encumbered by the otherwise permitted Lien that is being replaced; and
        (h)  Any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Lien referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) to (g) inclusive or of any debt secured thereby; provided that the principal amount of debt secured thereby shall not exceed the principal amount of debt so secured at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement, and that such extension, renewal or replacement Lien shall be limited to all or part of the same property that secured the Lien extended, renewed or replaced (plus improvements on such property).
Section 3.2 Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions
        The Company covenants and agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary will enter into any arrangement with any Person (other than the Company or a Subsidiary), or to which any such Person is a party, providing for the leasing to the Company or a Subsidiary for a period of more than three years of any Principal Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such Person or to any other Person (other than the Company or a Subsidiary), to which the funds have been or are to be advanced by such Person on the security of the leased property (herein referred to as "Sale and Lease-Back Transactions") unless either:
        (i)    the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled, pursuant to Section 3.1, to incur debt secured by a Lien on the property to be leased, without equally and ratably securing the Notes, or
        (ii)  the Company (and in any such case the Company covenants and agrees that it will do so) during or immediately after the expiration of 120 days after the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction (whether made by the Company or a Subsidiary) applies an amount equal to the value of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction to the acquisition, construction, addition, reparation, alteration or improvement of a Principal Property and/or to the voluntary retirement of any debt of the Company which would be defined as long-term debt on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
        For purposes of this Section 3.2, the term "value" shall mean, with respect to a Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, as of any particular time, the amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale or transfer of the property leased pursuant to such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction divided first by the number of full years of the term of the lease and then multiplied by the number of full years of such term remaining at the time of determination, without regard to any renewal or extension options contained in the lease.
Section 3.3 Exception to Limitations
        Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the Company and any Subsidiary may issue, incur, create, assume or guarantee debt secured by Liens and enter into Sale and Lease-Back Transactions that would otherwise be subject to the restrictions in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, provided (a) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all other debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is subject to the restrictions in Section 3.1 (not including debt permitted to be secured under clauses (a) to (f) inclusive of Section 3.1), plus (b) the aggregate Attributable Debt in respect of the Sale and Lease-Back Transactions in existence at such time (not including Sale and Lease-Back Transactions permitted by Section 3.2(i) or (ii)), does not exceed 15% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

No supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby, modify any of the provisions of this Section 3.4, except to increase the percentage required to waive compliance by the Company of the covenants referenced here, provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section 3.4.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif.Jan. 23, 2003
Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) today announced that it has increased its previously announced offering of $500 million of debt securities to $1 billion. The company today priced the 10-year notes, issuing 7 3/8% Senior Notes due 2013 priced at 97.868%.
        The company said that it decided to upsize the bond offering instead of completing its previously announced $500 million 3-year term loan, which has been cancelled. Tenet intends to use the proceeds from this bond offering to repay the entirety of its current borrowings under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures in 2006 and for general corporate purposes.
        The covenants governing the new issue are identical to the covenants governing Tenet's other outstanding bond issues. The company said that it would alter the leverage covenant in its existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to conform to what would have been put into place on the $500 million 3-year term loan, had it been executed. Specifically, the leverage covenant will now be a maximum of 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA, versus the previous 3.5x maximum.
        The offering was led by Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, The Bank of Nova Scotia, SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. and UBS Warburg LLC served as co-managers in the offering.
        A shelf registration relating to this offering has been declared effective. This offering was made pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the shelf registration statement on file with the SEC.
        Copies of the prospectus settlement, when available, may be obtained from Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013; telephone (212) 816-6000.
        This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
        Tenet Healthcare Corporation, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates 114 acute care hospitals with 27,851 beds and numerous related health care services.
