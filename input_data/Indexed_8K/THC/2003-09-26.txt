The federal anti-kickback statute is codified at Title 42, United States Code, Section 1320a-7b(b). Under the anti-kickback statute, among other things, it is illegal to knowingly and willfully confer any remuneration, including any bribe, kickback or rebate, to any person, if any one purpose of conferring that remuneration is to induce that person to refer an individual for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made under a Federal health care program.
10.
                                
 
The purpose of the anti-kickback statute is to ensure that the medical referral decision is made with the patient's best interest in mind, and to prevent inflation of the cost of medical treatment by the payment of referral fees and by the referral of patients for care that they do not need.
11.
                                
 
 
On or about June 29, 1994, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare Corporation (then known as National Medical Enterprises, Inc.) pled guilty to federal criminal charges that its psychiatric hospitals, among other things, made payments to doctors in exchange for patient referrals, in violation of the federal anti-kickback statute. Tenet also entered into a 5-year civil and administrative agreement with the government that included a Corporate Integrity Agreement ("CIA") with the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
12.
                                
The CIA provided that Tenet would maintain a Corporate Integrity Program that would involve all company directors, officers, employees and contractors. The CIA also mandated that Tenet would establish a Corporate Integrity Program Management Committee, chaired by Tenet's President and Chief Operating Officer, to administer the Corporate Integrity Program. The CIA provided that "The Corporate Integrity Program shall be maintained so as to ensure, to the extent reasonably possible, that [Tenet] and each of its directors, officers, employees and contractors maintain the business integrity required of a participant in federally-funded health care programs, and that [Tenet's] delivery of medical care is in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such programs and with the terms of this Agreement."
13.
                                
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation's written corporate policy on physician relocation and recruitment agreements, promulgated as an interim policy on July 1, 1993, and as a final policy on October 1, 1995, provided that any monetary benefits conferred by a physician relocation and recruitment agreement must not "inure to the benefit of any physician(s) other than the recruited physician." Tenet's policy also mandated the CEO of any hospital entering into such an agreement should submit the proposed Relocation Agreement and supporting documentation, with a cover memo, to the Regional Vice President of Operations and the Regional Law Department for pre-approval.
14.
                                
 
All Tenet employees, including defendants BARRY WEINBAUM and MINA NAZARYAN received regular ethics training, including training on the federal anti-kickback statute.

From 1992 to the present, defendant BARRY WEINBAUM has executed more than 100 physician Relocation Agreements on behalf of defendant TENET HEALTHSYSTEM HOSPITALS, INC. and defendant ALVARADO HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER, INC., which resulted in more than $10,000,000 in payments to physicians.
16.
                                
 
Much of the more than $10,000,000 paid pursuant to the Relocation Agreements inured to the benefit of the established physician practices that the relocated physicians joined.
17.
                                
 
 
The San Diego Sports Medicine & Orthopaedic Center, Dr. Paul Ver Hoeve, Dr. John Gaidry, the Mid-City Medical Group, Drs. Hamid and Nasrin Mani, Dr. Larry Emdur, the Center for Family Health and Dr. Richard Parker are established physician practices located in San Diego County.
18.
                                
 
All of established physician practices identified in paragraph 18 referred Federal health care program patients, including Medicare and/or Medi-Cal beneficiaries, to Alvarado Hospital.
19.
                                
 
 
Paragraphs 1-19 of the Introductory Allegations hereby are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
1.
                                      
 
On or about a date unknown and continuing until the date of this indictment, within the Southern District of California, and elsewhere, defendants BARRY WEINBAUM, TENET HEALTHSYSTEM HOSPITALS, INC., ALVARADO HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER, INC., and MINA NAZARYAN did knowingly and intentionally conspire with each other and with others known and unknown to the grand jury to commit offenses against the
2.
                                      
United States, that is violations of Title 42, United States Code, Section 1320a-7b (b) (1) (A) (soliciting and receiving remunerations); and Title 42, United States Code, Section 1320a-7b (b) (2) (A) (offering and paying remunerations).
 
It was part of the conspiracy that defendants BARRY WEINBAUM, TENET HEALTHSYSTEM HOSPITALS, INC., ALVARADO HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER, INC., and MINA NAZARYAN induced physicians to refer patients insured by a Federal health care program to Alvarado Hospital's inpatient and outpatient facilities by:
3.
                                      
 
Paying physicians to locate their practices in the Alvarado Hospital service area;
a.
                                      
 
Paying money to physicians pursuant to Relocation Agreements having previously arranged for much of that money to be passed through to established physician practices that defendants had targeted for increased referrals, and to established physician practices that were loyal referrers of patients to Alvarado Hospital;
b.
                                      
 
Paying Relocation Agreement benefits to relatives of established physicians whom defendants had targeted for increased referrals, and to relatives of established physicians who were loyal referrers of patients to Alvarado Hospital; and
c.
                                       
 
Paying physicians pursuant to "personal services contracts" for managing, marketing, and expanding their own practices.
d.
                                      
It was a further part of the conspiracy that, from 1992 to the present, defendants BARRY WEINBAUM, TENET HEALTHSYSTEM HOSPITALS, INC., ALVARADO HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER, INC., and MINA NAZARYAN caused more than $10,000,000 to be paid to more than 100 physicians who agreed to locate their practices in the Alvarado Hospital service area, and to the established physician practices that those physicians
4.
                                      
joined, with the intent to induce those physicians to refer patients to Alvarado Hospital.
