Tenet Affiliate in New Orleans Receives Second U.S. Subpoena.
 
On October 10, 2003, People's Health Network (PHN) received a second subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's office in New Orleans seeking additional documents.  This new subpoena seeks patient information for Tenet Choices members who were admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit and members for whom inpatient rehabilitation services were ordered, recommended or requested and subsequently denied.  As with the first subpoena, this second one requests documents from January 1, 1999 to the present.

On October 6, 2003, the Company issued a press release stating that People's Health Network had received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's office in New Orleans seeking certain records from January 1, 1999 to the present.
