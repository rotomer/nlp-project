On January 28, 2005, Tenet Healthcare Corporation closed a
private placement offering of $800 million of 9.25% senior notes due 2015.  The company priced the notes at 98.406% of par.  Tenet intends to use the proceeds of the offering to repurchase or redeem its remaining outstanding senior notes due in 2006 and 2007, and for general corporate purposes.  In connection with its offering, Tenet and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), entered into a supplemental indenture (the "Eighth Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture dated as of November 6, 2001 (the "Indenture"), between Tenet and the Trustee.  The covenants under the Indenture and Eighth Supplemental Indenture governing the new issue are identical to the covenants governing Tenet's other outstanding bond issues.  The Eighth Supplemental Indenture will be attached as an exhibit to Tenet's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
