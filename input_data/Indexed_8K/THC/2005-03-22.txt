ITEM 1.01       Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
                On March 16, 2005, Tenet Healthcare Corporation amended its one-year letter of credit facility.  Tenet originally entered into the letter of credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letter of credit issuing bank, and Citicorp USA, Inc., as syndication agent and risk participant in letters of credit, on December 31, 2004.  The facility provides for the issuance of up to $250 million in letters of credit.  Tenet maintains ordinary banking and investment banking relationships with both Bank of America and Citicorp USA and their affiliates.
 
                Prior to its amendment, the letter of credit facility was collateralized by the stock of certain of Tenet's subsidiaries and by cash equal to 105% of the facility.  Under the amended letter of credit facility, the lenders have agreed to release their liens on the stock of Tenet's subsidiaries, at Tenet's request any time after April 15, 2005, so long as no default exists. At the time of such release, the termination date of the letter of credit facility will be extended from December 31, 2005 to June 30, 2006. The facility will remain collaterized by cash as described above.
 
                A copy of the definitive amended letter of credit facility is attached as Exhibit 10.1.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
