Item 8.01     Other Events.
 
On August 25, 2005, Tenet Healthcare Corporation received a notice of default from holders of $139,850,000 principal amount of Tenet's outstanding 6 7/8 percent Senior Notes due 2031 (the "Notes") (a total of $450,000,000 principal of the Notes is outstanding).  The notice, delivered pursuant to the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, asserts that Tenet's failure to timely file with the Securities and Exchange Commission its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 and to provide a copy of the filed 10-Q to the Trustee under the Indenture within fifteen days of the filing deadline of August 9, 2005, constitutes a default under Section 704 of the Indenture.  The effect of the notice is to commence a 90-day cure period, extending through Nov. 23, 2005, during which time the company avoids an event of default by filing the Form 10-Q.
 
The company believes that it will be able to cure the default by filing the 10-Q within the 90-day cure period.  If the default is not cured by that time, the Bond holders may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be due and payable immediately by giving written notice to the company and the Trustee.  That action could trigger a cross default under the company's other outstanding bond issuances.  The company announced on July 20, 2005, that it expected a delay in the filing of the Form 10-Q.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
