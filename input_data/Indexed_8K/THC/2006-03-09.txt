As disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on January 19, 2006, Tenet Healthcare Corporation (the "Company"), as a result of an independent accounting investigation, determined that it was necessary to restate its financial statements for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the seven-month transition period ended December 31, 2002, and the calendar years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, and that these financial statements should no longer be relied upon.  The approximate impact of the restatement adjustments anticipated at the time of filing was disclosed in the Form 8-K.
 
As disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on February 22, 2006, the Company concluded that a $120 million component of a $744 million deferred tax valuation allowance previously charged against additional paid-in capital was incorrect and should have been recorded as income tax expense in the Company's 2004 income statement.  As a result, the Company's 2004 financial statements should no longer be relied upon for that reason.  The Company has determined that this adjustment does not impact its previously reported quarterly reports for 2005.
 
On March 1, 2006, the audit committee determined that, due to additional adjustments resulting from the final independent accounting investigation report, it was necessary to further restate our financial statements for 2004 and periods back to and including the fiscal year ended May 31, 1999.  The additional adjustments relate to $39 million of prior period reserves released during 2003 and $14 million of prior period reserves released during 2004 that should have been released as of 2002 or earlier.  Such prior period reserves relate primarily to reserves for bad debts, cost report settlements, lease costs, litigation costs, restructuring charges and other reserves related to business combinations and acquisitions and sales of assets and facilities, and previously capitalized start-up costs.
 
Since the financial statements for the calendar year ended December 31, 2004 are being restated for these adjustments, the Company recorded audit differences that were previously deemed immaterial for 2004.  These audit differences related to estimated professional and general liability reserves that were not adequately decreased by $22 million as of December 31, 2004, and other adjustments related to the investigation.   On March 1, 2006, the audit committee also determined that the impact of the 2004 audit differences on our 2005 quarterly periods necessitates a restatement of our previously reported financial statements for the 2005 quarterly periods.   As a result of the foregoing, the Company's previously reported financial statements for the 2005 quarterly periods should also no longer be relied upon.
 
The applicable restated financial results are included in the Company's 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K, also filed today, and Form 10-Q/As for the 2005 quarterly periods, to be subsequently filed, and the impact of all of the restatement adjustments described above follows:
