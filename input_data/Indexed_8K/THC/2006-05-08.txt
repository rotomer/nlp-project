Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) today issued the following statement regarding a news release issued Monday afternoon by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services saying that the OIG may seek to exclude Alvarado Hospital Medical Center in San Diego and the Tenet subsidiary that owns the hospital from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs.
DALLAS  May 8, 2006 
 
"We have explained to the OIG that excluding this hospital from the Medicare program would be unfair and unwarranted. It could ultimately force Alvarado Hospital Medical Center to close, thus eliminating the jobs of hundreds of health care workers and reducing needed access to care for the communities of eastern San Diego County."
 
"We have been attempting in good faith to resolve the Alvarado matter with the federal government. We believe that nothing in the hospital's practice of recruiting physicians to eastern San Diego County warrants a forced sale or closure of the hospital  especially given the lack of any evidence that any physician compromised his or her medical judgment when referring a patient to Alvarado. Two trials in San Diego have ended after both juries deadlocked on whether anyone at
 
Alvarado intended to violate the law regarding physician relocation agreements. Despite this unfortunate action by the OIG, we will continue to discuss an overall resolution and we hope to reach an equitable result."
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates acute care hospitals and related health care services. Tenet's hospitals aim to provide the best possible care to every patient who comes through their doors, with a clear focus on quality and service.
