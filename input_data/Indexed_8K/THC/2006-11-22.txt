Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) announced today that it has reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve certain disputed issues in connection with the audit of its tax returns for the fiscal years 1995, 1996 and 1997.  As part of the settlement, the company said it expects to make a payment in the fourth quarter of 2006 of approximately $80 million representing taxes and interest owed under the settlement.
DALLAS  Nov. 22, 2006 
The company expects the settlement announced today will not have a material impact on income from continuing or discontinued operations after taking into account the impact of the deferred tax valuation allowance.
As the company has previously disclosed, the IRS issued a notice of tax deficiency in 2003 for the fiscal years 1995 through 1997, and Tenet filed a petition to contest the alleged deficiency in U.S. Tax Court.  The settlement announced today relates to the deductibility of a portion of a civil settlement Tenet had paid to the federal government in 1994 as well as the amount of tax depreciation expense claimed with respect to certain capital expenditures incurred during fiscal years 1995 through 1997.
Tenet said one issue remains to be resolved with the IRS from the audit of fiscal years 1995
through 1997.  That remaining issue relates to the timing of the deductibility of certain contributions to the company's health and welfare benefit plans.  Tenet said it is working with the IRS to resolve the issue without litigation.  It is expected that the ultimate resolution of this remaining issue will involve a cash payment by Tenet to the IRS of no more than $5 million.
