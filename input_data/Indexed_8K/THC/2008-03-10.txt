DALLAS  March 7, 2008 
After resolving numerous difficult and complex legal issues, Peter Urbanowicz, General Counsel and Secretary of  Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC), is leaving the company to pursue opportunities outside of Tenet.
 
"In his four years with Tenet, Mr. Urbanowicz managed the company's resolution of issues with the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other civil matters facing the company," said Trevor Fetter, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Virtually all of Tenet's major litigation has been resolved, and we thank Peter for his efforts in getting us past those issues."
 
Mr. Urbanowicz joined Tenet in December 2003 after serving as a Deputy General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Before joining HHS, Urbanowicz worked in several New Orleans law firms in the area of healthcare regulatory law.
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates acute care hospitals and related ancillary health care businesses, which include ambulatory surgery centers and diagnostic imaging centers.  Tenet is committed to providing high quality care to patients in the communities we serve.  Tenet can be found on the World Wide Web at www.tenethealth.com.
