Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) today reported a net loss of $31 million, or $0.06 per share, for its first quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $75 million, or $0.16 per share, in the first quarter of 2007. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2008 was $234 million, an increase of 20.6 percent as compared to $194 million in the first quarter of 2007. Same-hospital adjusted EBITDA was $239 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of $45 million, or 23.2 percent, from $194 million reported in the first quarter of 2007. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP term defined and reconciled below to net income (loss) as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $10 million, or $0.02 per share, in the first quarter of 2008 which included a litigation charge of $30 million, after-tax, or $0.06 per share. Net income from continuing operations in our first quarter of 2007 was $91 million, or $0.19 per share, which included a favorable income tax adjustment of $84 million, or $0.18 per share.
DALLAS  May 6, 2008 
 
"The quarter represents the second consecutive quarter of positive admissions growth since early 2004," said Trevor Fetter, Tenet's president and chief executive officer. "And April admissions showed enhanced volume strength bringing admissions growth through the first four months of the year to 1.6 percent and moderating outpatient visits to a decline of just 0.1 percent. Beyond volume growth, strong pricing and effective cost control drove the Company's improved operating results, producing a 23 percent increase in same-hospital adjusted EBITDA. Our growth strategies are working, as evidenced by this strong financial performance, the success of our physician relationship effort, and increases in patient volumes in many of the service lines identified by our Targeted Growth Initiative. I am very pleased with the progress we've made."
Continuing Operations
The loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the first quarter of 2008 was $9 million compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of $7 million for the first quarter of 2007. These amounts included the following three items, which aggregated to a net pre-tax charge of $46 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared to net pre-tax income of $10 million in the first quarter of 2007.
 
 
 
Stock-based compensation expense, included in salaries, wages and benefits, was $10 million pre-tax, $6 million after-tax before a deferred tax valuation allowance, or $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $11 million pre-tax, $7 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2007.
 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2008 was $234 million producing a margin (as a percentage of net operating revenues) of 9.9 percent, an increase of $40 million, or 20.6 percent, from adjusted EBITDA of $194 million in the first quarter of 2007. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007. Same-hospital adjusted EBITDA was $239 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 23.2 percent from $194 million in the first quarter of 2007.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP term defined by the Company as net income (loss) before (1) the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax, (2) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, (3) income tax (expense) benefit, (4) net gains on sale of investments, (5) minority interests, (6) investment earnings, (7) interest expense, (8) litigation and investigation costs, (9) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs, (10) impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries, (11) amortization, and (12) depreciation. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to "Adjusted EBITDA" is provided in Table #1 at the end of this release.
Same-Hospital Data
Same-hospital data for the first quarter of 2008 excludes the impact of two hospitals: (1) Coastal Carolina Hospital which was acquired by Tenet on June 30, 2007, and (2) pre-opening expenses associated with our new hospital, Sierra Providence East Medical Center, El Paso, scheduled to open in May 2008.
Same-hospital data is used as the primary form of data presentation in the narrative sections of this press release.
Total-hospital data, including the contribution from Coastal Carolina Hospital and the impact of our new hospital in east El Paso is provided in the tabular presentation of data at the end of this press release.
As a result of this approach, certain amounts in the tables in the narrative section of this release will not tie to amounts in the consolidated statement of operations as the amounts in the narrative section represent "same-hospital" data, not consolidated data.
 
In the first quarter, Coastal Carolina Hospital generated $5 million in net operating revenues, a net loss of $3 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $3 million. Our new hospital in El Paso, Sierra Providence East Medical Center, generated no revenues, but recorded $2 million in pre-opening expenses, which reduced total Company adjusted EBITDA and increased the Company's net loss by $2 million.
 
Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries
 
 
 
Same-hospital admissions for the first quarter of 2008 were 145,715, an increase of 1,451 admissions, or 1.0 percentcompared to admissions of 144,264 in the first quarter of 2007. Admissions in the first quarter of 2008 benefited from the effects of 2008 being a leap year, a recently established affiliation with a local healthcare provider in Philadelphia, and an acquisition in Modesto, California.
,
Flu-related admissions were approximately 479 in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to 176 admissions in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding these flu-related admissions from both quarters, admissions increased 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007.
Same-hospital commercial managed care admissions declined from 40,615 to 39,095, a decline of 1,520 admissions, or 3.7 percent, in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to the first quarter of 2007. Same-hospital total managed care admissions, including both commercial and government programs, increased to 68,929, an increase of 1,524, or 2.3 percent, from 67,405 in the first quarter of 2007. This increase reflects the continuing shift from traditional government programs towards managed government programs.
The increase in patients qualifying for Medicaid in certain markets contributed to the 14.7 percent decline in charity admissions.
 
Outpatient Visits
 
 
Same-hospital outpatient visits in the first quarter of 2008 were 1,016,731, a decline of 11,266, or 1.1 percent, as compared to 1,027,997 visits in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding uninsured and charity outpatient visits, the number of visits declined by 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007.
A number of factors contributed to this decline, including the increasing competition the Company is experiencing from physician-owned entities providing outpatient services.
Flu-related outpatient visits increased to 4,765 in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to 1,642 in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding these flu-related visits, total outpatient visits declined by 1.4 percent.
 
Revenues
 
 
Same-hospital net operating revenues from continuing operations were $2.367 billion in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of $149 million, or 6.7 percent, as compared to $2.218 billion in the first quarter of 2007. This revenue growth is primarily a reflection of new, attractively priced commercial managed care contracts, and the impact of a 1.0 percent growth in admissions. Net operating revenues in the first quarter of 2008 include $6 million of revenue recognized by our Philadelphia hospitals related to calendar year 2007 that was approved for distribution to the Company in the first quarter of 2008 by a Philadelphia HMO in which we hold a minority interest.
Same-hospital net patient revenue from commercial managed care payors increased by $50 million, or 5.6 percent, in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. This increase reflects continued pricing increases sufficient to offset a decline in commercial managed care admissions of 3.7 percent and a decline in commercial managed care outpatient visits of 2.1 percent.
Same-hospital disproportionate-share revenue under various state Medicaid programs and other state-funded subsidies provided revenues of approximately $41 million and $40 million in the first quarters of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Disproportionate-share payments in the first quarter of 2008 include $4 million of retroactive funds recognized by the Company's Georgia
 
hospitals related to calendar year 2007 as a result of the state appropriating certain funds for private hospitals. Disproportionate-share payments are dependent on government programs, which are subject to periodic review and policy changes.
Pricing
 
Pricing improvement was evident across all key metrics. Same-hospital net inpatient revenue per admission for the first quarter of 2008 was $11,063 compared to $10,432 in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $631 per admission, or 6.0 percent. Same-hospital net outpatient revenue per visit was $670 in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $617 in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $53 per visit, or 8.6 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of $2 million and $12 million from prior year cost report and related valuation allowance adjustments from net patient revenues in the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, the increase in same-hospital net patient revenues per adjusted admission in the first quarter of 2008 would have been 6.0 percent and the increase in net patient revenues per adjusted patient day would have been 5.6 percent, both compared to the first quarter of 2007.
The Company disaggregates its managed care business into three categories: (1) commercial managed care, (2) managed Medicare, and (3) managed Medicaid. In the first quarter of 2008, approximately 75 percent of same-hospital managed care revenues were recognized from our commercial managed care business, 16 percent from managed Medicare, and 9 percent from managed Medicaid. In the first quarter of 2007 the Company recognized 77 percent of same-hospital managed care revenues from our commercial managed care business, 13 percent from managed Medicare, and 10 percent from managed Medicaid. In recent quarters
 
the Company has seen revenues from managed government programs grow more rapidly than the commercial portion of our managed care business. This mix shift reflects the migration to managed Medicare and Medicaid from traditional Medicare and Medicaid, which has characterized the healthcare sector nationwide. In the first quarter of 2008 same-hospital managed care admissions were approximately 57 percent commercial managed care, 23 percent managed Medicare, and 20 percent managed Medicaid compared to 60 percent, 20 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2007. Same-hospital managed care outpatient visits in the first quarter of 2008 were 70 percent commercial managed care, 11 percent managed Medicare, and 19 percent managed Medicaid compared to 72 percent, 10 percent, and 18 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2007.
For our aggregate managed care portfolio, including managed government programs, same- hospital net inpatient revenue per admission increased by 4.6 percent in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to the first quarter of 2007. Same-hospital net outpatient revenue per visit increased by 8.2 percent for our aggregate managed care portfolio in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to the first quarter of 2007.
Controllable Operating Expenses
 
The Company captured incremental efficiencies within its cost structure both from the benefits of significant cost reduction initiatives implemented in the last 12 months and the efficient flexing of operating costs in response to fluctuating patient volumes in our hospitals. Same-hospital controllable operating expenses (consisting of salaries, wages and benefits, supplies, rent/lease expense and other operating expenses) were $1.980 billion and $1.891 billion
 
in the first quarters of 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $89 million, or 4.7 percent. Same-hospital controllable operating expenses per adjusted patient day were $1,903 in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $1,855 in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $48 per adjusted patient day, or 2.6 percent.
Same-hospital salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $40 million, or 4.0 percent. This increase is primarily the result of merit increases provided to employees to maintain competitive wage rates in our markets. For the majority of our employees merit increases were effective October 1, 2007. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was moderated by a decline in the number of full-time equivalent employees. Contract labor expense, which is included in salaries, wages and benefits, declined by $5 million, or 8.8 percent, to $52 million in the first quarter of 2008 from $57 million in the first quarter of 2007.
Same-hospital supplies expense increased by $24 million, or 6.1 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2007. While total surgeries declined by 1.7 percent, we continue to experience an increase in surgeries that include implantable devices. The higher usage of implantable devices contributed to an increased implant expense of $11 million, or 10.9 percent.
Same-hospital "Other Operating Expenses" increased by $25 million, or 5.4 percent, to $488 million in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to $463 million in the first quarter of 2007. "Other Operating Expenses" includes medical malpractice expense of $43 million for the first quarter of 2008, a decline of $4 million, or 8.5 percent, from $47 million in the first quarter of 2007. Malpractice expense in the first quarter of 2008 includes $5 million of incremental expense related to the lower interest rate environment, which increased the discounted present value of projected future liabilities. In the first quarter of 2007, "Other Operating Expenses" were reduced by $7 million from the net gain on the sale of a medical office building in Florida and by $3 million related to a favorable property insurance adjustment.
Provision for Doubtful Accounts
 
 
 
Same-hospital provision for doubtful accounts, or bad debt expense, was $148 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of $15 million, or 11.3 percent, from the provision for doubtful accounts of $133 million in the first quarter of 2007. Bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2008 was reduced by $8 million due to a favorable settlement of a dispute with a managed care payor.
Same-hospital bad debt expense was 6.3 percent of net operating revenues in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 30 basis points as compared to 6.0 percent in the first quarter of 2007.
The increase in bad debt expense was largely the result of the growth in uninsured admissions, pricing increases, and improved charge capture in our emergency departments. These factors contributing to increased bad debt expense were partially offset by a 3.8 percent decline in uninsured outpatient visits.
Accounts Receivable
Consolidated accounts receivable were $1.468 billion at March 31, 2008, and $1.385 billion at December 31, 2007. Accounts receivable days outstanding for continuing operations were 54 days at March 31, 2008, unchanged from December 31, 2007.
Cash Flow
Cash and cash equivalents were $278 million at March 31, 2008, a decrease of $294 million from $572 million at December 31, 2007.
Significant cash disbursements in the first quarter of 2008 included:
 
 
 
 
 
Net cash used in operating activities was $133 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $154 million in the first quarter of 2007, an improvement of $21 million. In accordance with GAAP, this cash flow figure excludes capital expenditures, proceeds of asset sales, as well as certain other items. Key positive and negative factors contributing to the $21 million decline in cash used in operating activities in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007 include the following:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's cash flows from operating activities are typically lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year due to various factors, including the timing of payments for the annual 401(k) matching contribution, annual incentive compensation payments, and calendar year end expenditures paid in the first quarter, among other factors.
"Adjusted net cash used in operating activities  continuing operations" is a non-GAAP term defined by the Company as "net cash used in operating activities" of $133 million excluding: (1) an income tax refund of $1 million, (2) payments against reserves for restructuring charges of $27 million, and (3) net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations. Using this definition, adjusted net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $107 million for the first quarter of 2008. Adjusted net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2008 improved by $52 million, or 33 percent, from a net cash use of $159 million in the first quarter of 2007 using the same definition. A reconciliation of "Net cash used in operating activities" to "Adjusted net cash used in operating activities  continuing operations" is provided in Table #2 at the end of this release.
 
Total company capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2008 were $189 million, $188 million of which related to continuing operations. These capital expenditures included $23 million for the construction of our new El Paso hospital, Sierra Providence East Medical Center, and $6 million for the construction of a replacement hospital for our East Cooper Regional Medical Center in South Carolina. Capital expenditures related to continuing operations in the first quarter of 2007 were $108 million.
One significant cash flow item excluded from the calculation of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter of 2008 is the proceeds of approximately $23 million from the sale of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations, which primarily related to the sale of North Ridge Medical Center.
Liquidity
Total debt was $4.775 billion at March 31, 2008, an increase of $3 million from total debt on December 31, 2007, of $4.772 billion. Net debt, a non-GAAP measure defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents of $278 million at March 31, 2008, and $572 million at December 31, 2007, was $4.497 billion at March 31, 2008, and $4.200 billion at December 31, 2007.
Income Taxes
The income tax expense in the first quarter of 2008 related to continuing operations includes an income tax benefit of $8 million to reduce estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions and income tax expense of $6 million primarily related to changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments.
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2008 of $21 million, or $0.04 per share.

(1) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as net income (loss) before (1) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax, (2) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax , (3) income tax (expense) benefit, (4) net gains (losses) on sales of investments (5) minority interests, (6) investment earnings, (7) interest expense, (8) litigation and investigation (costs) benefit, (9) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs, (10) impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges, (11) amortization, and (12) depreciation. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies.
The Company provides this information as a supplement to GAAP information to assist itself and investors in understanding the impact of various items on its financial statements, some of which are recurring or involve cash payments. The Company uses this information in its analysis of the performance of its business excluding items that it does not consider as relevant in the performance of its hospitals in continuing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity, but is a measure of operating performance that management uses in its business as an alternative to net income (loss). Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes many items that are included in our financial statements, it does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's financial performance.
The reconciliation of net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP term, to Adjusted EBITDA, is set forth in the first table below for the three-months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007.
(2) Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures in continuing operations, new hospital construction expenditures, income tax refunds (payments), cash flows from discontinued operations, and payments against reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs and settlements. The Company believes the use of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is meaningful as the use of this financial measure provides the Company and the users of its financial statements with supplemental information about the impact on the Company's cash flows from the items specified above. The Company provides this information as a supplement to GAAP information to assist itself and investors in understanding the impact of various items on its cash flows, some of which are recurring. The Company uses this information in its analysis of its cash flows excluding items that it does not consider relevant to the liquidity of its hospitals in continuing operations. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a measure of liquidity that management uses in its business as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Because Adjusted Free Cash Flow excludes many items that are included in our financial statements, it does not provide a complete measure of our liquidity. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's financial performance or liquidity. The reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most comparable GAAP term, to Adjusted Free Cash Flow is set forth in the second table below for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007.
