On February 10, 2009, Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet" or the "Registrant") announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital to the University of Southern California. USC University Hospital is a 411-bed general acute care hospital located in Los Angeles, California, and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital is a 60-bed facility specializing in cancer treatment on the campus of USC University Hospital. In the quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Registrant reclassified both hospitals into discontinued operations based on the guidance in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." On the day the terms of the transaction were finalized and the definitive agreement was signed, management determined that it will be necessary to record material impairment charges related to the long-lived assets associated with those hospitals under generally accepted accounting principles in the Registrant's financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008. At this time, the Registrant expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $40 million, pre- and after-tax, in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter for the impairment. The impairment-related charge is not currently expected to result in material future cash expenditures.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
