Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) today reported a loss of $33 million, or $0.07 per share, for its fourth quarter of 2008, compared to a net loss of $75 million, or $0.16 per share, for its fourth quarter of 2007. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term defined below, was $199 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of $43 million, or 27.6 percent, as compared to $156 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. On a same-hospital basis, adjusted EBITDA was $201 million, an increase of $43 million, or 27.2 percent, as compared to $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
DALLAS  February 24, 2009 
For the year 2008, net income was $25 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $89 million, or $0.19 per share for 2007. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term defined below, was $732 million in 2008, compared to $657 million for 2007, an increase of $75 million, or 11.4 percent. The adjusted EBITDA margin for 2008 was 8.4 percent, an increase of 40 basis points from an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.0 percent in 2007.
"Growth in paying volumes remained positive despite the challenges of a severe decline in the economy in the fourth quarter. Paying admissions grew by 0.1 percent and paying outpatient visits grew by 0.9 percent. We are particularly gratified by this growth in our outpatient business which had experienced negative volume growth in recent years," said Trevor Fetter, president and chief executive officer. "We view this volume growth, in the context of a challenging economic environment, as compelling evidence that our strategies continue to prove effective in advancing the Company towards sustained profitability."
"Surgeries grew by a very strong 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, highlighting growth in a number of our higher priority, targeted service lines," said Stephen L. Newman, M.D., chief operating officer. "This growth can, in part, be attributed to our continued success at expanding our active medical staff. In 2008, our active medical staff grew by 1,122 physicians or 9.0 percent. As this growth is net of attrition, we believe this expansion of our medical staff could be an important leading indicator of continuing volume growth. Since the beginning of 2007, we have grown the number of physicians on our active medical staff by 17.0 percent."
"Both our fourth quarter and full year results benefited from continued strong pricing and solid cost control," said Biggs C. Porter, chief financial officer. "We constrained growth in same-hospital controllable operating expense per adjusted patient day to just 0.8 percent. This focus on cost control made a significant contribution to improved profitability in the quarter, with our adjusted EBITDA margin rising to 9.1 percent. Our progress on pricing and cost efficiencies is expected to provide continuing benefits into 2009 including incremental cost efficiencies, which we expect to total approximately $150 million by year end. Although we now expect there may be increasing pressure on bad debt and commercial volumes in 2009, our outlook for 2009 adjusted EBITDA is in the range of $735 million to $800 million."
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term defined below, was $199 million, or a margin of 9.1 percent of net operating revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2008. This represents an increase of $43 million, or 27.6 percent, from adjusted EBITDA of $156 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, and margin increase of 160 basis points as compared to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Same-hospital adjusted EBITDA was $201 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of $43 million, or 27.2 percent, from the $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Same-hospital adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 170 basis points to 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the same-hospital adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. For 2008, same-hospital adjusted EBITDA was $752 million, an increase of $93 million, or 14.1 percent, as compared to $659 million for 2007.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP term defined by the Company as net income (loss) before: (1) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax; (2) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (3) income tax (expense) benefit; (4) net gains (losses) on sales of investments; (5) minority interests; (6) investment earnings; (7) interest expense; (8) litigation and investigation (costs) benefit, net of insurance recoveries; (9) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs; (10) impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries; (11) amortization; and (12) depreciation. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA is provided in Table #1 at the end of this release.
Same-Hospital Data
Same-hospital continuing operations data excludes two hospitals: (1) Coastal Carolina Medical Center, which we acquired on June 30, 2007; and (2) Sierra Providence East Medical Center, in El Paso, which opened on May 21, 2008. Same-hospital continuing operations data is the primary form of tabular data presentation in the narrative sections of this document. There are currently 48 hospitals in same-hospital continuing operations. The Company intends to add Coastal Carolina Medical Center to same-hospital continuing operations beginning on January 1, 2009.
 
Total-hospital data, including the contribution of Coastal Carolina Medical Center and Sierra Providence East Medical Center, is provided in the tabular presentation of data at the end of this document. As a result of this approach, certain amounts in the narrative section of this document will not tie to amounts in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries
 
 
Our Florida and Central Regions achieved the strongest admissions growth in the quarter and our Central Region achieved fourth quarter growth that outperformed all but its third quarter results. Our California Region experienced a decline in admissions in the fourth quarter, which was its only quarter of negative growth in 2008. Both our Southern States Region and our Philadelphia Market had admissions declines in the fourth quarter.
While total same-hospital admissions declined by 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, paying admissions grew by 0.1 percent. There was a 4.6 percent decline in uninsured and charity admissions.
Commercial managed care admissions declined by 3.0 percent relative to the fourth quarter of 2007, but improved its trend relative to the 3.4 percent decline reported in the third quarter of 2008. A decline in obstetrics volumes accounted for 58 percent of our decline in commercial admissions in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to commercial admissions in the fourth quarter of 2007. Under our Targeted Growth Initiative we have deemphasized the obstetrics service line in a significant number of our hospitals.
Surgery growth remained strong supported by growth in outpatient surgeries of 3.7 percent. Inpatient surgeries were flat relative to the fourth quarter of 2007. Our Targeted Growth Initiative brought incremental focus to a number of the service lines that contributed to this growth in surgeries.
 
Outpatient Visits
 
While total same-hospital outpatient visits declined by 0.3 percent, paying outpatient visits (excluding uninsured and charity outpatient visits) increased by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Competition from physician-owned enterprises offering outpatient services continues to restrain our growth in outpatient volumes.
Our recent acquisitions of outpatient facilities added 2,053 outpatient visits in the fourth quarter of 2008. This source of increased outpatient visits was more than offset by 3,928 lost visits resulting from recent divestitures and the joint venturing of some of our existing outpatient facilities where Tenet has taken a minority interest. Excluding the impact of this resultant net loss of 1,875 outpatient visits from acquisitions and divestitures, outpatient visits in the fourth quarter of 2008 would have declined by 1,212 visits, or 0.1 percent.
Revenues
 
Net operating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 include $8 million from the partial reversal of a $17 million unfavorable adjustment recorded in the second quarter of 2008 related to a graduate medical education reimbursement dispute at one of our California hospitals. Excluding this $8 million from net operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008, net operating revenues would have increased by $94 million, or 4.5 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. As the charge reversal was recorded in "Other Revenue", our fourth quarter 2008 patient pricing statistics were unaffected.
Prior-year cost report adjustments contributed $2 million to net operating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008. Prior-year cost report adjustments made no material contribution to net operating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Pricing
 
Pricing improvement was evident across all key metrics, primarily reflecting the improved terms of our commercial managed care contracts. Outpatient pricing again outpaced the growth in inpatient pricing due to an improving mix of procedures performed in our outpatient facilities. Our investment and development of higher-end procedures in both the surgery and imaging segments of our outpatient business, as well as recent acquisitions, have contributed to this improving mix.
Controllable Operating Expenses
 
On a per adjusted patient day basis, salaries, wages and benefits increased 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, and increased health benefits costs, partially offset by a decline in full-time employee headcount, reduced contract labor expense, and improved worker's compensation loss experience, and lower incentive compensation costs. Contract labor expense, which is included in salaries, wages and benefits, was $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a decrease of $6 million, or 16.7 percent, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.
Supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in supplies expense is primarily due to the increased number of surgeries as well as the costs of certain new, higher cost drugs. A portion of the increase in supplies expense is offset by revenue growth related to pass-through payments we receive from certain payers.
"Other Operating Expenses" per adjusted patient day decreased by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in this decrease was a significant decline in malpractice expense. On a total hospital basis, malpractice expense declined from $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a decline of $18 million, or 50.0 percent. This decrease is primarily attributable to improved claims experience and was partially offset by $4 million of incremental expenses related to a lower interest rate environment that increased the discounted present value of projected future liabilities. The
 
favorable impact of declining malpractice expense was partially offset by increases in other items including higher physician fees reflecting increases in Emergency Department on-call payments, increases in costs of contracted services, as well as repair and maintenance costs. Declining consulting costs also had a favorable impact on "Other Operating Expenses."
Provision for Doubtful Accounts
 
Bad debt expense increased by $30 million, or 22.6 percent, despite declines in uninsured admissions and outpatient visits of 5.9 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively. The increase in bad debt expense resulted from the decline in our self-pay collection rate which declined to approximately 33 percent from 35 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, higher pricing, higher patient insurance deductibles, and a favorable adjustment to bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 which did not recur.
Accounts Receivable
Consolidated accounts receivable were $1.337 billion at December 31, 2008, and $1.356 billion at September 30, 2008. Accounts receivable days outstanding from continuing operations were 50 days at December 31, 2008, compared to 51 days at September 30, 2008 and 52 days at December 31, 2007.
Cash Flow
Cash and cash equivalents were $507 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $5 million from $512 million at September 30, 2008. Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP term defined below, was negative $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to negative $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less (1) capital expenditures in continuing operations, (2) new and replacement hospital construction expenditures, (3) income tax refunds (payments), (4) net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations, and (5) payments against reserves for restructuring charges, litigation costs and settlements. The reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most comparable GAAP term, to Adjusted Free Cash Flow is provided in Table #2 at the end of this release.
Significant cash flow items in the fourth quarter of 2008 included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook for 2009
The Company's outlook for 2009 is materially dependent on a number of items which are difficult to project given the uncertain macro-economic environment. Among the most important of these items are aggregate patient volumes, payer and patient mix, and bad debt expense.
As a basis for our 2009 Outlook, we have assumed same-hospital admissions growth of approximately flat to one percent, and same-hospital outpatient visit growth of flat to one percent. In 2008, same-hospital admissions grew by 1.2 percent and same-hospital outpatient visits declined by 0.1 percent.
Based on these volume assumptions, the 2009 outlook for growth in net operating revenues is in the range of 4 to 6 percent. This is consistent with an outlook for total-company net operating revenues in the range $9.0 billion to $9.2 billion. Total-company net operating revenues were $8.663 billion in 2008 representing growth of 6.1 percent over 2007, or growth of 5.6 percent on a same-hospital basis.
The outlook for growth in controllable operating expenses per adjusted patient day is in the range of 2 to 3 percent for 2009. This compares to 2.6 percent growth in same-hospital controllable operating expenses per adjusted patient day in 2008. On a total-company basis, this corresponds to an expected range for 2009 controllable operating expenses of $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion. Our 2009 outlook reflects the Company's expectations for continued cost efficiencies, including the Company's recent initiatives targeting a reduction of approximately $150 million in gross cost savings and the favorable impact of enhanced operating leverage that is expected to result from the assumed growth in patient volumes.
The 2009 outlook for total-company bad debt expense is in the range of 8.3 to 9.3 percent of net operating revenues, or total company bad debt expense in the range of $750 million to $850 million. In 2008, total-company bad debt expense was $632 million, or 7.3 percent of net operating revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2008, total-company bad debt ratio was 7.6 percent.
Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP term reconciled to net loss as defined by GAAP in Table #3 at the end of this release) is expected to be in the range of $735 million to $800 million in 2009, on a total-company basis. Based on the outlook for net operating revenues cited above, this corresponds to an adjusted EBITDA margin range of 8.2 to 8.7 percent. In 2008, Tenet's adjusted EBITDA was $732 million, for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.4 percent.
The outlook for depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 is approximately $400 million to $420 million, and the 2009 outlook for interest expense is approximately $450 million to $470 million, net of investment earnings and minority interest. This estimate of 2009 interest expense includes an estimated impact from Tenet's note exchange offer of $50 million to $60 million. The note exchange offer has an anticipated completion date of early March.
Tenet's 2009 outlook for income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes ranges from a loss of $15 million to income of $135 million. Excluding four items in Table #3 at the end of this release ((1)net gains (losses) on sales of investment; (2) litigation and investigation costs; (3) gain on exchange of long-term debt; (4) impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges), the 2009 outlook for loss from continuing operations before income taxes ranges from a loss of $135 million to a loss of $70 million. Using an assumption of 37.1 percent for normalized 2009 income taxes, results in an income tax benefit of $50 million to $26 million and average expected shares outstanding of 484 million, the 2009 outlook for normalized loss per share from continuing operations, after excluding the items listed in Table 3 at the end of this release, is in the range of a loss $0.18 to a loss of $0.09 per share.
 
The Company's 2009 Outlook includes an expectation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to be in the range of $240 million to $315 million, which the Company defines to exclude income tax payments/refunds, litigation and restructuring payments, and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations are expected to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million in 2009.
Adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations for 2009 (based on adjustments provided in Table 4 at the end of this release) is expected to be in the range of negative $160 million to $135 million.
The outlook range for cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 is $450 million to $550 million. This assumes the sale of USC Hospital and other cash initiatives aggregating to approximately $308 million to $343 million.
A reconciliation of outlook adjusted EBITDA to outlook net income (loss) for year ending December 31, 2009 is provided in Table 3; and a reconciliation of outlook adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, and outlook adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations to outlook net cash provided by operating activities for the year ending December 31, 2009 is provided in Table 4 at the end of this release.

(1) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as net income (loss) before (1) cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax, (2) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, (3) income tax (expense) benefit, (4) net gain (loss) on sales of investments, (5) minority interests, (6) investment earnings, (7) interest expense, (8) litigation and investigation (costs) benefit, net of insurance recoveries, (9) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs, (10) impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries, (11) amortization, and (12) depreciation. The Company's adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies.
The Company provides this information as a supplement to GAAP information to assist itself and investors in understanding the impact of various items on its financial statements, some of which are recurring or involve cash payments. The Company uses this information in its analysis of the performance of its business excluding items that it does not consider as relevant in the performance of its hospitals in continuing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity, but is a measure of operating performance that management uses in its business as an alternative to net income (loss). Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes many items that are included in our financial statements, it does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's financial performance.
The reconciliation of net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP term, to adjusted EBITDA, is set forth in the first table below for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.
(2) Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures in continuing operations, new and replacement hospital construction expenditures, income tax refunds (payments)  net, payments against reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs and settlements, and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is meaningful as the use of this financial measure provides the Company and the users of its financial statements with supplemental information about the impact on the Company's cash flows from the items specified above. The Company provides this information as a supplement to GAAP information to assist itself and investors in understanding the impact of various items on its cash flows, some of which are recurring. The Company uses this information in its analysis of its cash flows excluding items that it does not consider relevant to the liquidity of its hospitals in continuing operations going forward. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a measure of liquidity that management uses in its business as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Because Adjusted Free Cash Flow excludes many items that are included in our financial statements, it does not provide a complete measure of our liquidity. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's financial performance or liquidity. The reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most comparable GAAP term, to Adjusted Free Cash Flow is set forth in the second table below for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.
