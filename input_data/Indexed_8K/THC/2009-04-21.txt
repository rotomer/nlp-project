Earnings per share attributable to shareholders are expected to be approximately 37 cents, compared to a loss per share of 6 cents in the first quarter of 2008, a favorable increase of approximately 43 cents. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term defined below, is expected to be approximately $275 million, compared to $215 million in the first quarter of 2008, or an expected increase of approximately 28 percent. The gain on the debt exchange is not included in estimated adjusted EBITDA.
DALLAS  April 21, 2009 
"Excellent cost control, including a sustained decline in malpractice expense, contributed to a very strong first quarter and the highest operating margin we've reported in six years," said Trevor Fetter, president and chief executive officer. "Based on this strong start and our success at driving improved results despite a soft economic environment, we are very pleased to raise our earnings outlook for 2009."
Same-hospital admissions declined by approximately 1.3 percent and same-hospital commercial managed care admissions declined by approximately 3.2 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2008. After adjusting these percentage changes for the Leap Year effect resulting from 90 days in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 91 days in the first quarter of 2008, total admissions were approximately flat and commercial managed care admissions declined by approximately 2.0 percent.
Same-hospital outpatient visits increased by approximately 0.7 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2008, or approximately 1.8 percent after adjusting for the Leap Year effect. Commercial managed care outpatient visits declined by approximately 1.5 percent, or approximately 0.4 percent after adjusting for the Leap Year effect. Tenet expects revenues for the first quarter of 2009 to be approximately $2.280 billion compared to $2.178 billion in the first quarter of 2008, or an expected increase of approximately 4.7 percent.
Controllable operating expenses, consisting of salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses, are expected to be approximately $1.850 billion, compared to $1.816 billion in the first quarter of 2008, an expected increase of approximately 1.9 percent. Same-hospital controllable operating expenses per adjusted patient day are expected to increase approximately 1.2 percent compared to the first quarter of 2008. Bad debt expense is expected to be approximately $155 million, or approximately 6.8 percent of expected net operating revenues, in the first quarter of 2009, an expected increase of approximately 10 basis points compared to 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2008.
Cash and cash equivalents were $652 million at March 31, 2009, an increase of $145 million from December 31, 2008. This increase is primarily due to the receipt of $247 million in cash from the sale of USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital, partially offset by seasonal increases in cash payments. Capital expenditures in continuing operations were $101 million in the first quarter of 2009.
Tenet raised its outlook for 2009 adjusted EBITDA to the range of $760 million to $825 million, an increase of $25 million compared to the prior range of $735 million to $800 million. Its outlook for 2009 net income (loss) attributable to shareholders is a range between a loss of $55 million to net income of $75 million. A reconciliation of outlook adjusted EBITDA to outlook net income (loss) attributable to shareholders for the year ending December 31, 2009 is provided in Table #2 below.
Tenet will release complete first quarter results including the filing of its Form 10-Q on May 5, 2009.
Net income attributable to shareholders is expected to be approximately $178 million in the first quarter of 2009 or $0.37 per share, including the following items with an aggregate, net favorable impact of $141 million after-tax or $0.29 per share:
