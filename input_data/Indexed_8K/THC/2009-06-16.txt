The information in Item 2.03 is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
On June 15, 2009, Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet") sold $925,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the "Notes"). The Notes were offered only to eligible purchasers through a private placement and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities laws. Tenet will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually, in arrears, on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010, to holders of record on the immediately preceding December 15 and June 15. The Notes will rank equally with Tenet's 9.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2015 and 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2018. The Notes are guaranteed by and secured by a first-priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of Tenet's subsidiaries.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 6, 2001, as supplemented by an Eleventh Supplemental Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") dated June 15, 2009, among Tenet, certain of its subsidiaries and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee to The Bank of New York. The Supplemental Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Tenet's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries: to incur liens; consummate asset sales; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets, other than in certain transactions between one or more of Tenet's wholly owned subsidiaries and Tenet. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In particular, there are no restrictions on Tenet's ability or the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, enter into transactions with affiliates or make advances to, or invest in, other entities (including unaffiliated entities).
The Supplemental Indenture also provides that the Notes may become subject to redemption under certain circumstances, including a change of control (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) of Tenet. In addition, the Supplemental Indenture provides that, after July 1, 2014, Tenet may, at its option, redeem the Notes at the redemption prices and subject to terms set forth in the Supplemental Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date.
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on June 15, 2009 Tenet also entered into (i) a Second Amendment to Stock Pledge Agreement (the "Second Amendment to the Pledge Agreement") with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as collateral trustee, and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, which sets forth the terms under which Tenet has pledged the stock of certain of its subsidiaries, and (ii) an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement (the "Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement") with Banc of America Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as the Initial Purchasers for the benefit of the holders defined therein, and the guarantors party thereto, which sets forth Tenet's obligations to register the Notes under the Securities Act if the Notes have not become freely tradable (as defined in the agreement) on or before June 30, 2010.
The foregoing is a summary and is qualified by reference to the Supplemental Indenture, the Second Amendment to the Pledge Agreement, and the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed hereto as Exhibits 4.1, 10.1, and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
On June 15, 2009, Tenet issued a press release announcing the completion of the offering and issuance of the Notes. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Also on June 15, 2009, Tenet purchased $891.4 million of the $1 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 9.875% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "9.875% Senior Notes"). The 9.875% Senior Notes purchased by Tenet were validly
 
tendered pursuant to a cash tender offer (the "Tender Offer") prior to the expiration of the early tender time of 5:00 pm (New York City time) on June 11, 2009. The terms of the Tender Offer are contained in an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal, each dated as of May 29, 2009.
Tenet purchased the 9.875% Senior Notes for total consideration of $931,505,844, representing $891,405,000 in principal payments and $40,100,844 in accrued and unpaid interest through the date of purchase. Tenet purchased the 9.875% Senior Notes with the net proceeds from its offering of the Notes (estimated to be $864,033,250) and cash on hand.
Holders of 9.875% Senior Notes validly tendered after the early tender time but on or prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer and accepted by Tenet will receive total consideration of $970 per $1,000 principal amount of 9.875% Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the final settlement date, which Tenet expects to occur promptly following the expiration of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer will expire at 12:00 midnight (New York City time) on June 25, 2009. Tenet expects to fund the purchase of any additional 9.875% Senior Notes with cash on hand.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, the Company and such Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with the preceding paragraph except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions subject to the preceding paragraph which is not applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph exceeds $100.0 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.6, such Net Available Cash may be used in any other manner not prohibited by the Indenture.
For purposes of this Section 4.6, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents:
(1) the assumption or discharge of Debt or other liabilities of ours or any Subsidiary and the release of us or such Subsidiary from all liability on such Debt or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;
(2) securities or other obligations received by us or any Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by us or such Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the Asset Disposition, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and
(3) Additional Assets.
In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt), the Company will purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer by the Company for the Notes (and such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Special Interest, if any (or, in respect of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt, such other price, not to exceed 100%, as may be provided for by the terms of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt), in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in Section 3.3 hereof. If there remains a balance of Net Available Cash after purchasing all securities tendered, then such balance may be used in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company will select the securities to be purchased on a basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of $2,000 principal amount or any greater integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.The Company shall not be required to make such an Asset Disposition Offer to purchase Notes (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) pursuant to this Section 4.6 if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than $100.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an Asset Disposition Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an Asset Disposition Offer, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such Asset Disposition Offer.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.6.

Section 8.4.
Additional First-Priority Stock Secured Debt
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the other Stock Lien Security Documents, the Company may incur additional First-Priority Stock Secured Debt by issuing Additional Notes under the Indenture or issuing or increasing any other Series of First-Priority Stock Secured Debt. All additional First-Priority Stock Secured Debt will be with the Notes and will be secured by the Collateral equally and ratably with the Notes for as long as the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by the Collateral. The additional First-Priority Stock Secured Debt will only be permitted to be secured by the Collateral if such Debt and the related Liens are permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, including Section 4.1 hereof.
pari passu
The Collateral Trust Agreement sets forth the procedures pursuant to which an additional series of Debt can become an additional Series of First-Priority Stock Secured Debt that is entitled to be secured equally and ratably with the Notes by the Liens on the Collateral granted to the Collateral Trustee. The Indenture and all future First-Priority Stock Lien Documents will be required to provide that, notwithstanding (i) anything to the contrary contained in the Stock Lien Security Documents; (ii) the time of incurrence of any Series of First-Priority Stock Secured Debt; (iii) the order or method of attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any Series of First-Priority Stock Secured Debt; (iv) the time or order of filing or recording of financing statements or other documents filed or recorded to perfect any Lien upon any Collateral; (v) the time of taking possession or control over any Collateral; (vi) that any First-Priority Stock Lien may not have been perfected or may be or have become subordinated, by equitable subordination or otherwise, to any other Lien; or (vii) the rules for determining priority under any law governing relative priorities of Liens:
(1) all First-Priority Stock Liens granted at any time by the Company or any other Pledgor secure, equally and ratably, all present and future First-Priority Stock Secured Obligations; and
(2) all Proceeds of all First-Priority Stock Liens granted at any time by the Company or any other Pledgor will be allocated and distributed equally and ratably on account of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and other First-Priority Stock Secured Obligations.
 
The First-Priority Stock Lien Representative of each future Series of First-Priority Stock Secured Debt shall be required to deliver a Collateral Trust Joinder to the Collateral Trustee at the time of incurrence of such Series of First-Priority Stock Secured Debt, and the Company shall promptly provide the Trustee with a copy of each such Collateral Trust Joinder; , that the failure to so deliver a copy of such Collateral Trust Joinder to the Trustee shall not affect the status of such future Debt as First-Priority Stock Secured Debt if the other requirements contained in the Collateral Trust Agreement in connection with the incurrence of additional Secured Debt are complied with.
provided, however
The Company may also incur new or additional Junior Stock Secured Debt in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Collateral Trust Agreement.

Any certificate or opinion required by TIA 314(d) may be made by an Officer of the Company except in cases where TIA 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent Person, which Person will be an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert selected or reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.5(a), the Company shall not be required to comply with all or any portion of TIA 314(d) if it determines, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of TIA 314(d) and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the Commission and its staff, including "no action" letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of TIA 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a series of released Collateral.
Section 8.6.
Collateral Trustee
(a) The Company has appointed The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. to serve as the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of, among others, the Holders of the Notes, the holders of the Existing Secured Notes and the holders of future Stock Secured Obligations.
(b) The Collateral Trustee (directly or through co-trustees or agents) holds and will continue to hold, and is entitled to and will continue to be entitled to enforce, all Liens on the Collateral created by the Stock Lien Security Documents.
(c) Except as provided in the Stock Lien Security Documents, Collateral Trust Agreement or as directed by an Act of Required Stock Secured Debtholders, the Collateral Trustee is not nor will it be obligated:
(1) to act upon directions purported to be delivered to it by any Person in respect of the Collateral;

Section 8.7.
Further Assurances

(b) The Company and each of the Pledgors shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver such security documents, instruments, certificates, notices and other documents, and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to create, perfect, protect, assure or enforce the Liens and benefits intended to be conferred, in each case as contemplated by the Stock Secured Debt Documents for the benefit of the holders of Stock Secured Obligations.
Section 9.1.
Guarantee
(a) Subject to this Article Nine, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the Obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:
(1) the principal of, premium and Special Interest, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at Maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other Obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
(2) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other Obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
(b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their Obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Note Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture.
 
(c) If any Holder, the Trustee or the Collateral Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee, Collateral Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full force and effect.
(d) Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any Obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all Obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the Maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five of the Existing Indenture (as amended hereby) for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article Five of the Existing Indenture (as amended hereby), such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee. The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.
Section 9.2.
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
By its execution of this Eleventh Supplemental Indenture, each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the Obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article Nine, result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Section 9.3.
Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantee
To evidence its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 9.1 hereof, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit E hereto will be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Eleventh Supplemental Indenture will be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by one of its Officers.
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 9.1 hereof will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.
If an Officer whose signature is on this Eleventh Supplemental Indenture or on the Note Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Note Guarantee is endorsed, the Note Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantee set forth in this Eleventh Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
Section 9.4.
Guarantors May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain Terms
Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.5 hereof, no Guarantor shall, and the Company will not permit any Guarantor to, consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, and no Guarantor shall, and the Company will not permit any Guarantor to, permit any Person to consolidate with or merge into such Guarantor or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to such Guarantor, unless:

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing.
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person will succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Section 9.5.
Releases

(c) Upon liquidation and dissolution of any Guarantor in a transaction that is not prohibited by the Indenture, such Guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee.
(d) Upon Defeasance of the Notes in accordance with Article Six hereof or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture in accordance with Article Four of the Existing Indenture, each Guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee.
Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee as provided in this Section 9.5 will remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest and premium and Special Interest, if any, on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in this Article Nine.

The Company and each of the Guarantors represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Initial Purchasers and each of the holders from time to time of Registrable Securities that:
(a) Each registration statement covering Registrable Securities and each prospectus (including any preliminary or summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof and any further amendments or supplements to any such registration statement or prospectus, when it becomes effective or is filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and at all times subsequent to the Effective Time when a prospectus would be required to be delivered under the Securities Act, other than from (i) such time as a notice has been given to holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3(c)(iii)(F) hereof until (ii) such time as the Company furnishes an amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to Section 3(c)(iv) hereof, each such registration statement, and each prospectus (including any summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof, as then amended or supplemented, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein.
provided, however,
(b) Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus referred to in Section 5(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein.
provided, however,
(c) The compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with all of the provisions of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a material breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the articles of incorporation, as amended, or the bylaws of the Company; the certificate (or articles) of incorporation, certificate (or articles) of organization, certificate (or articles) of formation or

Indemnification
(a) The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an Exchange Registration Statement, and each person who participates as a placement or sales agent or as an underwriter in any offering or sale of such Registrable Securities against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder, agent or underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Exchange Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such holder, such agent and such underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any registration statement contemplated hereunder, or preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such person expressly for use therein.
Indemnification by the Company and the Guarantors.
provided, however,
(b) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) hereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
Notices of Claims, Etc.
 
expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(c) If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(c). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(c), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' obligations in this Section 6(c) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.
Contribution.
(d) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or any Guarantor (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or any Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
7. .
Rule 144
The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and shall take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.
8. .
Miscellaneous
(a) The Company and each Guarantor represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that it has not granted, and shall not grant, registration rights with respect to Registrable Securities or any other securities which would be inconsistent with the terms contained in this Agreement.
No Inconsistent Agreements.
(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that there would be no adequate remedy at law if the Company or any Guarantor fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder and that the Initial Purchasers and the holders from time to time of the Registrable Securities may be irreparably harmed by any such failure, and accordingly agree that the Initial Purchasers and such holders, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.
Specific Performance.
(c) All notices, requests, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered by hand, if delivered personally or by courier, or three days after being deposited in the mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested) as follows: If to the Company, to it at 13737 Noel Road, Dallas, Texas 75240, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, and if to a holder, to the address of such holder set forth in the security register or other records of the Company, or to such other address as the Company or any such holder may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
Notices.
(d) All the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and the holders from time to time of the Registrable Securities and the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto and such holders. In the event that any transferee of any holder of Registrable Securities shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any manner, whether by gift, bequest, purchase, operation of law or otherwise, such transferee shall, without any further writing or action of any kind, be deemed a beneficiary hereof for all purposes and such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such transferee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of, and be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by all of the applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement. If the Company shall so request, any such successor, assign or transferee shall agree in writing to acquire and hold the Registrable Securities subject to all of the applicable terms hereof.
Parties in Interest.
 
(e) The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and each other provision set forth in this Agreement or made pursuant hereto shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any holder of Registrable Securities, any director, officer or partner of such holder, any agent or underwriter or any director, officer or partner thereof, or any controlling person of any of the foregoing, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the transfer and registration of Registrable Securities by such holder and the consummation of an Exchange Offer.
Survival.
(f)
Governing Law.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

Each holder of any Registrable Securities at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any amendment or waiver effected pursuant to this Section 8(h), whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment or waiver appears on such Registrable Securities or is delivered to such holder.

% Senior Secured Notes due 2019. Tenet intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to purchase its 9.875% Senior Notes due 2014 in a tender offer. The notes were offered in a private placement.
The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
Some of the statements in this release may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by numerous factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and periodic reports on Form 8-K. Do not rely on any forward-looking statement, as we cannot predict or control many of the factors that ultimately may affect our ability to achieve the results estimated. We make no promise to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
