9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
 
fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
provided, however
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with
 
the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
pro rata
 
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of shares which such Underwriter agreed to
 
purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
pro rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representative at 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, facsimile
 
number (212) 902-3000, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company, or to any person referred in Section 8(o), shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided, however
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

(b) Dividends shall accrue and accumulate at such annual rate if the Corporation fails to pay one or more dividends in any amount, whether or not declared or the Corporation is then legally prohibited under Nevada law to pay such dividends. If declared, dividends shall be payable on the relevant Dividend Payment Date to the Holders of record of shares of the Preferred Stock as they appear on the Corporation's stock register at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend, whether or not such Holders convert their shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation elects to convert the shares at its option, or such shares of Preferred Stock are automatically converted, after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Record Date and prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Dividend Payment Date.

The initial dividend on the Preferred Stock for the first Dividend Period shall be $18.67 per share and will be payable, if declared, on January 1, 2010.

(d) For so long as the Preferred Stock is outstanding, no dividend shall be declared or paid upon, or funds set apart for the payment of any dividend or other distribution, whether in cash, obligations or shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation or other property, directly or indirectly, upon, any shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock, nor shall any shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock be redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through a sinking fund or otherwise, in each case unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, through, but not including, the most recent Dividend Payment Date on the shares of Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock have been paid in full or set apart for payment; that the Corporation may redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire for consideration Junior Stock or Parity Stock with Junior Stock and cash for fractional shares of such Junior Stock or Parity Stock. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of Preferred Stock, all dividends declared on the Preferred Stock and any other Parity Stock shall be paid pro rata so that the amount of dividends so declared on the shares of Preferred Stock and each such other class or series of Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio as accumulated dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock and such class or series of Parity Stock bear to each other. If dividends on the Preferred Stock are payable in Common Stock as set forth below and the Corporation is required to withhold on distributions of Common Stock to a Holder and the Corporation pays the applicable withholding taxes, the Corporation may, at its option, set off any such payment against payments of cash or shares of Common Stock payable to such Holder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock that the Corporation shall deliver in payment of all or a portion of a dividend as described above exceed a number equal to the dividend payment or portion thereof, as applicable, $1.95, which amount (the "") represents approximately onethird of the Initial Price, subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportional to any adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 11 hereof. To the extent that the amount of the declared dividend exceeds the product of the number of shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with such declared dividend and the Average Price, the Corporation shall, if it is legally able to do so, pay such excess amount in cash. In connection with a dividend payment made using any Common Stock, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be delivered to the holders of the Preferred Stock, but the Corporation shall instead pay a cash amount to each Holder that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Common Stock based on the Average Price. The Corporation shall not pay any portion of a dividend on the Preferred Stock in shares of Common Stock unless the shares of Common Stock to be issued and delivered may be publicly resold by Holders that are not "affiliates" (within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act) of the Corporation without registration under the Securities Act.

Conversion Rate Adjustments.
(a) If the Corporation issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a share split or share combination of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11(a) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date or the effective date of such share split or combination, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 11(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such split or combination, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
(b) If the Corporation issues to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock any rights, warrants, options or other securities entitling them (for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after the date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such rights, warrants, options or other securities) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, or if the Corporation issues to all holders of Common Stock securities convertible into Common Stock (for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after the date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such convertible securities), in either case at an exercise price per share of Common Stock or a conversion price per share of Common Stock less than the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-dividend Date for such issuance, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11(b) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date. For purposes of this Section 11(b), in determining whether any rights, warrants, options, convertible securities or other securities entitle the holders of Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase, or exercise a conversion right for, Common Stock at less than the applicable average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Corporation receives for such rights, warrants, options, convertible securities or other securities and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. If any rights, warrants, options, convertible securities or other securities described in this Section 11(b) are not so issued, the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights, warrants, options, convertible securities or other securities, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared. If any rights, warrants, options, convertible securities or other securities described in this Section 11(b) are not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the adjustments made upon the issuance of such right, warrant, option, convertible security or other securities had been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
(c) (i) If the Corporation distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or its other assets or property to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, excluding:
(A) dividends, distributions, rights, warrants, options, convertible securities or other securities as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 11(a) or (b) hereof,
(B) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and
(C) Spin-offs described in this Section 11(c),
then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this Section 11(c)(i) shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date.
(ii) If the Corporation distributes to all holders of Common Stock shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, and such shares of capital stock are listed for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation, and such shares of capital stock are listed for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange (a ""), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Spin-off
 
If the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in a fixed conversion rate, no adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate shall be made. An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this Section 11(c)(ii) shall occur on the final Trading Day of the Valuation Period; that in respect of any conversion of Preferred Stock within the ten consecutive Trading Days immediately following the date of the Spin-off, references with respect to the Spin-off to "ten consecutive Trading Day period" shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-off and the Mandatory Conversion Date, Optional Conversion Date or Reorganization Event Conversion Date, as applicable, in determining the applicable Fixed Conversion Rate.
provided
 
(iii) If any such dividend or distribution described in this Section 11(c) is declared by the Board of Directors but not paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(d) If the Corporation pays or makes any dividend or distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (other than (i) in connection with the Corporation's liquidation dissolution or winding up or (ii) payments with respect to tender or exchange offers described in Section 11(e) to the extent characterized as a dividend or distribution), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this Section 11(d) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date. If any dividend or distribution described in this Section 11(d) is declared but not so paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(e) If the Corporation or any Subsidiary makes a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for Common Stock (other than a tender offer solely to holders of fewer than 100 shares of Common Stock), to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
 
If the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in a Fixed Conversion Rate, no adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate shall be made. Any adjustment to a Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this Section 11(e) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the final Trading Day of the Tender Offer Valuation Period; that in respect of any conversion within the ten consecutive Trading Days next succeeding the Expiration Date, references with respect to "ten consecutive Trading Day period" shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Expiration Date and the Mandatory Conversion Date, Optional Conversion Date or Reorganization Event Conversion Date, as applicable, in determining the applicable Fixed Conversion Rate.
provided
If the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Corporation, or such Subsidiary, is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchase, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each new Fixed Conversation Rate shall be readjusted to be the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
(f) If the Corporation has in effect a rights plan while any shares of Preferred Stock remain Outstanding, Holders shall receive, upon a conversion of Preferred Stock, in addition to shares of Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan unless, prior to the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date, Optional Conversion Date or Reorganization Event Conversion Date, as the case may be, the
 
rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from Common Stock, in which case each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased at the time of separation as if the Corporation distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of the Corporation's Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property as described in Section 11(c) hereof, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 11, no adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to such adjustment on an as-converted basis and without converting their Preferred Stock.
(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 11, no adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate need be made if the Common Stock to be issued upon conversion will actually receive the consideration provided in, or be subject to, the transaction or event that would otherwise trigger the adjustment.
(i) No adjustment to a Fixed Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of a Fixed Conversion Rate then in effect; that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 11(i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made by the Corporation and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (

th) of a share, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all adjustments not previously made shall have effect with respect to any conversion of Preferred Stock.
(j) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation may (but are not required to) make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 11, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock (or rights or warrants to acquire Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation from time to time may increase each Fixed Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that such increase would be in the best interest of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive. The Corporation shall make such discretionary adjustments pursuant to this Section 11(j) only if the Corporation makes the same proportionate adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
(k) If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates, an inversely proportional adjustment also shall be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which clauses of the definition of the Conversion Rate shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date. Because (A) the Applicable Market Value is an average of the
 
Closing Prices of Common Stock over a 20 consecutive Trading Day period, (B) the Early Conversion Market Value is an average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over a 20 consecutive Trading Day period, (C) the Average Price is an average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over a five consecutive Trading Day period, and (D) unless the holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the Make-whole Event (in a single per share amount) the Make-whole Market Value is an average of the Closing Prices over a 10 consecutive Trading Day period, the Corporation shall make appropriate adjustments to the Closing Prices prior to the relevant Record Date, Make-whole Effective Date or Expiration Date, as the case may be, used to calculate the Applicable Market Value, the Average Price or the Make-whole Market Value, as the case may be, to account for any adjustments to the Initial Price, the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Fixed Conversion Rates that become effective during the period in which the Applicable Market Value, the Early Conversion Value, the Average Price or the Make-whole Market Value, as the case may be, is being calculated.
(l) Because (A) the period in which the Applicable Market Value is calculated ends on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Mandatory Conversion Date, (B) the period in which the Early Conversion Market Value is calculated ends on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Optional Conversion Date and (C) the period in which the Average Price is calculated ends on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the payment date for the relevant dividend, the Corporation shall deem Holders to be holders of record of Common Stock on the applicable Adjustment Date, solely to the extent that such holders shall receive shares of Common Stock upon Mandatory Conversion, Optional Conversion or the payment of a dividend, as applicable, and solely to the extent necessary to account for any adjustments to the Initial Price, the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Fixed Conversion Rates that become effective (each such effective date, an ""):

as applicable.
In each such case, the Holders shall receive the dividend or distribution on Common Stock, or additional shares issued upon a stock split, together with any shares of Common Stock that such Holders would otherwise receive upon Mandatory Conversion, Optional Conversion, or the payment of the relevant dividend; , , that the number of shares received would be decreased upon an Adjustment Date associated with a share combination as described in Section 11(a) or any readjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Section 11.
provided
however
 
If the Corporation shall be required to withhold on constructive distributions to a Holder and the Corporation pays the applicable withholding taxes, the Corporation may, at its option, set off any such payment against payments of cash or shares of Common Stock payable to such Holder.
(m) Whenever Fixed Conversion Rates are adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation shall promptly file with the Conversion Agent an Officer's certificate setting forth each Fixed Conversion Rate after such adjustment and a brief statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate was determined. Unless and until a responsible officer of the Conversion Agent shall have received such Officer's certificate, the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Fixed Conversion Rates and may assume that the last Fixed Conversion Rates of which it has knowledge are still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Corporation shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of Fixed Conversion Rates setting forth the adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall promptly mail such notice of adjustment of Fixed Conversion Rates to each Holder at its last address appearing in the stock register. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(n) For purposes of this Section 11, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation, unless such treasury shares participate in any distribution or dividend that requires an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
12. . No Holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock upon conversion to the extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would cause such converting Holder to become, directly or indirectly, a "beneficial owner" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of more than 4.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. Any purported delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Preferred Stock shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in the converting Holder becoming the beneficial owner of more than 4.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. If any delivery of shares of Common Stock owed to a Holder upon conversion of Preferred Stock is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this Section 8, the obligation of the Corporation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and the Corporation shall deliver such shares of Common Stock as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than two Trading Days after, any such converting Holder gives notice to the Corporation that such delivery would not result in such converting Holder being the beneficial owner of more than 4.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time.
