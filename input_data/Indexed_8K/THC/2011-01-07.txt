On January 7, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "") of Tenet Healthcare Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the ""), declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a "") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $.05, of the Company. The dividend is payable on January 17, 2011 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2011.
Board
Company
Right
The following is a summary description of the Rights. This summary is intended to provide a general description only and is subject to the detailed terms and conditions of the Section 382 Rights Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2011, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Rights Agent (the ""), a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1, which is incorporated herein by reference. All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Rights Agreement.
Rights Agreement
Our Board adopted the Rights Agreement in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that our ability to use our net operating losses (collectively, the "") to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited. We have substantial NOLs. Under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, we may "carry forward" these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the NOLs do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will be able to carry forward a significant amount of NOLs, and therefore these NOLs could be a substantial asset to us. However, if we experience an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use the NOLs may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the NOLs could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset. A company experiences an "ownership change" for tax purposes if the percentage of stock owned by its 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
NOLs
The Rights Agreement is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of our Board. Stockholders who beneficially own 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock as of the close of business on January 7, 2011 will not trigger the Rights Agreement so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock representing one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of our common stock at a time when they still beneficially own 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock. Our Board may, in its sole discretion, also exempt any person from triggering the Rights Agreement.
. Our Board authorized the issuance of one Right per each outstanding share of our common stock payable to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2011. One Right will also be issued together with each share of our common stock issued after January 17, 2011 but before the Distribution Date (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, after the Distribution Date. Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Agreement, if the Rights become exercisable, each Right would initially represent the right to purchase from us one ten-thousandth of a share of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.15 per share (the "") for a purchase price of $20.00 (the ""). If issued, each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one share of our common stock. However, prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.
The Rights

Purchase Price
 
. The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) ten business days after a public announcement that a person has become an "Acquiring Person" by acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock (or, in the case of a person that had beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock as of the close of business on January 7, 2011, by obtaining beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock representing one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of our common stock) and (ii) ten business days (or such later date as may be specified by the Board prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by or on behalf of a person that, if completed, would result in such person becoming an Acquiring Person.
Initial Exercisability
We refer to the date that the Rights become exercisable as the "." Until the Distribution Date, our common stock certificates or the ownership statements issued with respect to uncertificated shares of common stock will evidence the Rights. Any transfer of shares of common stock prior to the Distribution Date will also constitute a transfer of the associated Rights. After the Distribution Date, separate rights certificates will be issued and the Rights may be transferred other than in connection with the transfer of the underlying shares of common stock unless and until our Board has determined to effect an exchange pursuant to the Rights Agreement (as described below).
Distribution Date
. In the event that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or, under certain circumstances, were beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become null and void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, a number of shares of our common stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
Flip-In Event
At any time until a person becomes an "Acquiring Person", the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.00001 per Right (the ""). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
Redemption.
Redemption Price
. At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board may exchange the Rights (other than Rights that have become null and void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock, or a fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment). Immediately upon an exchange of any Rights, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the number of shares of common stock (or fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the exchange ratio. The Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after an Acquiring Person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Exchange
 
. The Rights and the Rights Agreement will expire on the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on the Final Expiration Date, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed pursuant to the Rights Agreement, (iii) the time at which the Rights are exchanged in full pursuant to the Rights Agreement, (iv) the effective date of the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision or replacement provision, if the Board determines that the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of Tax Benefits or (v) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company for which the Board determines that the Company has or will have no Tax Benefits.
Expiration
. Our Board may adjust the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or other securities or assets issuable and the number of outstanding Rights to prevent dilution that may occur as a result of certain events, including among others, a stock dividend, a stock split or a reclassification of the Series A Preferred Stock or our common stock. With certain exceptions, no adjustments to the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the Purchase Price.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
. For so long as the Rights are redeemable, our Board may supplement or amend any provision of the Rights Agreement in any respect without the approval of the holders of the Rights. From and after the time the Rights are no longer redeemable, our Board may supplement or amend the Rights Agreement only to cure an ambiguity, to alter time period provisions, to correct inconsistent provisions, or to make any additional changes to the Rights Agreement which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, but only to the extent that those changes do not impair or adversely affect any Rights holder (other than an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or certain of their transferees) and do not result in the Rights again becoming redeemable or the Rights Agreement again becoming amendable other than in accordance with this sentence.

Dividends and Distributions
(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock, par value $.05 per share, of the Corporation (the ""), and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September, and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a ""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
Rights Dividend Declaration Date
 
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "") that shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two directors.
default period
(ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, that such voting right shall not be exercised unless the holders of 10% in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two directors. If the number that may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the Board of Directors. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to such holder at such holder's last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
(iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, shall have exercised their right to elect two directors, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock that elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (C) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors.
 
(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:

(ii) declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or
provided
(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under Paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
Section 5. . Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Articles of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or as otherwise required by law.

Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up
(A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to $10,000 per share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the ""). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 10,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends, and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the ""). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to one with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

Adjustment Number
(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences.
(C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 7. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination, or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for, converted or changed into other stock or securities, cash, or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged, converted or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash, or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed, converted or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange, conversion or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Amendment
Section 11. .

In the event any Indemnitee was, is, or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in a Proceeding by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Corporation shall indemnify such Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law as soon as practicable but in any event no later than 30 days after written demand to the Corporation in accordance with Section 10.4, from and against any and all Expenses, liability or loss, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, any interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Article X, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto).
10.2.2. Initiation of Proceeding by Indemnitee.
Notwithstanding anything in this Article X to the contrary, no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or payment of Expenses pursuant to this Article X in connection with any Proceeding or part thereof initiated by such Indemnitee (including, without limitation, counterclaims) against the Corporation or any of its Affiliates or subsidiaries, or any director or officer of the Corporation or any of its Affiliates or subsidiaries, unless (a) the Corporation or the applicable Affiliate or subsidiary has joined in or the Board has consented to the initiation of such Proceeding; (b) the Proceeding is one to enforce indemnification rights under Section 10.5, or (c) the Proceeding is instituted after a Change in Control.
 
10.2.3. Payment of Expenses in Advance of Final Disposition.
If so requested by any Indemnitee, the Corporation shall pay any and all Expenses to such Indemnitee (an "Expense Payment") within 15 business days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from such Indemnitee requesting such payment or payments. Expense Payments shall be made without regard to any Indemnitee's ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to any Indemnitee's ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the provisions of this Article X. An Indemnitee shall qualify for the payment of Expenses solely upon the execution and delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation providing that such Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Payments shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of payment. Any determination made by the Independent Counsel that an Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and such Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Corporation for any Expense Payment until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed). An Indemnitee's obligation to reimburse the Corporation for Expense Payments shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.
10.2.4. Mandatory Indemnification.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful (on the merits or otherwise) in defense of any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith. For purposes of this Section 10.2.4 and without limiting the foregoing, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in any such Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.
10.2.5. Partial Indemnification.
If any Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article X to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of any Expenses, liability or loss, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, any interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, or any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Article X, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify such Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which such Indemnitee is entitled.
 
Section 10.3 Authorization of Indemnification; Independent Counsel.
The person, persons or entity (the "Independent Counsel") who shall determine whether indemnification is permissible under applicable law shall be an attorney admitted to practice in the State of Nevada, selected by the Indemnitee seeking indemnification and approved and appointed by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of the Disinterested Directors. If no Disinterested Directors exist, then the Board shall select a person, persons or entity otherwise capable of acting as Independent Counsel to appoint the Independent Counsel. The Independent Counsel shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the applicable Indemnitee against the other in an action to determine such Indemnitee's rights under this Article X or under any agreement between such Indemnitee and the Corporation. Such counsel, among other things, shall render a written determination to the Corporation and such Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent such Indemnitee is permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. The Corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel and any party selected to appoint Independent Counsel and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arising out of or relating to this Article X or their engagement hereunder.
Section 10.4 Indemnification Process and Appeal.
10.4.1. An Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification and shall receive payment thereof from the Corporation in accordance with this Article X as soon as practicable but in any event no later than 30 calendar days after such Indemnitee has made written demand on the Corporation for indemnification (which written demand shall include such documentation and information as is reasonably available to such Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification), unless the Independent Counsel has provided a written determination to the Corporation and such Indemnitee that indemnification is not permissible under applicable law.
10.4.2. If (a) no determination as to whether indemnification is permissible under applicable law has been made within 30 calendar days after an Indemnitee has made a demand in accordance with Section 10.4.1, (b) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 10.4.1 is not made within 30 calendar days after a determination that indemnification is permissible under applicable law, (c) Independent Counsel determines pursuant to Section 10.4.1 that indemnification is not permissible under applicable law, or (d) an Indemnitee has not received payment of Expenses within 15 business days after making such a request in accordance with Section 10.2.3, then the applicable Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce its rights under this Article X by commencing litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any determination by the Independent Counsel or any aspect thereof. Any determination by the Independent Counsel not challenged by the applicable Indemnitee on or before the first anniversary of the date of the Independent Counsel's determination shall be binding on the Corporation and such Indemnitee. The remedy provided for in this Section 10.4 is non-exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies available to each Indemnitee in law or equity.
10.4.3. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in making a determination with respect to whether indemnification is permissible, the Independent Counsel shall presume that indemnification is permissible if the applicable Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10.4.1, and the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by the Independent Counsel of any determination contrary to that presumption.
 
10.4.4. It shall be a defense to any action brought by any Indemnitee against the Corporation to enforce this Article X (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Expense Payment incurred in connection with a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that it is not permissible under applicable law for the Corporation to indemnify such Indemnitee for the amount claimed.
10.4.5. In connection with any action brought pursuant to Section 10.4.2 as to whether an Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the Corporation must prove with clear and convincing evidence that such Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Article X. Neither the failure of the Independent Counsel to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action by such Indemnitee that indemnification is permissible under applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Independent Counsel that indemnification is not permissible under applicable law shall be admissible as evidence in any such action for any purpose. For purposes of this Article X, the termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that such Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.
10.4.6. For the purposes of any determination by the Independent Counsel under this Article X, an Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful, if such Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such Indemnitee by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 10.4.6 shall mean any of the Corporation's Affiliates or subsidiaries or any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which the applicable Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 10.4.6 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which any Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth under Nevada law.
Section 10.5 Indemnification for Expenses Incurred in Enforcing Rights.
The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by an Indemnitee, shall pay such Expenses to such Indemnitee in advance of final disposition on such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate, that are incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or action brought by such Indemnitee for (a) enforcement of this Article X, (b) indemnification of Expenses or Expense Payments by the Corporation under any agreement or under applicable law or under any provision of these Bylaws or the Articles now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, and/or (c) recovery under directors' or officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Corporation.
 
Section 10.6 Notification and Defense of Proceeding.
10.6.1. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding relating to an Indemnifiable Event, such Indemnitee shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Corporation under this Article X, notify the Corporation of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to such Indemnitee.
10.6.2. With respect to any Proceeding relating to an Indemnifiable Event as to which an Indemnitee notifies the Corporation of the commencement thereof, the Corporation shall be entitled to participate in such Proceeding at its own expense and except as otherwise provided below, and, to the extent the Corporation so wishes, it may assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the applicable Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of any Proceeding relating to an Indemnifiable Event, the Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnitee under this Article X or otherwise for any Expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. The applicable Indemnitee shall have the right to employ such Indemnitee's own counsel in such Proceeding but all Expenses related thereto incurred after notice from the Corporation of its election to assume the defense shall be at such Indemnitee's expense unless: (a) the employment of counsel by such Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (b) such Indemnitee has reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnitee and the Corporation in the defense of the Proceeding, (c) Independent Counsel has determined that a Change in Control has occurred, or (d) the Corporation shall not within 30 calendar days in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, in each of which case all Expenses of the Proceeding shall be borne by the Corporation. If the Corporation has selected counsel to represent the applicable Indemnitee and other current and former directors and officers of the Corporation and its Affiliates and subsidiaries in the defense of a Proceeding, and a majority of such persons, including such Indemnitee, reasonably object to such counsel selected by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 10.6.2, then such persons, including such Indemnitee, shall be permitted to employ one additional counsel of their choice and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Corporation; , , that such counsel shall be chosen from amongst the list of counsel, if any, approved by any company with which the Corporation obtains or maintains insurance. In the event separate counsel is retained by an Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 10.6.2, the Corporation shall cooperate with such Indemnitee with respect to the defense of the Proceeding, including making documents, witnesses and other reasonable information related to the defense available to such Indemnitee and such separate counsel pursuant to joint-defense agreements or confidentiality agreements, as appropriate. The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Corporation or as to which the determination shall have been made by the applicable Indemnitee pursuant to clause (b) above or by Independent Counsel pursuant to clause (c) above.
provided
however
 
10.6.3. The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnitee under this Article X or otherwise for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Corporation's written consent, provided, , that if a Change in Control has occurred, the Corporation shall be liable for indemnification of an Indemnitee for amounts paid in settlement if the Independent Counsel has approved the settlement. The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on any Indemnitee without such Indemnitee's written consent. Neither the Corporation nor any Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement. The Corporation's liability hereunder shall not be excused if participation in the Proceeding by the Corporation was barred by this Article X.
however
Section 10.7 Non-Exclusivity.
The rights of each Indemnitee hereunder are non-exclusive and shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnitee may have under applicable law, the Articles, under any agreement or otherwise. To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Articles, these Bylaws or applicable law, it is the intent of the parties that each Indemnitee enjoy by this Article X the greater benefits so afforded by such change.
Section 10.8 Liability Insurance.
The Corporation has the power to purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any Indemnitee for any liability asserted against him or her and liability and Expenses incurred by him or her in his or her capacity, whether or not the Corporation has the authority to indemnify the Indemnitee against such liability and expenses. The other financial arrangements described in the preceding sentence made by the Corporation may include the creation of a trust fund, the establishment of a program of self insurance, securing the Corporation's obligation of indemnification by granting a security interest or other lien on any assets of the Corporation or the establishment of a letter of credit, guaranty or surety. No financial arrangement made pursuant to this Article X may provide protection for a person adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable for intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law, except with respect to the advancement of expenses or indemnification ordered by a court. The fact that the Corporation purchases such insurance or maintains such other financial arrangements shall not limit the scope of indemnity granted to an Indemnitee by this Article X. In the absence of fraud, the decision by the Board as to the propriety of the terms and conditions of any insurance or other financial arrangement made pursuant to this Section 10.8 and the choice of the person to provide the insurance or other financial arrangement is conclusive and the insurance or other financial arrangement is not void or voidable and does not subject any director approving it to personal liability for his or her action, even if the director approving the insurance or other financial arrangement is a beneficiary of the insurance or other financial arrangement.
Section 10.9 Subrogation.
In the event of payment under this Article X, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the applicable Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
 
Section 10.10 No Duplication of Payments.
The Corporation shall not be liable under this Article X to make any payment in connection with any claim made against any Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, agreement or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
Section 10.11 Contractual Rights.
The right of each Indemnitee to be indemnified or to the advancement or reimbursement of Expenses (a) is a contract right based upon good and valuable consideration, pursuant to which such Indemnitee may sue as if these provisions were set forth in a separate written contract between him or her and the Corporation, and (b) shall continue after any rescission or restrictive modification of such provisions as to events occurring prior thereto. Neither the amendment or repeal of, nor the adoption of a provision inconsistent with, any provision of this Article X (including, without limitation, this Section 10.11), nor the adoption of any provision of the Articles, nor to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law, any modification of law, shall adversely affect the rights of any person who is or was an Indemnitee under this Article X with respect to any Proceeding arising out of any action or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision, without the written consent of such person.
Section 10.12 Indemnification Agreements.
In addition to the provisions of this Article X, the Corporation may enter into agreements with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its Affiliates or subsidiaries providing for indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law.
Section 10.13 Applicability to Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as Amended.
The rights provided by this Article X shall be applicable to any present or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation appointed from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation or his designee to serve in the administration and management of any separate, segregated fund established for purposes of collecting and distributing voluntary employee political contributions to federal election campaigns pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, provided that any such present or former director, officer, employee or agent has served as such capacity on or after the Effective Date, and any such present or former director, officer, employee or agent shall be deemed to be an Indemnitee under this Article X.
 
Section 10.14 Severability.
If any provision (or portion thereof) of this Article X shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Furthermore, to the fullest extent possible, the remaining provisions of this Article X shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, void, or unenforceable.
Section 10.15 Subsidiaries.
On vote of the Board, the Corporation may assent to the adoption of this Article X by any subsidiary, whether or not wholly owned.
The corporate seal shall be circular in form and shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation, the date of its incorporation and the word "Nevada".
Reference in these Bylaws to any provision of Nevada law or the Nevada Revised Statutes shall be deemed to include all amendments thereto and the effect of the construction and determination of validity thereof by the Nevada Supreme Court.

If neither the Common Stock nor the Preferred Stock are publicly held or so listed or traded, or the subject of available bid and asked quotes, "" of the Preferred Stock shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.

(i) The Company may elect, on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price, to adjust the number of Rights in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. The Company shall also, as promptly as practicable, notify the Rights Agent in writing of same pursuant to Section 9(e) hereof and give the Rights Agent a copy of such announcement. Such record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but if the Rights Certificates have been issued, such record date shall be at least ten calendar days later than the date of the public announcement. If Rights Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Rights Certificates on such record date Rights Certificates evidencing, subject to the provision of Section 13 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders are entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Rights Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof if required by the Company, new Rights Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders are entitled after such adjustment. Rights Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed, and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Rights Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
(j) Without respect to any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number or kind of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Rights Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number and kind of securities which were expressed in the initial Rights Certificate issued hereunder.
(k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below one ten-thousandth of the then par value, if any, of the shares of Preferred Stock or below the then par value, if any, of any other securities of the Company issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Preferred Stock or such other securities, as the case may be, at such adjusted Purchase Price.
 
(l) In any case in which this Section 11 otherwise requires that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent) until the occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock or other securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock or other securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , , that the Company delivers to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares of Preferred Stock or other securities upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

For purposes of this Section 13(a), the current market value of one Right is the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any Trading Day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported on a quotation system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights, such market maker to be selected by the Board.

Fractions of Preferred Stock in integral multiples of one ten-thousandth of such Preferred Stock may, in the sole discretion of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it, provided that such agreement provides that the holders of such depositary receipts have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as Beneficial Owners of the Preferred Stock represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional shares of Preferred Stock that are not integral multiples of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, the Company may pay to the registered holders of Rights Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock. For purposes of this Section 13(b), the current market value of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock shall be one ten-thousandth of the closing price of a share of Preferred Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise; , , that if the closing price of the shares of the Preferred Stock cannot be so determined, the closing price of the shares of the Preferred Stock for such Trading Day shall be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to the closing price of the shares of Common Stock for such Trading Day multiplied by ten thousand (as such number may be appropriately adjusted to reflect events such as stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar transactions relating to the Common Stock shares occurring after the date of this Agreement).

(b) If at any time the name of the Rights Agent changes and at such time any of the Rights Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Rights Certificates so countersigned; and if at that time any of the Rights Certificates have not been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.
The Rights Agent undertakes to perform the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties) upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Section 19 Duties of the Rights Agent.
(a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company and/or an employee of the Rights Agent), and the advice or opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the content of such advice or opinion.
 
(b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter (including, without limitation, the identity of any Acquiring Person and the determination of the Current Per Share Market Price) be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any Authorized Officer and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate, pursuant to its terms, shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
(c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (each as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).
(d) The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Rights Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) and it shall not be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e) The Rights Agent will have no liability in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or failure by the Company to satisfy any condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any adjustment required under the provisions of Section 11, Section 22 or Section 23 hereof or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Rights Certificates after receipt of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12 hereof, describing any such change or adjustment, upon which the Rights Agent may rely); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Rights Certificate or as to whether any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall, when so issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
(f) The Company agrees that it shall perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of its duties under this Agreement.
 
(g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties and the exercise of the rights hereunder from any Authorized Officer, and to apply to any such Authorized Officer for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with such instructions. The Rights Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying upon the most recent instructions received from any such Authorized Officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Rights Agent under this Agreement and the date on or after which such action shall be taken, suffered or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any Authorized Officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such Authorized Officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking or suffering any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken, suffered or omitted to be taken.
(h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, affiliate, director, officer, agent or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not the Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent or any stockholder, affiliate, director, officer, agent or employee from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other Person.
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself (through its directors, officers or employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, omission, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company or any other Person resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (each as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) in the selection and continued employment thereof.
(j) If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in the form of assignment or the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse thereof, as the case may be, has not been completed or indicates an affirmative response to clause 1 or 2 thereof, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company.
(k) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(l) The Rights Agent will not be required to take notice or be deemed to have notice of any fact, event or determination (including, without limitation, any dates or events defined in this Agreement or the designation of any Person as an Acquiring Person, Affiliate or Associate) under this Agreement unless and until the Rights Agent is specifically notified in writing by the Company of such fact, event or determination, and the Rights Agent shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability for failing to take any action in connection therewith unless and until it has received such written notice.
(m) The provisions of this Section 19 shall survive the exercise, exchange, redemption or expiration of the Rights, the resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent and the termination of this Agreement.
The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 calendar days' written notice given to the Company in accordance with Section 25 hereof, and to each transfer agent of the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock known to the Rights Agent, respectively, by registered or certified mail, and, if such resignation occurs after the Distribution Date, to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates in accordance with Section 25 hereof. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 calendar days' written notice, given to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 25 hereof, and to each transfer agent of the shares of Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, by registered or certified mail, and, if such removal occurs after the Distribution Date, to the holders of the Rights Certificates in accordance with Section 25 hereof. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 calendar days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Rights Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then any registered holder of any Rights Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (a) a legal business entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any state of the United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise shareholder services powers and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (b) an Affiliate of a legal business entity described in clause (a) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the shares of Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, and, if such appointment occurs after the Distribution Date, give a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates in accordance with Section 25 hereof. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 20, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Section 20 Change of the Rights Agent.
 
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by the Board to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Rights Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale by the Company of shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company (a) shall, with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, granted or awarded as of the Distribution Date, or upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of securities hereinafter issued by the Company and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board, issue Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; , , that (i) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, in its good faith judgment the Board determines that the issuance of such Rights Certificate could have a material adverse tax consequence to the Company or to the Person to whom or which such Rights Certificate otherwise would be issued, and (ii) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.

The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, securities or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board.
(b) Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board ordering the redemption of the Rights, and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price for each Right so held without interest thereon. Promptly after the effectiveness of the redemption of the Rights, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and the holders of the then outstanding Rights in accordance with Section 25 hereof; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice will not affect the validity of the redemption of the Rights. Any notice given in accordance with Section 25 hereof shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption shall state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price shall be made.

Section 23 Exchange.
(a) The Board may, at its option, at any time after a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, exchange all or part of the then-outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such amount per Right being hereinafter referred to as the ""). The exchange of the Rights by the Board may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish.

(b) Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board ordering the exchange of any Rights and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange (with prompt written notice thereof to the Rights Agent); , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company shall promptly give a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of the Rights so exchanged in accordance with Section 25 hereof. Any notice given in accordance with Section 25 hereof shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock, for Rights shall be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.

(c) The Company may at its option substitute and, in the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued (and unreserved) to permit an exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 23, the Company shall substitute to the extent of such insufficiency, for each share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number of shares of Preferred Stock or fraction thereof (or Equivalent Preferred Stock) such that the Current Per Share Market Price of one share of Preferred Stock (or Equivalent Preferred Stock) multiplied by such number or fraction is equal to the Current Per Share Market Price of the Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable as of the date of such exchange.
(d) Prior to effecting an exchange pursuant to this Section 23, the Board may direct the Company to enter into a trust agreement in such form and with such terms as the Board shall then approve (the ""). If the Board so directs, the Company shall enter into the Trust Agreement and shall issue to the trust created by such agreement (the "") all of the shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other securities, if any, issuable pursuant to the exchange, and all Persons entitled to receive such shares or other securities (and any dividends or distributions made thereon after the date on which such shares or other securities are deposited in the Trust) shall be entitled to receive such only from the Trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.

Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "") that shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two directors.
default period
(ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, that such voting right shall not be exercised unless the holders of 10% in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two directors. If the number that may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
provided
pari passu
 
(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the Board of Directors. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to such holder at such holder's last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
(iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, shall have exercised their right to elect two directors, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock that elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (C) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors.
(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
 
Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
(i) declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
(ii) declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or
provided
(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under Paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
Section 5. . Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Articles of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or as otherwise required by law.

Section 6. .
Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up
(A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to $10,000 per share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the ""). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 10,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends, and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the ""). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to one with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences.
(C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 7. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination, or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for, converted or changed into other stock or securities, cash, or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged, converted or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash, or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed, converted or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Dividend Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange, conversion or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Amendment
Section 11. .

Exhibit C
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS SET FORTH IN THE SECTION 382 RIGHTS AGREEMENT, RIGHTS THAT ARE OR WERE BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY AN ACQUIRING PERSON OR ANY AFFILIATE OR ASSOCIATE OF AN ACQUIRING PERSON (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE SECTION 382 RIGHTS AGREEMENT) MAY BECOME NULL AND VOID.
On January 7, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "") of Tenet Healthcare Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the ""), declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a "") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $.05, of the Company. The dividend is payable on January 17, 2011 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2011.
Board
Company
Right
This summary of rights provides only a general description and should be read together with the Section 382 Rights Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2011, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Rights Agent (the ""). All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Rights Agreement. Upon written request, the Company will provide a copy of the Rights Agreement free of charge to any of its stockholders.
Rights Agreement
Our Board adopted the Rights Agreement in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that our ability to use our net operating losses (collectively, the "") to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited. We have substantial NOLs. Under the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, we may "carry forward" these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the NOLs do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will be able to carry forward a significant amount of NOLs, and therefore these NOLs could be a substantial asset to us. However, if we experience an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use the NOLs may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the NOLs could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset. A company experiences an "ownership change" for tax purposes if the percentage of stock owned by its 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
NOLs
The Rights Agreement is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of our Board. Stockholders who beneficially own 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock as of the close of business on January 7, 2011 will not trigger the Rights Agreement so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock representing one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of our common stock at a time when they still beneficially own 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock. Our Board may, in its sole discretion, also exempt any person from triggering the Rights Agreement.
 
. Our Board authorized the issuance of one Right per each outstanding share of our common stock payable to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2011. One Right will also be issued together with each share of our common stock issued after January 17, 2011 but before the Distribution Date (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, after the Distribution Date. Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Agreement, if the Rights become exercisable, each Right would initially represent the right to purchase from us one ten-thousandth of a share of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.15 per share (the "") for a purchase price of $20.00 (the ""). If issued, each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one share of our common stock. However, prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.
The Rights
Series A Preferred Stock
Purchase Price
. The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) ten business days after a public announcement that a person has become an "Acquiring Person" by acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock (or, in the case of a person that had beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock as of the close of business on January 7, 2011, by obtaining beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock representing one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of our common stock) and (ii) ten business days (or such later date as may be specified by the Board prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by or on behalf of a person that, if completed, would result in such person becoming an Acquiring Person.
Initial Exercisability
We refer to the date that the Rights become exercisable as the "." Until the Distribution Date, our common stock certificates or the ownership statements issued with respect to uncertificated shares of common stock will evidence the Rights. Any transfer of shares of common stock prior to the Distribution Date will also constitute a transfer of the associated Rights. After the Distribution Date, separate rights certificates will be issued and the Rights may be transferred other than in connection with the transfer of the underlying shares of common stock unless and until our Board has determined to effect an exchange pursuant to the Rights Agreement (as described below).
Distribution Date
. In the event that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or, under certain circumstances, were beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become null and void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, a number of shares of our common stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
Flip-In Event
At any time until a person becomes an "Acquiring Person", the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.00001 per Right (the ""). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
Redemption.
Redemption Price
 
. At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board may exchange the Rights (other than Rights that have become null and void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock, or a fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment). Immediately upon an exchange of any Rights, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the number of shares of common stock (or fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the exchange ratio. The Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after an Acquiring Person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Exchange
. The Rights and the Rights Agreement will expire on the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on the Final Expiration Date, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed pursuant to the Rights Agreement, (iii) the time at which the Rights are exchanged in full pursuant to the Rights Agreement, (iv) the effective date of the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provision or replacement provision, if the Board determines that the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of Tax Benefits or (v) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company for which the Board determines that the Company has or will have no Tax Benefits.
Expiration
. Our Board may adjust the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or other securities or assets issuable and the number of outstanding Rights to prevent dilution that may occur as a result of certain events, including among others, a stock dividend, a stock split or a reclassification of the Series A Preferred Stock or our common stock. With certain exceptions, no adjustments to the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the Purchase Price.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
. For so long as the Rights are redeemable, our Board may supplement or amend any provision of the Rights Agreement in any respect without the approval of the holders of the Rights. From and after the time the Rights are no longer redeemable, our Board may supplement or amend the Rights Agreement only to cure an ambiguity, to alter time period provisions, to correct inconsistent provisions, or to make any additional changes to the Rights Agreement which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, but only to the extent that those changes do not impair or adversely affect any Rights holder (other than an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or certain of their transferees) and do not result in the Rights again becoming redeemable or the Rights Agreement again becoming amendable other than in accordance with this sentence.
Amendments
The Company has filed a copy of the Rights Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a Form 8-A filed on January 7, 2011. In addition, a copy of the Rights Agreement is available free of charge from the Company. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) today announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan in the form of a Section 382 Rights Agreement (the "Section 382 Rights Agreement") designed to protect the Company's ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), which total approximately $2 billion.
DALLAS  January 7, 2011
United States federal income tax rules, and Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in particular, could substantially limit the use of net operating losses and other tax assets if Tenet experiences an "ownership change" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code). In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of Tenet by "5 percent stockholders" that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
The Company noted the Section 382 Rights Agreement serves the interests of all stockholders by protecting the Company's ability to use its deferred tax assets to offset tax liabilities in the future.
Under the terms of the Section 382 Rights Agreement, the Company will distribute to its stockholders a non-taxable dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each share of common stock of the Company outstanding as of the close of business on January 17, 2011. The Section 382 Rights Agreement is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock (an "Acquiring Person"). Stockholders who beneficially owned 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock as of the close of business on January 7, 2011 will not become an Acquiring Person so long as they do not acquire additional shares of common stock representing one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the Company's common stock then outstanding while they still beneficially own 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.
A person who becomes an Acquiring Person may be subject to significant dilution in their holdings. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, exempt any person from being deemed an Acquiring Person for purposes of the Section 382 Rights Agreement.
Tenet will file the Section 382 Rights Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The above description is only a summary; interested persons are urged to read the full Section 382 Rights Agreement as so filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, Tenet today announced that its Board of Directors has amended the Company's bylaws to allow for the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Thursday, November 3, 2011. Tenet will announce the record date, time and location of the 2011 annual meeting in due course.
Barclays Capital is acting as financial advisor to Tenet and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP are acting as Tenet's legal counsel.
