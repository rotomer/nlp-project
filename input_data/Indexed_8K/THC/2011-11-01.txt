Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) today reported adjusted EBITDA of $195 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011 compared to $203 million for the third quarter of 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, was $8 million in the third quarter of 2011 ($0.02 per diluted share), or $16 million ($0.04 per diluted share) after excluding impairment and restructuring charges and litigation costs of $13 million pre-tax, $8 million after-tax. Income from continuing operations, net of tax in the third quarter of 2010 included the recognition of $981 million of tax benefits associated with the Company's net operating loss carryforward, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $55 million pre-tax, $35 million after-tax. Except for these two items, the third quarter of 2010 would have been a loss of $14 million, or a loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Reported Income from continuing operations, net of tax, which includes these two items in the third quarter of 2010 was $932 million, or $1.68 per diluted share.

"Volume growth was very strong in our third quarter," said Trevor Fetter, president and chief executive officer. "Adjusted admissions growth of 2.3 percent and surgery growth of 3.2 percent drove a 3.5 percent increase in net operating revenues. This top line growth was further leveraged by excellent cost control and attractive pricing increases in our new contracts with commercial managed care payers. Given this progress across our key performance metrics, we are pleased to reconfirm our 2011 EBITDA Outlook in a range of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion."
Discussion of Results
(Percentage changes compare Q3'11 to Q3'10, unless otherwise noted.)
Adjusted EBITDA declined by 3.9 percent in the third quarter of 2011, which included adverse impacts from a less attractive payer mix, lower state Medicaid payment rates, $16 million of expense related to lower discount rates, and higher Healthcare Information Technology ("HIT") expense. In recent quarters EBITDA has benefitted from certain favorable items including state provider fees and government HIT incentive payments which were largely absent in the third quarter. These revenue sources are expected to resume in the fourth quarter which, in conjunction with seasonal volume strength, is expected to restore EBITDA growth.
Admissions and paying admissions increased by 1.5 and 1.6 percent, respectively. Outpatient visits and paying outpatient visits both increased by 3.4 percent. Adjusted admissions increased by 2.3 percent.
Net operating revenues were $2.342 billion, an increase of $80 million, or 3.5 percent, compared to net operating revenues of $2.262 billion in the third quarter of 2010. Net patient revenue per adjusted patient day was $2,406, an increase of $36, or 1.5 percent, as compared to $2,370 in the third quarter of 2010. This pricing increase was primarily the result of improved pricing in our commercial managed care contracts.
Controllable operating expenses per adjusted patient day were $2,112, an increase of $62, or 3.0 percent, as compared to the third quarter of 2010. This increase primarily reflects annual salary increases for our broad employee population as well as our growing investments in our HIT program, which are intended to further enhance the quality and efficiency of our healthcare service capabilities. Controllable operating expense is defined as the sum of salaries, wages and benefits, supplies, and other operating expenses. The Company accelerated the implementation of certain cost efficiency measures during the third quarter, producing a favorable impact of approximately $5 million in the quarter. These actions are expected to produce an incremental benefit of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter.
Bad debt expense was $193 million, an increase of $6 million, or 3.2 percent, as compared to the third quarter of 2010. The increase in bad debt expense is primarily related to a $9 million favorable adjustment in the third quarter of 2010 for Medicare bad debts included in our cost reports compared to a smaller favorable $2 million adjustment in the third quarter of 2011. Bad debt expense as a percent of net operating revenues declined to 8.2 percent, a decrease of 10 basis points from 8.3 percent in the third quarter of 2010.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $148 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $128 million in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of $20 million. Capital expenditures were $100 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $120 million in the third quarter of 2010. Cash and cash equivalents were $185 million at September 30, 2011, a decrease of $79 million from $264 million at June 30, 2011. Cash use in the third quarter of 2011 includes the use of $124 million to repurchase 24.0 million shares of the Company's common stock and $14 million for the purchase of an outpatient center and certain assets related to acquired physician practices. Through October 31, the Company repurchased an aggregate total of 59.7 million shares of common stock since announcing its $400 million share repurchase program in May 2011. These 59.7 million repurchased shares represent 12 percent of outstanding common shares, repurchased at an average price of $5.03 per share, and resulting in a total expenditure of approximately $300 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2011, there were 468.8 million weighted average basic shares outstanding and 483.6 million weighted average outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders before (1) cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax, (2) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, (3) preferred stock dividends, (4) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, (5) income tax (expense) benefit, (6) investment earnings (loss), (7) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, (8) net gain (loss) on sales of investments, (9) interest expense, (10) litigation and investigation (costs) benefit, net of insurance recoveries, (11) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs, (12) impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries, and (13) depreciation and amortization. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies.
The Company provides this information as a supplement to GAAP information to assist itself and investors in understanding the impact of various items on its financial statements, some of which are recurring or involve cash payments. The Company uses this information in its analysis of the performance of its business excluding items that it does not consider as relevant in the performance of its hospitals in continuing operations. In addition, from time to time we use this measure to define certain performance targets under our compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity, but is a measure of operating performance that management uses in its business as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes many items that are included in our financial statements, it does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's financial performance.
The reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders, the most comparable GAAP term, to Adjusted EBITDA, is set forth in the first table below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
