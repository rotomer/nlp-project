On April 30, 2012, Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet") sold $141,233,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes") in a private placement.  The 2018 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities laws. Tenet will pay interest on the 2018 Notes semi-annually, in arrears, on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2012, to holders of record on the immediately preceding April 15 and October 15. The 2018 Notes will rank pari passu with Tenet's previously issued 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2018, which were issued in November 2011, 9.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2015, which were issued in March 2009, 10% Senior Secured Notes due 2018, which were issued in March 2009, and 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2019, which were issued in June 2009, and similarly will be guaranteed by and secured by a pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of Tenet's subsidiaries.
 
The 2018 Notes were issued as "additional notes" pursuant to an indenture dated November 6, 2001, as supplemented by a fourteenth supplemental indenture thereto (the "Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture"), dated November 21, 2011, among Tenet, certain of its subsidiaries and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). Until the 2018 Notes become freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the 2018 Notes will have different CUSIP and ISIN numbers than the 2018 Notes issued on November 21, 2011. The Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Tenet's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries: (1) to incur liens; (2) consummate asset sales; (3) enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or (4) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets, other than in certain transactions between one or more of Tenet's wholly owned subsidiaries and Tenet. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In particular, there are no restrictions on Tenet's ability or the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, enter into transactions with affiliates or make advances to, or invest in, other entities (including unaffiliated entities).
 
The Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture also provides that the 2018 Notes may become subject to redemption under certain circumstances, including a change of control (as defined in the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture) of Tenet. In addition, Tenet may, at its option, redeem the 2018 Notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes being redeemed plus the applicable make-whole premium set forth in the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, Tenet also entered into an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement dated April 30, 2012 (the "2018 Notes Registration Rights Agreement"), with
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
, which sets forth Tenet's obligations to register the 2018 Notes under the Securities Act if the 2018 Notes have not become freely tradable (as defined in the agreement) on or before May 15, 2013.
 
On April 30, 2012, Tenet sold $150,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") in a private placement. The 2020 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act. Tenet will pay interest on the 2020 Notes semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2012, to holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15. The 2020 Notes are unsecured and will rank equally with all of Tenet's existing and future unsecured senior debt, will rank senior to all of Tenet's existing and future unsecured subordinated debt
 
and will be effectively subordinated to all of Tenet's existing and future secured debt, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness.
 
The 2020 Notes were issued as "additional notes" pursuant to an indenture dated November 6, 2001, as supplemented by a twelfth supplemental indenture thereto (the "Twelfth Supplemental Indenture"), dated August 17, 2010, between Tenet and the Trustee. The Twelfth Supplemental Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Tenet's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries: (1) to incur liens on principal properties and (2) to enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to principal properties. A principal property is defined in the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture as a hospital that has an asset value on our books in excess of 5% of our consolidated net tangible assets, as defined. These limitations do not apply, however, to (1) debt that is not secured by principal properties or (2) debt that is secured by principal properties if the aggregate of such secured debt does not exceed 15% of our consolidated net tangible assets, as further described in the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture. The Twelfth Supplemental Indenture also prohibits the consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all assets unless no event of default would result after giving effect to such transaction.
 
The Twelfth Supplemental Indenture also provides that the 2020 Notes may become subject to redemption under certain circumstances, including a change of control (as defined in the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture) of Tenet. In addition, Tenet may, at its option, redeem the 2020 Notes in whole or in part at any time on or before August 1, 2015 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes being redeemed plus the applicable make-whole premium set forth in the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, Tenet also entered into an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement dated April 30, 2012 (the "2020 Notes Registration Rights Agreement"), with
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
. Pursuant to the 2020 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, Tenet has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to register with the SEC notes having substantially identical terms as the 2020 Notes as part of an offer to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for these notes subject to the terms set forth in the 2020 Notes Registration Rights Agreement.
 
The proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes and the 2020 Notes were used, together with cash on hand, to acquire 298,700 shares of 7.000% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.15, issued by Tenet on September 25, 2009.
 
 
The discussions set forth in Items 1.01 and 2.03 are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(b)           ,  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) hereof.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(c).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(c), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The holders' obligations in this Section 6(c) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.
 
(d)           The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or any Guarantor (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or any Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and shall take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the safe harbor provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.  Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer.

Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with its initial sale of any Exchange Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Company shall permit the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus delivery requirement. To the extent necessary to ensure that the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is available for sales of Exchange Notes by Broker-Dealers, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to the provisions of Section 6(a) and (c) hereof and in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of 180 days from the Consummation Deadline or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto. The Company shall provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such Prospectus to such Broker-Dealers, promptly upon request, and in no event later than two Business Days after such request, at any time during such period.
 
SECTION 4. SHELF REGISTRATION
 
(a) . If (i) the Exchange Offer is not permitted by applicable law (after the Company has complied with the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) below) or the policies, rules or regulations of the Commission or (ii) for any reason the Exchange Offer is not Consummated by the Consummation Deadline or (iii) if any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall notify the Company within 20 Business Days following the Consummation of the Exchange Offer that (A) such Holder was prohibited by applicable law or the policies, rules or regulations of the Commission from participating in the Exchange Offer; or (B) such Holder may not resell the Exchange Notes acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to the public without delivering a prospectus and the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such resales by such Holder; or (C) such Holder is a Broker-Dealer and holds Additional Notes acquired directly from the Company or any of its Affiliates, then the Company shall:

Settlements
 
(e) . If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their sale of Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 8(e);  that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of indemnification.
provided, however,
 
The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(e).
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(e), no Holder, its directors, its officers or any person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Holder hereunder. For purposes of this Section 8(e), each director and officer of a Holder and each person, if any, who controls a Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each director and officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
SECTION 9. RULE 144A and RULE 144
 
The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
 
SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS
 
(a) . The Company will not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange Offer.
