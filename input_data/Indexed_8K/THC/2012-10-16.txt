Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On October 16, 2012, Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet") completed its offering of $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior secured notes due 2020 (the "Secured Notes") and $300,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the "Unsecured Notes" and, together with the Secured Notes, the "Notes").  The Notes were offered only to eligible purchasers through a private placement and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities laws.
 
Secured Notes
 
Tenet will pay interest on the Secured Notes semi-annually, in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2013, to holders of record on the immediately preceding May 15 and November 15. The Secured Notes will rank senior to Tenet's existing and future subordinated indebtedness, be effectively senior to Tenet's existing and future unsecured indebtedness and other liabilities to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the senior secured notes or guarantees thereon, and will rank pari passu with Tenet's 6.25% senior secured notes due 2018, which were issued in November 2011 and April 2012, 10% senior secured notes due 2018, which were issued in March 2009, and 8.875% senior secured notes due 2019, which were issued in June 2009, and similarly will be guaranteed by and secured by a pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of Tenet's subsidiaries, and will be subordinated to Tenet's obligations under its senior secured revolving credit facility, and any of its subsidiaries' secured guarantees thereof, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing borrowings under such facility.
 
The Secured Notes were issued pursuant to the Base Indenture, as supplemented by a fifteenth supplemental indenture (the "Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture") dated October 16, 2012, among Tenet, certain of its subsidiaries that will act as guarantors thereunder and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee to The Bank of New York (the "Trustee").  The Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Tenet's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries: to incur liens; provide subsidiary guarantees; consummate asset sales; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets, other than in certain transactions between one or more of Tenet's wholly owned subsidiaries and Tenet. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In particular, there are no restrictions on Tenet's ability or the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, enter into transactions with affiliates or make advances to, or invest in, other entities (including unaffiliated entities).
The Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture also provides that the Secured Notes may become subject to redemption under certain circumstances, including a change of control (as defined in the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture) of Tenet.  In addition, Tenet may, at its option, redeem the Secured Notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Secured Notes being redeemed plus the applicable make-whole premium set forth in the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In connection with the issuance of the Secured Notes, Tenet also entered into an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2012 (the "Secured Registration Rights Agreement"), with Barclays Capital Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the initial purchasers. Pursuant to the Secured Registration Rights Agreement, Tenet has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the Secured Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission if the Secured Notes have not become freely tradable (as defined in the agreement) on or before the 380th day following the date hereof.
 
The foregoing is a summary and is qualified by reference to the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture and Secured Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 10.1, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Unsecured Notes
 
Tenet will pay interest on the Unsecured Notes semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing February 1, 2013, to holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15. The Unsecured Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Tenet that will rank equally with Tenet's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, will rank senior to Tenet's existing and future subordinated indebtedness and will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness of Tenet to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness.
 
The Unsecured Notes were issued pursuant to the Base Indenture, as supplemented by a sixteenth supplemental indenture (the "Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture"), dated October 16, 2012, between Tenet and the Trustee.  The Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Tenet's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries: to incur liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets, other than in certain transactions between one or more of Tenet's wholly owned subsidiaries and Tenet. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. In particular, there are no restrictions on Tenet's ability or the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, enter into transactions with affiliates or make advances to, or invest in, other entities (including unaffiliated entities).
 
The Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture also provides that the Unsecured Notes may become subject to redemption under certain circumstances, including a change of control (as defined in the Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture) of Tenet.  In addition, Tenet may, at its option, redeem the Unsecured Notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Unsecured Notes being redeemed plus the applicable make-whole premium set forth in the Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In connection with the issuance of the Unsecured Notes, Tenet also entered into an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2012 (the "Unsecured Registration Rights Agreement"), with Barclays Capital Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. Pursuant to the Unsecured Registration Rights Agreement, Tenet has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement for the Unsecured Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 30 days after the date of the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2012.
 
The foregoing is a summary and is qualified by reference to the Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture and Unsecured Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.2 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, the Company and such Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with the preceding paragraph except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions subject to the preceding paragraph which is not applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph exceeds $100.0 million.  Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.6, such Net Available Cash may be used in any other manner not prohibited by the Indenture.
 
For purposes of this Section 4.6, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents:
 
(1)
          
the assumption or discharge of Debt or other liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Subsidiary from all liability on such Debt or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;
 
(2)
          
securities or other obligations received by the Company or any Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the Asset Disposition, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and
 
(3)
          
Additional Assets.
 
In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt), the Company will purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer by the Company for the Notes (and such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Special Interest, if any (or, in respect of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt, such other price, not to
exceed 100%, as may be provided for by the terms of such other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt), in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription)  set forth in Section 3.3 hereof.  If there remains a balance of Net Available Cash after purchasing all securities tendered, then such balance may be used in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.  If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company will select the securities to be purchased on a basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of $2,000 principal amount or any greater integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  The Company shall not be required to make such an Asset Disposition Offer to purchase Notes (and other First-Priority Stock Secured Debt) pursuant to this Section 4.6 if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than $100.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an Asset Disposition Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition).  Upon completion of such an Asset Disposition Offer, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such Asset Disposition Offer.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.6.

(1)           all First-Priority Stock Liens granted at any time by the Company or any other Pledgor secure, equally and ratably, all present and future First-Priority Stock Secured Obligations; and
 
(2)           all Proceeds of all First-Priority Stock Liens granted at any time by the Company or any other Pledgor will be allocated and distributed equally and ratably on account of the First-Priority Stock Secured Debt and other First-Priority Stock Secured Obligations.

(b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.5(a), the Company shall not be required to comply with all or any portion of TIA 314(d) if it determines, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of TIA 314(d) and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the Commission and its staff, including "no action" letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of TIA 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a series of released Collateral.

(b)           The Company and each of the Pledgors shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver such security documents, instruments, certificates, notices and other documents, and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to create, perfect, protect, assure or enforce the Liens and benefits intended to be conferred, in each case as contemplated by the Stock Secured Debt Documents for the benefit of the holders of Stock Secured Obligations.
 
Section 9.1.          
Guarantee
 
(a)           Subject to this Article Nine, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the Obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:
 
(1)           the principal of, premium and Special Interest, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at Maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other Obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and

Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.  Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
 
(b)           The Guarantors hereby agree that their Obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.  Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Note Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture.
 
(c)           If any Holder, the Trustee or the Collateral Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee, the Collateral Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full force and effect.
 
(d)           Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any Obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all Obligations guaranteed hereby.  Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the Maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five of the Existing Indenture (as amended hereby) for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article Five of the Existing Indenture (as amended hereby), such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee.  The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.

Limitation on Guarantor Liability
 
By its execution of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent
Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the Obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article Nine, result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantee

Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 9.1 hereof will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.
 
If an Officer whose signature is on this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture or on the Note Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Note Guarantee is endorsed, the Note Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantee set forth in this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.

Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee.  All the Note Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

Notices of Claims
,  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) hereof.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

(c)
                                 
Contribution.
 If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(c).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(c), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The holders' obligations in this Section 6(c) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.
 
(d)
                                
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantors may otherwise have
 
and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or any Guarantor (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or any Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and shall take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the safe harbor provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.  Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

The Company shall cause the Exchange Offer to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws. No securities other than the Exchange Notes shall be included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. The Company
provided, however,
 
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer to be Consummated on the earliest practicable date after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has become effective but in no event later than 30 Business Days thereafter, unless required by applicable law or the policies, rules or regulations of the Commission (the last day of such period being the "").

Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with its initial sale of any Exchange Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Company shall permit the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus delivery requirement. To the extent necessary to ensure that the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is available for sales of Exchange Notes by Broker-Dealers, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to the provisions of Section 6(a) and (c) hereof and in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of 180 days from the Consummation Deadline or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto.

regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) provided by the Company to any Holder or any prospective purchaser of Exchange Notes or registered Initial Notes, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in

provided, however,
 
(b) . Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Holder), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company and each such director, officer or controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen pursuant to Section 8(c)) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by the Company or such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. In no event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Indemnification of the Company
 
(c) In case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b) (the ""), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume and control the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except
indemnified party
indemnifying person
 
that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and 8(b), a Holder shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(c), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Holder). Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the Holders, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).
 
(d) . The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statements as to or any findings of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements
 
(e) . If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
Contribution
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their sale of Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
 
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 8(e);  that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of indemnification.
provided, however,
 
The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(e).
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(e), no Holder, its directors, its officers or any person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several, and not joint, in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Holder hereunder. For purposes of this Section 8(e), each director and officer of a Holder and each person, if any, who controls a Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each director and officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
SECTION 9. RULE 144A and RULE 144
 
The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject
 
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
 
SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS
 
(a) . The Company will not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
 
(b) .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange Offer.
Amendments and Waivers
 
(c) . The Holders shall be third party beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they may deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of Holders hereunder.
