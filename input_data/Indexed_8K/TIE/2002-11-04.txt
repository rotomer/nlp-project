EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: CONTACT: Titanium Metals Corporation Mark A. Wallace 1999 Broadway, Suite 4300 Executive Vice President Denver, Colorado 80202 and Chief Financial Officer (303) 296-5615 TIMET ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2002 RESULTS DENVER, COLORADO . . . October 24, 2002 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation ("TIMET" or the "Company") (NYSE: TIE) reported a net loss for the third quarter of 2002 of $9.1 million, or $.29 per share, compared to net income in the third quarter of 2001 of $4.3 million, or $.14 per share. Sales of $82.8 million in the third quarter of 2002 were 35% lower than the year-ago period. The decrease resulted principally from a 33% decrease in mill product sales volume, a 54% decrease in melted product sales volume, and changes in product mix. Mill product selling prices increased 2% (expressed in U.S. dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods) while melted product selling prices decreased 5%. In billing currencies (which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation), mill product selling prices decreased 1% from the year-ago period. The Company recognized $10.5 million of other operating income in the third quarter of 2002 related to the take-or-pay provisions of its purchase and supply agreement with Boeing. As compared to the second quarter of 2002, mill product sales volume in the third quarter of 2002 decreased 6%, while selling prices expressed in U.S. dollars decreased 1%. In billing currencies, mill product selling prices decreased approximately 4%. Melted product sales volume increased 1% in the third quarter of 2002 as compared to the second quarter of 2002, while melted product selling prices decreased 3% during such period. The Company's backlog at the end of September 2002 was approximately $165 million compared to $145 at the end of June 2002 and $315 million at the end of September 2001. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized on a periodic basis, but instead is subject to a two-step impairment test to be performed on at least an annual basis. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the transitional impairment testing of goodwill during the third quarter of 2002 and determined that the entire $44.3 million balance of the Company's goodwill existing on January 1, 2002 was impaired. In accordance with the transition requirements of SFAS No. 142, the Company reported this non-cash impairment charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2002, which is reflected in the Company's results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. There is no income tax benefit associated with this charge.
J. Landis Martin, Chairman and CEO, said, "We expect sales revenue for the full year 2002 to range from $360 million to $370 million and to report a loss, before changes in accounting principles and other special items, of between $45 million and $50 million. We are continuing our efforts to bring costs more in line with current business levels. In the third quarter of 2002, we reduced the operating rate at our sponge production facility and took actions to reduce our worldwide employment levels by approximately 13%. Other actions to reduce costs and working capital will be implemented over the next several months." Mr. Martin continued, "Our outlook for 2003 is for a continued difficult business environment reflecting the severe downturn in the commercial aerospace industry and sluggish economy. The commercial aerospace sector is the major source of demand for our products. Early indications are that our sales revenue and financial results during 2003, excluding special items, may be similar to 2002. However, we are conscious of the meaningful risks posed by the continuing war on terrorism, and potential for conflicts in the Middle East and with Iraq. These and other adverse world events could prolong and exacerbate the downturn in the commercial aerospace industry and have broader economic consequences." The Company recently amended its existing revolving credit agreement with Congress Financial Corporation (Southwest) extending the maturity date to February 2006. Under the terms of the amendment, maximum borrowings of $90 million are limited to a formula-determined borrowing base derived from the value of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. The amended credit agreement continues to contain provisions and covenants similar to those previously in effect and customary in lending transactions of this type. The Company's various European credit facilities remain in place. The Company presently has unused borrowing availability under its various U.S. and European credit agreements of approximately $115 million. Although the Company presently has substantial credit availability, given the uncertainties surrounding present industry conditions, the Company is considering exercising its right under the terms of its Convertible Preferred Securities to defer future dividend payments on these securities. These securities permit deferral of dividend payments for up to 20 consecutive quarters, although interest will continue to accrue at the coupon rate on the principal and unpaid dividends. The Company is also studying the possibility of a reverse stock split. A decision on the dividend deferral is expected in the next few days while an announcement on the reverse stock split will be made after the evaluation is complete.
The statements in this release and the conference call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that represent management's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "believes," "intends," "may," "will," "looks," "should," "could," "anticipates," "expects" or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies or trends. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Actual future results could differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements, and the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the cyclicality of the commercial aerospace industry, the performance of aerospace manufacturers and the Company under their long-term agreements, the difficulty in forecasting demand for titanium products, global economic and political conditions, global productive capacity for titanium, changes in product pricing and costs, the impact of long-term contracts with vendors on the ability of the Company to reduce or increase supply or achieve lower costs, the possibility of labor disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, control by certain stockholders and possible conflicts of interest, uncertainties associated with new product development, the supply of raw materials and services, changes in raw material and other operating costs (including energy costs), possible disruption of business or increases in the cost of doing business resulting from war or terrorist activities and other risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks materialize (or the consequences of such a development worsen), or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from those forecasted or expected. The Company assumes no duty to update any forward-looking statements. The financial information contained in this release is subject to future correction and revision and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as each may be amended from time to time, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
