EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: CONTACT: Titanium Metals Corporation J. Landis Martin 1999 Broadway, Suite 4300 Chairman, President, Denver, Colorado 80202 & Chief Executive Officer (303) 296-5600 TIMET ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO DEVELOP NEW TITANIUM TECHNOLOGY DENVER, COLORADO . . . April 4, 2003 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation ("TIMET") (NYSE: TIE) announced today that it has been selected by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA") to receive approximately $12.3 million in government funding over the next four years to lead a program aimed at commercializing the "FFC Cambridge Process." The FFC Cambridge Process, developed by Dr. Derek Fray and others at the University of Cambridge, represents a potential breakthrough technology in the process of extracting titanium from titanium-bearing ores. As part of the program, TIMET will be leading a team of scientists from major defense contractors, including General Electric Aircraft Engines, United Defense Limited Partners and Pratt & Whitney (a division of United Technologies Corporation), as well as the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Cambridge. In connection with the program, TIMET has negotiated a development and production license for the FFC Cambridge Process technology from British Titanium plc. TIMET will conduct the development work at its technical laboratory in Henderson, Nevada. Commenting on the program, J. Landis Martin, TIMET's Chairman, President & CEO, said, "TIMET is very honored that its proposal to lead this development effort was selected by DARPA after consideration of a wide variety of submissions from other leading companies in this field. While there is a great deal of work to be done and success is by no means a certainty, we see this as a very significant opportunity, working with some of the leading minds in titanium metallurgy, to achieve a truly meaningful reduction in the cost of producing titanium metal. If successful, we believe this would not only make titanium a more attractive material choice within the aerospace industry, but also open the doors to many new opportunities to use titanium in other non-aerospace applications where its cost might have been an obstacle." TIMET, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading worldwide producer of titanium metal products. Information on TIMET is available on the internet at www.timet.com. o o o o o
