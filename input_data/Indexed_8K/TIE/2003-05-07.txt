COMMENCES TENDER OFFER FOR CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF --------------------------------------------------------------------------- TIMET CAPITAL TRUST I --------------------- DENVER, COLORADO . . . May 7, 2003 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation (NYSE: TIE) announced that on May 5, 2003, Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 1,000,000 of the 6?% Convertible Preferred Securities, Beneficial Unsecured Convertible Securities (trading symbol "TMCXP") issued by TIMET Capital Trust I. The tender offer is at a net price of $10 per security. The securities include the associated guarantee by TIMET. There are currently 4,024,820 securities outstanding. Each security is convertible into 0.1339 shares of TIMET common stock, par value $.01 per share. The tender offer expires at 12:00 midnight New York time on June 2, 2003, unless extended by Valhi. The terms and conditions of the tender offer appear in Valhi's Offer to Purchase dated May 5, 2003, and the related Letter of Transmittal. Copies of these documents are being mailed to holders of the securities and are also available on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. Completion of the tender offer is conditioned upon certain terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase. Subject to applicable law, Valhi may waive any condition applicable to the tender offer, and Valhi may extend or otherwise amend the tender offer. Based on a review by TIMET's non-employee directors not related to Valhi, TIMET has determined that neither TIMET, its board of directors nor any of its officers will express an opinion or make any recommendation to any holder of the securities, and TIMET and all of such persons will remain neutral toward the tender offer. TIMET believes that a holder's decision on whether or not to tender such holder's securities and, if so, how many securities to tender, is a personal investment decision for each holder, based on such holder's personal investment objectives. TIMET believes that each holder should discuss this investment decision with such holder's financial and tax advisors. TIMET, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading worldwide producer of titanium metal products. Information on TIMET is available on the Internet at www.timet.com. o o o o o
