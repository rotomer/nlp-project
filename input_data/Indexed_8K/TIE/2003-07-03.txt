EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: CONTACT: Titanium Metals Corporation Robert E. Musgraves 1999 Broadway, Suite 4300 Chief Operating Officer (N. Am.) Denver, Colorado 80202 (303) 296-5600 TIMET APPLAUDS DECISION TO RETAIN TITANIUM SPONGE TARIFFS DENVER, COLORADO . . . July 3, 2003 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation (NYSE: TIE) announced that on July 1, 2003, the President of the United States denied a petition filed by the Government of Kazakhstan that would have allowed titanium sponge to be imported duty free into the United States from Kazakhstan and Russia. TIMET's Henderson, Nevada sponge operations represent the last remaining titanium sponge production of any size in the United States. As a result, the normal 15% tariff will continue to apply to all imports of titanium sponge into the U.S. J. Landis Martin, TIMET's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased with the President's decision to retain duties on titanium sponge, as the elimination of those duties would have made it even more difficult for TIMET to compete effectively in the currently depressed market for titanium products." In addition, according to Martin, "TIMET believes the President's decision reflects a recognition by the country's leadership of the importance of preserving a viable domestic source of titanium sponge in the United States as a critical part of our national defense infrastructure." Martin concluded, "We express our gratitude for the support we received on this issue from a broad, bipartisan group of Members of Congress who shared this view regarding the need to maintain our domestic capability to produce titanium sponge." TIMET, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading worldwide producer of titanium metal products. Information on TIMET is available on the Internet at www.timet.com. o o o o o
