EXHIBIT 99.1 U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION Los Angeles District Office 255 EAST TEMPLE STREET, 4TH FLOOR LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA 90012 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Gregory Gochanour July 7, 2003 Acting Regional Attorney (312) 886-9124 OR TIMET: Joan Prusse General Counsel (303) 296-5600 EEOC AND TIMET SETTLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUIT **************** Settlement Includes Anti-Discrimination Training and Monitoring of Company LAS VEGAS - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Titanium Metals Corporation ("TIMET") today announced the settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit against TIMET, filed on September 29, 2000 on behalf of six female former and current employees of TIMET's Henderson, NV facility. Without admitting any liability in the lawsuit, under the settlement TIMET has agreed it will not permit unlawful sexual harassment or retaliation, will conduct comprehensive anti-discrimination training, and has agreed to record-keeping and reporting obligations to be monitored by the EEOC over the duration of the two year term of the Settlement Agreement. The EEOC's lawsuit alleged that current and former female employees were sexually harassed by supervisors or co-workers at the TIMET facility in Henderson, Nevada and certain were retaliated against. The litigation was filed in the U.S. District Court, District of Nevada in September, 2000 (EEOC v. Titanium Metals Corporation, Inc. d/b/a TIMET, CV S-00-1172 JCM (RJJ)). "Sexual harassment is still a serious problem in the U.S. workforce that employers should pay attention to," said Gregory Gochanour, Acting Regional Attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District Office. "EEOC guidelines and Supreme Court rulings make it crystal clear that employers are responsible for taking swift action to address and correct sexual harassment once they become aware of it."
JOINT EEOC AND TIMET PRESS RELEASE - Page 2 Peter F. Laura, a Senior Trial Attorney of the EEOC's Los Angeles District Office, said: "We have seen substantial improvement in the way TIMET handles sexual harassment complaints in the last few years. We expect that to continue." TIMET's General Counsel, Joan Prusse, said: "TIMET has always been committed to a workplace that is free of unlawful sexual harassment and retaliation, and we are pleased to have reached a settlement that enables us to put this lawsuit behind us and avoid the time and expense of further legal proceedings." TIMET, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading worldwide producer of titanium metal products. Information on TIMET is available on the internet at www.timet.com. In addition to enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin, the EEOC enforces the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Pay Act and sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
