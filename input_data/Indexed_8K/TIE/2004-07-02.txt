INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press release dated July 2, 2004 issued by Titanium Metals Corporation
EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: CONTACT: Titanium Metals Corporation Bruce P. Inglis 1999 Broadway, Suite 4300 Vice President - Finance Denver, Colorado 80202 and Corporate Controller (303) 296-5600 TIMET RESPONDS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT TRADE DECISION DENVER, COLORADO . . . July 2, 2004 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation ("TIMET" or the "Company") (NYSE:TIE) has learned that the Administration has again postponed action on the petition filed by TIMET to terminate favorable U.S. tariff benefits on titanium wrought products imported into the United States from Russia under the Generalized System of Preferences ("GSP"), which allows Russia's favorable tariff treatment on imports of these products into the U.S. to continue. The petition was also filed by RTI International Metals, Inc. and had the support of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, the other two significant domestic producers of titanium products besides TIMET. This is the second year in which action on this petition has been deferred. Under the GSP program, the Administration has the authority to suspend normal trade tariffs on imports of designated products from certain developing countries. This program was designed to provide small producers in these developing countries with better access to the U.S. market as a substitute for direct foreign aid. The GSP program contains safeguards designed to protect the relevant domestic industry by reinstating normal trade tariffs when foreign imports have grown to a certain size. However, these safeguards were previously waived by the Administration with respect to the import of Russian titanium mill products, again over the objection of the principal U.S. titanium manufacturers. The Administration has also postponed action on the request of the domestic industry to reinstate these normal statutory protections. J. Landis Martin, Chairman, President & CEO of TIMET, stated: "We are disappointed that the Administration has apparently decided to continue to allow favorable trade benefits to be afforded to imports of Russian titanium mill products, despite the very strong objections of the three largest U.S. titanium producers, companies representing a total of approximately 10,000 U.S. employees. The U.S. industry was severely impacted by the significant downturn in the commercial aerospace market after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and has suffered substantial losses over the last three years. The continued increase in foreign titanium mill product imports from Russia that has been fostered by these trade benefits has hurt our weakened U.S. industry even further. We believe Russian imports now represent over 20% of the U.S. market for titanium wrought products. We feel this is a misuse of the GSP program to the detriment of the U.S. industry and its workers." Martin continued, "We appreciate and want to express our gratitude for the strong support the U.S. titanium industry has received in this process from a broad spectrum of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, from key elements within the Administration, and from our own employees. While we are disappointed by this decision, we have been given some indication that the Administration intends to continue to monitor titanium imports. We will continue to press for elimination of these tariff benefits to foreign producers because they threaten the health and well-being of the strategically important, U.S. titanium industry." TIMET, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading worldwide producer of titanium metal products. Information on TIMET is available on the Company's website at http://www.timet.com. o o o o o
