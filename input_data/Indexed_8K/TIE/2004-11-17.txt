Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01 Entry into Material Definitive Agreement. On November 12, 2004, TIMET UK Ltd. ("TIMET UK"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Titanium Metals Corporation ("TIMET"), entered into three new leases with The Prudential Assurance Company Limited ("Prudential") for TIMET UK's principal facilities located in Witton, England. The two leases for TIMET UK's manufacturing facilities each have a term of 20 years, and the lease for TIMET UK's office space has a term of 10 years. TIMET UK pays aggregate rent of approximately (pound)752,580 per year for the three leases, which amount is subject to adjustment every five years at a rate of 2.0% per annum, compounded annually. The first rent payment under the new leases is not due until October 2006. The leases are substantially identical in form, and a form of lease is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by this reference. Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. Contemporaneously with entering into the new leases described in Item 1.01, TIMET UK and Prudential agreed to terminate the previously effective leases for the same facilities. The previously effective leases permitted TIMET to terminate the leases at the end of 2006 or 2016, while the new leases do not contain a similar termination right. Under the previously effective leases, TIMET UK's aggregate rental rate was approximately (pound)663,224 per year, which amount was subject to adjustment every five years based upon changes in the Retail Prices Index for all items excluding housing as published by HM Government's relevant statistics office, with the next adjustment scheduled for February 2006. TIMET agreed to the new rental rate and lease terms under the new leases in exchange for the abatement of rental payments until October 2006 and the fixed rent escalation provision.
