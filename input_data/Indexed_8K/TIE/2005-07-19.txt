EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: CONTACT: Titanium Metals Corporation Bruce P. Inglis 1999 Broadway, Suite 4300 Vice President - Finance and Denver, Colorado 80202 Corporate Controller (303) 296-5600 TIMET UPDATES 2005 FULL YEAR GUIDANCE DENVER, COLORADO . . . July 18, 2005 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation ("TIMET" or the "Company") (NYSE: TIE) announced it currently expects full year 2005 sales revenue to range between $730 million and $760 million, a $30 million increase from previous guidance, reflecting higher average selling prices than previously forecasted. Full year 2005 operating income is expected to increase $53 million over previous guidance, to between $123 million and $138 million. The increase in operating income relates to the projected sales revenue increase as well as lower than previously expected raw material costs. Full year 2005 net income attributable to common stockholders is now projected to range between $117 million and $132 million, an increase of $37 million from previous guidance. The projected net income attributable to common stockholders includes (i) a $13.9 million non-operating gain on the sale of certain property and (ii) a $25.9 million income tax benefit recognized during the first quarter of 2005. At the upper end of the current forecasted levels, 2005 would be a record year for TIMET. The outlook for the titanium industry remains positive, and the Company believes that its business will continue to benefit from sustained market demand. TIMET also announced that it currently intends to report its second quarter 2005 results after close of business on August 1, 2005. This release contains forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in TIMET's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TIMET, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading worldwide producer of titanium metal products. Information on TIMET is available on its website at www.timet.com. o o o o o
