EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: CONTACT: Titanium Metals Corporation Bruce P. Inglis 1999 Broadway, Suite 4300 Vice President - Finance and Denver, Colorado 80202 Corporate Controller (303) 296-5600 TIMET REPORTS NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER 2005 DENVER, COLORADO . . . August 1, 2005 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation ("TIMET" or the "Company") (NYSE: TIE) reported operating income of $36.9 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $33.6 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, compared to operating income of $8.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $3.4 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. The 2004 amounts have been restated for the effects of the Company's previously reported change in its method for inventory costing. The Company's net sales increased 48% to $183.7 million during the second quarter of 2005 compared to net sales of $124.1 million during the year-ago period, due to increases in both average selling prices and sales volumes. Mill product average selling prices increased 27% and melted product average selling prices increased 30% during the second quarter of 2005, compared to the year-ago period. Mill product sales volume increased 15% while melted product sales volume increased 1% during the second quarter of 2005, compared to the year-ago period. Other non-mill product sales increased 73% compared to the year ago period due principally to higher selling prices for titanium scrap and improved demand for the Company's fabrication products. Such sales accounted for $6.7 million of additional operating income during the second quarter of 2005, as compared to the year ago period. Operating income during the second quarter of 2005 was adversely impacted by higher costs for raw materials and $2.5 million of additional costs related to the accrual of certain performance-based employee incentive compensation payments, as compared to the year ago period. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company modified its method of calculating its backlog to include purchase orders under consignment relationships. The Company believes inclusion of these orders provides a more accurate reflection of the Company's overall backlog. Using the modified methodology for all periods, the Company's backlog at the end of June 2005 was $580 million, a $90 million (18%) increase over the $490 million backlog at the end of March 2005 and a $260 million (81%) increase over the $320 million backlog at the end of June 2004. The Company's results in the second quarter of 2005 also include a $13.9 million pre-tax non-operating gain ($9.6 million, net of income taxes) related to the previously reported sale of certain property. In addition, the Company's results in the first six months of 2005 includes an aggregate $35.6 million ($5.7 million in the second quarter) income tax benefit related to the reversal of the Company's deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in the U.S. and the U.K.
The Company's aggregate unused borrowing availability under its U.S. and European credit agreements approximated $110 million at June 30, 2005. J. Landis Martin, Chairman and CEO, said, "We are pleased to report another solid quarter for TIMET. We continue to benefit from higher average selling prices for both melted and mill products, driven by increased customer demand for titanium across all markets. We also continue to believe that we are in the early stages of this business cycle and expect the current upward trend to continue through 2006 and beyond."
