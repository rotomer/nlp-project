Provided, however, that Boeing may elect to extend a Stop Work Order beyond the permitted [ * ] or [ * ], as applicable, [ * ] for an additional period of [ * ] provided that [ * ] during the Stop Work Order Period. In the event the Stop Work Order is canceled by Boeing or the period of the Stop Work Order (including any extension thereof) expires, Seller shall promptly resume work in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

Each Party shall make such persons available to meet with representatives of the other Party as soon as may be practicable following a request for any such meeting by a Party and shall make available to the other Party any additional information, reports or other materials in connection therewith as that Party may reasonably request. Boeing may request, by notice to Seller, written assurance (hereafter an "Assurance of Performance") with respect to any specific matters affecting Seller's performance hereunder, that Seller is able to perform all of its respective obligations under any Order when and as specified herein. Each Assurance of Performance shall be delivered by Seller to Boeing as promptly as possible, and each Assurance of Performance shall be accompanied by any information, reports or other materials, prepared by Seller, as Boeing may reasonably request. The Assurance of Performance would be created to address the specific matters identified by Boeing affecting Seller's performance, and would include mutually agreeable milestones for measuring Seller's improvement. The Assurance of Performance could include, as appropriate to the context, measures such as buffer programs; build-ahead plans; plans for providing Boeing with written notice of matters such as revised delivery schedules, work stoppages or significant changes in production flow; or subcontracting or off-loading plans. 18.0 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROPERTY Seller shall clearly mark, maintain an inventory of, and keep segregated or identifiable all of Boeing's property and all property to which Boeing has acquired an interest. Except as may be expressly agreed to by the Parties, Seller assumes all risk of loss, destruction or damage of such property while in Seller's or it's subcontractors' or suppliers' possession, custody or control. Upon request, Seller shall provide Boeing with adequate proof of insurance against such risk of loss where Seller (rather than Boeing) has assumed the risk of such loss. Seller shall not use such property other than in performance of an Order without prior written consent from Boeing. Seller shall notify Boeing's Procurement Representative if Boeing's property is lost, damaged or destroyed. As directed by Boeing, upon completion, termination or cancellation of the Contract or any Order, Seller shall deliver such property, to the extent not incorporated in delivered Products, to Boeing in good condition subject to ordinary wear and tear and normal manufacturing losses, and Seller's obligations under this Section with respect to such Property shall thereafter cease.

Boeing and Seller shall each use Proprietary Information and Materials of the other only in the performance of and for the purpose of this Contract and/or any Order. Provided, however, that despite any other obligations or restrictions imposed by this GTA Section 20.0, Boeing shall have the right to use, disclose and copy Seller's Proprietary Information and Materials for the purposes of testing, certification, use, sale, or support of any Product delivered under this GTA or an Order, or any airplane including such Product; and any such disclosure by Boeing shall, whenever appropriate, include a restrictive legend suitable to the particular circumstances. And further provided that all such use, disclosure, copying and the like shall be done in such a manner as to, and made only to such persons who have also agreed to, maintain Seller's Proprietary Information and Materials as confidential and protect the same from disclosure in accordance with the terms of the Contract. The restrictions on disclosure or use of Proprietary Information and Materials by a receiving Party shall apply to all materials derived by the receiving Party or others from the disclosing Party's Proprietary Information and Materials. The receiving Party will copy Proprietary Information and Materials received by it only as reasonably necessary for the purposes contemplated in the Contract. C. The Parties agree that without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto and except as may be required by law, the receiving Party shall hold in confidence and not disclose Proprietary Information and Materials received by it, except to representatives of the receiving Party who require such Proprietary Information and Materials for purposes of the Contract and who agree to maintain such Proprietary Information and Materials as confidential and protect the same from disclosure in accordance with the terms of the Contract. D. Upon the disclosing Party's request at any time, and in any event upon the completion, termination or cancellation of the Contract, the receiving Party shall return all of the disclosing Party's Proprietary Information and Materials, and all copies thereof and all materials derived therefrom to the disclosing Party within [ * ] of the written demand of the disclosing Party unless specifically directed otherwise in writing by the disclosing Party; provided, however, that the receiving Party may retain as many copies of the Proprietary Information as shall be necessary to fully effect the purpose and intent of this Contract and support commitments to Boeing customers and end users which copies shall be held in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Contract. E. Seller shall not, without the prior written authorization of Boeing, sell or otherwise dispose of (as scrap or otherwise) any parts or other materials containing, conveying, embodying, or made in accordance with or by reference to any Proprietary Information and Materials of Boeing. Prior to disposing of such parts or materials as scrap, Seller shall render them unusable. Boeing shall have the right to audit Seller's compliance with this GTA Section 20.0. F. Seller may copy and disclose Proprietary Information and Materials of Boeing for use with Seller's subcontractors or suppliers or "ship-to" customers as required for the performance of its obligations under this Contract, provided that all such use, disclosure, copying and the like shall be done in such a manner as to, and made only to such persons who have also agreed to, maintain Boeing's Proprietary Information and Materials as confidential and protect the same from disclosure in accordance with the terms of the Contract; and Seller shall be liable to Boeing for any breach of such obligation by such subcontractor. G. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 20 to the contrary, either Party may make disclosure of the Contract to (a) any of its accountants, auditors or lawyers or in Seller's case to Seller's controlling shareholder having a need to know such information provided such person agrees not to disclose the information to any other person or outside of such firm, except as disclosure is required by applicable law, regulation or court order and (b) any of its bankers or credit rating agencies having a need to know such information, provided persons at such companies agree in writing not to disclose the information to any other person or outside of such company, except as disclosure is required by applicable law, regulation or court order. The foregoing shall not apply to matters already public other than by reason of a breach of this Section 20. Seller may also file such reports (including, without limitation, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K) regarding or containing information about the Contract or any provisions thereof that Seller shall deem necessary or prudent under applicable laws and regulations after giving good faith consideration to the protection of Boeing proprietary information. Seller may also file a copy of the Contract as an exhibit to any such report filed by Seller, provided that Seller shall, in good faith, give due consideration to redacting Boeing proprietary information from these documents. Seller shall also provide Boeing with a written copy of these documents as redacted prior to their filing, with sufficient time for Boeing to submit additional, suggested redactions. Seller shall give good faith consideration to inclusion of such Boeing suggested redactions before filing the documents. Seller may discuss matters pertaining to the Contract in investor calls to the extent such matters are specifically reported in either Seller's press release or any other report publicly made by Seller. The Parties specifically intend that the filing of such reports by Seller shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 20.0 or of Seller's obligations under the Contract, provided that the provisions of this Section 20.0 (G) are met. H. If the receiving Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Proprietary Information and Materials of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party will advise and consult with the disclosing Party prior to any such disclosure, so that the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the Contract. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or compliance with the Contract is waived as above, the receiving Party will disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information and Materials which the receiving Party is advised by counsel is legally required and the receiving Party will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such of the Proprietary Information and Materials as is disclosed. Any disclosure made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 20.0 shall not be regarded as a breach of the obligations of the receiving Party pursuant to the Contract. I. Nothing in this Section 20.0 shall be construed as granting or conveying to the receiving Party any right or license to use Proprietary Information and Materials of the disclosing Party (except for the purposes contemplated in the Contract) or to practice any inventions described and claimed in any pending patent applications or issued patents which are owned or controlled by the disclosing Party relating to such Proprietary Information and Materials. J. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the other Party could be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Section 20.0 are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 20.0 and to enforce specifically the terms of this Section 20.0. K. The provisions of this GTA Section 20.0 are effective in lieu of, and will apply notwithstanding the absence of, any restrictive legends or notices applied to Proprietary Information and Materials; and the provisions of this GTA Section 20.0 shall survive the performance, completion, termination or cancellation of the Contract or any Order. Except as provided below, this GTA Section 20.0 supersedes and replaces any and all other prior agreements or understandings between the Parties to the extent that such agreements or understandings relate to the receiving Party's obligations relative to confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information, or tangible items containing, conveying, or embodying such information, obtained from the disclosing Party and related to any Product, regardless of whether disclosed to the receiving Party before or after the effective date of the Contract. The provisions of this GTA Section 20.0 do not supersede and replace the following agreements between the Parties: (a) Proprietary Information Agreement effective as of May 2, 2003; (2) Proprietary Information Agreement effective as of August 2, 2005, both related to certain proprietary financial information of Seller. 21.0 COMPLIANCE 21.1 Compliance With Laws Boeing and Seller shall each be responsible for complying with all legal requirements, including, but not limited to the provisions of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, permit, approval, license or registration applicable to its performance under this GTA. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any aspect of the first Party's performance that is prohibited under any legal requirements, at the earliest opportunity, but in all events sufficiently in advance of the first Party's performance of such obligation, so as to identify and implement alternative methods of performance. Each Party shall notify the other Party in writing at the earliest possible opportunity of any aspect of its performance, which becomes subject to any additional legal requirement after the date of execution of this GTA or which the first Party reasonably believes will become subject to additional regulation during the term of this Agreement. Seller agrees to indemnify and to hold harmless Boeing from any failure by Seller to comply with any legal requirement related to Seller's performance of the GTA or the SBP. 21.2 Government Requirements If any of the work to be performed under the GTA is performed in the United States, Seller shall, via invoice or other form satisfactory to Boeing, certify that the Products covered by the Order were produced in compliance with Sections 6, 7, and 12 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 201-291), as amended, and the regulations and orders of the U.S. Department of Labor issued thereunder. In addition, the following Federal Acquisition Regulations are incorporated herein by this reference except "Contractor" shall mean "Seller": Other Government clauses, if any, are incorporated herein either by attachment to this document or by some other means of reference. FAR 52.222-26 "Equal Opportunity" FAR 52.222-35 "Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era" FAR 52.222-36 "Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities" FAR 52.247-64 "Preference for Privately Owned U.S.-Flagged Commercial Vessels" 21.3 Ethic Requirements/Code of Conduct Boeing is committed to conducting its business fairly, impartially, and in an ethical and proper manner. Boeing expectation is that Seller will also conduct its business fairly, impartially and in an ethical and proper manner. Boeing further expects that Seller will have (or will develop) and adhere to a code of ethical standards. If Seller has cause to believe that Boeing or any employee or agent of Boeing has behaved improperly or unethically under this contract, Seller shall report such conduct to The Boeing Company Ethics hotline. Copies of The Boeing Company Code of Conduct and contacts for such reports are available on www.boeing.com under "Ethics and Business Conduct." Although Boeing will not use the failure to report improper or unethical behavior as a basis for claiming breach of contract by Seller, Seller is encouraged to exert reasonable efforts to report such behavior when warranted. 22.0 INTEGRITY IN PROCUREMENT Seller warrants that neither it nor any of its employees, agents or representatives have offered or given, or will offer or give any gratuities to Boeing's employees, agents or representatives for the purpose of securing any Order or securing favorable treatment under any Order. 23.0 UTILIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS Boeing encourages Seller to actively seek out and provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, minority business enterprises, historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions, historically underutilized business zone small business concerns and U.S. veteran and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the subcontracts Seller awards to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient performance of this contract. 24.0 BOEING'S RIGHTS IN SELLER'S PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, AND TOOLING Subject to the terms and conditions enumerated within this GTA Section 24.0, and provided Boeing is not in breach of this Contract, Seller hereby grants to Boeing [ * ] license [ * ] (collectively hereinafter referred to as "Licensed Property") related to the [ * ]. Boeing hereafter retains all of the aforementioned license rights in Licensed Property, but Boeing hereby covenants not to exercise such rights except in connection with the [ * ] or products of the same kind, provided that such exercise of rights is limited exclusively to the manufacture of parts or assemblies [ * ], provided, that such undelivered quantity of [ * ] cannot, in Boeing's sole determination, be reasonably obtained in the required time frame at a reasonable price from commercially available sources (including Boeing) without the use of Seller's Licensed Property and if one or more of the following situations occur: A. Seller discontinues or suspends business operations or the production of any or all of the [ * ] B. Seller is acquired by or transfers any or all of its rights to manufacture any Product to any third party in violation of the provisions of GTA Section 28.3, whether or not related, without Boeing's prior written concurrence where such written concurrence is required; C. Boeing cancels this Contract as a result of Seller's breach pursuant to GTA Section 13.0 herein; D. In Boeing's judgment it becomes necessary, in order for Seller to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any Order, for Boeing to provide support to Seller (in the form of design, manufacturing, or on-site personnel assistance) substantially in excess of that which Boeing normally provides to its suppliers; E. Seller's trustee in bankruptcy (or Seller as debtor in possession) fails to assume this Contract and all Orders for [ * ] by formal entry of an order in the bankruptcy court within [ * ] after entry of an order for relief in a bankruptcy case of the Seller, or Boeing elects to retain its rights to Licensed Property under the bankruptcy laws; F. Seller is at any time insolvent (whether measured under a balance sheet test or by the failure to pay debts as they come due) or the subject of any insolvency or debt assignment proceeding under state or non-bankruptcy law; or G. Seller voluntarily becomes a debtor in any case under bankruptcy law or, in the event an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against Seller, such petition is not dismissed within [ * ] Provided, however, that Boeing's exercise of the license granted hereby shall be further limited to each and all of the following terms and conditions: 1. Boeing may sublicense its rights granted hereby to only one sublicensee at a given time. 2. The duration of the license granted hereby shall be limited to the duration of the Contract. Boeing shall not be obligated, but may choose in its sole and absolute discretion, to resume purchasing from Seller any Product for which Boeing has exercised rights with respect to Licensed Property hereunder. Provided, however, that if Seller ceases to be a going concern the duration of the license granted hereby shall be indefinite. 3. If Seller has ceased to manufacture [ * ] unrelated to any of the circumstances outlined in GTA Section 24.0 A. through F. above, Boeing agrees that, prior to exercising any license rights granted hereby, it will enter into good faith negotiations with Seller. As a part of the license granted under this GTA Section 24.0, Seller shall, at the written request of Boeing and at no additional cost to Boeing, promptly deliver to Boeing any and all Licensed Property considered by Boeing to be necessary to satisfy Boeing's requirements for [ * ] and their substitutes. 25.0 TERMINATION OF AIRPLANE PROGRAM 25.1 Program Termination Not Applicable. 25.2 Termination Liability Not Applicable. 26.0 PUBLICITY Without Boeing's prior written approval, Seller shall not, and shall require that its subcontractors or suppliers shall not, release any publicity, advertisement, news release or denial or confirmation of the same, regarding any Order or Products, or the program to which they may pertain. Seller shall be liable to Boeing for any breach of such obligation by any subcontractor or supplier. 27.0 PROPERTY INSURANCE 27.1 Insurance Seller shall obtain and maintain continuously in effect a property insurance policy covering loss or destruction of or damage to all property in which Boeing has an insurable interest pursuant to this GTA, including but not limited to Tooling, Boeing-furnished property, raw materials, parts, work-in-process, incomplete or completed assemblies and all other products or parts thereof, and all drawings, specifications, data and other materials relating to any of the foregoing in each case to the extent in the possession or under the effective care, custody or control of Seller or any agent, employee, affiliate, subcontractor or supplier of Seller, in the amount of (i) full replacement value thereof if the property is replaced or remade (except in the case of work-in-process property, which shall be insured and replaceable at cost, including variable and overhead costs) or (ii) in the amount of the "cash value" thereof (equal to the replacement cost less depreciation) if the property is not replaced or remade but a cash settlement is accepted; providing protection against all perils normally covered in an "all risk" property insurance policy (including without limitation fire, windstorm, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, earthquake, flood or other acts of God) and subject to exclusions that are standard in such "all risk" property insurance policies. Any such policy shall be with insurers reasonably acceptable to Boeing and shall (a) provide for payment of loss there under to Boeing, as loss payee, as its interests may appear and (b) contain a waiver of any rights of subrogation against Boeing, its subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents. 27.2 Certificate of Insurance Upon written request from Boeing, Seller shall provide to Boeing's Procurement Representative certificates of insurance reflecting full compliance with the requirements set forth in GTA Section 27.1. Such certificates shall be kept current and in compliance throughout the period of this Agreement and shall provide for [ * ] advanced written notice, ([ * ] advanced written notice in the case of cancellation due to non-payment of premium) to Boeing's Procurement Representative in the event of cancellation, non-renewal or material change adversely affecting the interests of Boeing. 27.3 Notice of Damage or Loss Seller shall give prompt written notice to Boeing's Procurement Representative of the occurrence of any damage or loss to any property required to be insured herein. If any such property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by an insured peril or otherwise, and if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then Seller may, upon written notice to Boeing, settle, adjust, or compromise any and all such loss or damage not in excess of [ * ] in any one occurrence and [ * ] in the aggregate. Seller may settle, adjust or compromise any other claim by Seller only after Boeing has given written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 28.0 RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERFORMANCE Seller may elect to supply the Products from any of Seller's qualified facilities as it may reasonably determine, consistent with the commercial, technical, legal and regulatory requirements of Boeing. Provided that in exercising its right of supply under this Section 28.0, Seller shall be responsible for all additional costs or charges (including, without limitation, additional shipping costs, duties, taxes and the like) that result from Seller's election to supply any Products from such of Seller's facilities as have not been among the traditional supply facilities for such Products. Seller shall notify Boeing prior to moving work to be performed under the Contract between Seller's various facilities. Seller shall include as part of its subcontracts those applicable provisions of the Contract that protect Boeing's rights including but not limited to right of entry provisions, proprietary information and rights provisions and quality control provisions. In addition, Seller shall provide to its subcontractor's sufficient information to document clearly that the work being performed by Seller's subcontractor is to facilitate performance under the Contract or any Order. Sufficient information may include but is not limited to Order number, GTA number or the name of Boeing's Procurement Representative. 28.1 Subcontracting Seller shall maintain complete and accurate records regarding all subcontracted items and/or processes. Seller's use of subcontractors or suppliers shall comply with Seller's quality assurance system approval for said subcontractors or suppliers. Seller agrees not to purchase any completed or substantially completed Products from a non-Boeing-approved source as identified in Boeing's Quality systems. No subcontracting by Seller shall relieve Seller of its obligation under the applicable Order. Utilization of a Boeing-approved source does not constitute a waiver of Seller's responsibility to meet all Specification requirements. 28.2 Reliance Seller will not deny any responsibility or obligation hereunder to Boeing provided recommendations or assistance in any phase of the work involved in producing or supporting the Products, including but not limited to Boeing's acceptance of Specifications, test data or the Products. 28.3 Assignment Except as provided in GTA Section 28.1 "Subcontracting" Seller shall not assign any of its rights or interest in this GTA or the SBP, or subcontract or delegate all or substantially all of its performance of this GTA or the SBP, without Boeing's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Seller may assign its right to monies due or to become due. No assignment, delegation or subcontracting by Seller, with or without Boeing's consent, shall relieve Seller of any of its obligations under this GTA, the SBP or any Order or prejudice any rights of Boeing against Seller whether arising before or after the date of any assignment. This GTA Section 28.3 shall not limit Seller's ability to purchase standard commercial supplies or raw material. Without Boeing's prior written consent, Seller may engage in or be subject to any of the following, which shall not be deemed an "assignment" under the provisions of this GTA Section 28.3 [ * ]: (a) Seller shall promptly notify Boeing in writing of such transaction or occurrence. (b) Boeing may request, within [ * ] of receiving such notice, that Seller and the third party provide Boeing with such information as Boeing reasonably requests about the third party and the transaction or occurrence. (c) Within [ * ] after receipt of such information, Boeing shall in good faith determine whether the third party is a [ * ] (defined below). (d) If Boeing reasonably determines the third party is a Disqualified Person, it may also notify Seller at that time that it has elected to terminate the Contract. If Boeing does not terminate the Contract within such [ * ] period, it will be deemed to have waived its right to terminate the Contract under this GTA Section 28.3. (e) If Boeing terminates the Contract pursuant to its rights under this GTA Section 28.3, neither Party shall owe the other Party any amounts resulting from the termination. Boeing's notice of termination may specify that Seller and Boeing will continue to perform under the Contract for a period not to exceed [ * ] following the date of Boeing's notice of termination. [ * ] 29.0 NON-WAIVER/PARTIAL INVALIDITY Any failures, delays or forbearances of either Party in insisting upon or enforcing any provisions of any Order, or in exercising any rights or remedies under this GTA, shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any such provisions, rights or remedies; rather, the same shall remain in full force and effect. No acceptance of partial payment or performance of any obligation hereunder shall constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or a waiver or release of payment or performance in full of any such obligation. If any provision of any Order is or becomes void or unenforceable by law, the remainder shall be valid and enforceable. 30.0 HEADINGS Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenient reference only and do not affect the interpretation of the Agreement. 31.0 RESERVED 32.0 RESERVED 33.0 DISPUTES Boeing and Seller shall use their best reasonable efforts to resolve any and all disputes, controversies, claims or differences between Boeing and Seller, arising out of or relating in any way to this GTA or its performance, including, but not limited to, any questions regarding the existence, validity or termination hereof ("Disputes"), through negotiation. If a Dispute cannot be resolved by the functional representatives of Boeing and Seller, it shall be referred up through management channels of the Parties or their respective designees, for further negotiation. Any dispute that arises under or is related to this Agreement that cannot be settled by mutual agreement of the parties shall be resolved only as provided in SBP Section 5. Pending final resolution of any Dispute, Seller shall proceed with performance of this GTA according to Boeing's instructions so long as Boeing continues to pay amounts not in dispute. 34.0 RESERVED 35.0 TAXES 35.1 Inclusion of [ * ] Unless parties agree otherwise, [ * ]. Seller shall be responsible for any taxes based upon Seller's net or gross income, gross receipts, capital, or equity arising from Seller's sales under the Contract. With regard to value added taxes (VAT) imposed on or measured by this Agreement, Seller and Boeing also agree to work together to administer VAT so that it can be reclaimed if legally possible. If VAT cannot be reclaimed via reasonable business means and the VAT charge is directly related to the unilateral selection of title transfer and delivery location by Boeing, Boeing will be responsible for that instance of VAT. [ * ]. Prices shall not include any taxes, impositions, charges or exactions for which Boeing has furnished a valid exemption certificate or other evidence of exemption. 35.2 Litigation In the event that any taxing authority has claimed or does claim payment for sales taxes, Seller shall promptly notify Boeing, and Seller shall take such action as Boeing may direct to pay or protest such taxes or to defend against such claim. The actual and direct expenses, without the addition of profit and overhead, of such defense and the amount of such taxes as ultimately determined as due and payable shall be paid directly by Boeing or reimbursed to Seller. If Seller or Boeing is successful in defending such claim, the amount of such taxes recovered by Seller, which had previously been paid by Seller and reimbursed by Boeing or paid directly by Boeing, shall be immediately refunded to Boeing. 35.3 Rebates If any taxes paid by Boeing are subject to rebate or reimbursement, Seller shall take the necessary actions to secure such rebates or reimbursement and shall promptly refund to Boeing any amount recovered. The actual and direct expenses, without the addition of profit and overhead, of securing such rebates or reimbursement shall be paid directly by Boeing or reimbursed to Seller. 36.0 OFFSET CREDITS To the exclusion of all others, Boeing or its assignee shall be entitled to all industrial benefits or offset credits which might result from this GTA or any Order. Seller shall provide documentation or information, which Boeing or its assignee may reasonably request to substantiate claims for industrial benefits or offset credits. Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to identify the foreign content of goods, which Seller either produces itself or procures from other companies for work directly related to this GTA. Promptly after selection of a non-U.S. subcontractor or supplier for work under this GTA, Seller shall notify Boeing of the name, address, subcontract point of contact (including telephone number) and dollar value of the subcontract.

For any calendar year in which Boeing notifies Seller that the projected increase in Boeing's volume of Product would exceed the permitted [ * ], the amount by which the projected volume exceeds the permitted [ * ] will be added to the then-effective Boeing Minimum Volume and the sum of the two will become the new Boeing Minimum Volume for that calendar year. 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Boeing's purchased volume may increase at a greater [ * ] than otherwise allowed in SBP Section 10.0.F if such increase would be necessary in order for Boeing to purchase the Boeing Minimum Volume under Section 10.0.A. G. Boeing shall purchase a minimum volume of titanium mill products (vs. ingot or other melted titanium product) each calendar year (the "Mill Products Minimum") which volume shall be included in the Boeing Minimum Volume.

Total Cost Management Boeing and Seller agree to participate in a process herein known as Total Cost Management (TCM). Boeing and Seller may each identify cost reduction opportunities which shall be documented in a mutual written agreement, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to work together for implementation. Boeing and Seller shall review TCM opportunities on a periodic basis, which shall include the establishment of targets and implementation plans by specific written agreement of the Parties. Where Boeing and Seller identify TCM cost reductions, beyond those previously anticipated, identified and documented and reflected in the then-applicable Price for the Products, the Parties will determine the amount of savings that will result from the improvements and share the savings on a basis that is weighted to the "owner" of the savings, net of development and implementation costs. All such programs will be covered by separate written agreements between the Parties. Seller suggestions disapproved by Boeing may be given consideration in achievement of TCM targets. B. Boeing Generated Technical and Cost Improvement At any time during the Seller's performance under this SBP, Boeing may offer specific recommendations to Seller for the incorporation of any new technologies and process improvements intended to reduce Seller's costs or improve Product performance. These recommendations may include, but are not limited to, Boeing proprietary information and Boeing owned patents. Notwithstanding any other provision(s) contained elsewhere in this SBP, if Seller has agreed to and implemented Boeing's recommendations and a cost savings is identified and documented as resulting therefrom, the Parties agree that if such savings was not previously anticipated, identified and documented and reflected in the then-applicable Price for the Products, the Parties will determine the amount of savings that has resulted from the improvements and share the savings on a basis that is weighted to the "owner" of the savings, net of development and implementation costs. All such programs will be covered by separate written agreements between the Parties. And provided, further, that any such recommendations made by Boeing and agreed to by Seller shall not modify any other provisions in this SBP unless expressly agreed to in writing by both Parties. C. Lean Manufacturing/Process Improvement With respect to any cost savings that result from any continuous improvement processes (such as lean manufacturing, SPC, preventative maintenance) that are agreed to in writing by the Parties and implemented with a view to achieving annual TCM cost reductions, if such savings was not previously anticipated, identified and documented and reflected in the then-applicable Price for the Products, such savings would be shared on a reciprocal basis weighted to the "owner" of the savings, net of development implementation costs. Seller and Boeing will identify programs and/or areas where costs may be reduced, agree in writing upon each such program to be implemented and on the baseline price/cost level against which each price/cost element shall be measured. All such programs will be covered by separate written agreements between the Parties. D. Cooperation on Research and Development Initiatives The Parties shall explore opportunities to work together on research and development programs that have been established by separate written agreements between the Parties. Such cooperation would be expected to include regular exchanges of pertinent information determined by each Party to be appropriate for such cooperative exchange. 12.7 Reserved. 12.8 Reserved. 12.9 Derivative Aircraft Not Applicable. 13.0 SPARES AND OTHER PRICING 13.1 Spares For purposes of SBP Section 13.0, the following requirements and definitions shall apply: A.
