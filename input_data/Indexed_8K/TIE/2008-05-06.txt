DALLAS, TEXAS . . . May 6, 2008 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET or the Company) (NYSE: TIE) reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $40.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared to $75.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.
The Companys net sales were $293.7 million during the first quarter of 2008 compared to $341.7 million during the first quarter of 2007.  Over the past year, increases in global titanium sponge capacity and manufacturing activity for titanium products have increased availability of titanium sponge and scrap, which has resulted in declining costs for these raw materials.  This recent decline in raw material costs, in turn, has contributed to lower selling prices for TIMETs products due in part to raw material indexed pricing adjustments under certain of the Companys long-term agreements, as well as contributing to lower selling prices for our non-contract sales volumes.
Various adjustments and delays in the build-out schedules of certain commercial aircraft have also contributed to near-term demand changes, impacting sales volumes and selling prices for titanium products during the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007.  The Company continues to emphasize selling higher grades of melted and mill products, which are generally less susceptible to pricing pressures resulting from demand fluctuations.  As a result of these factors, the Companys net sales volume for melted products declined 18% for the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, whereas the Companys net sales volume for mill products only declined 4% over the same periods.  Although the Company believes long-term demand trends continue to be favorable, recently announced changes in the production schedule for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner are expected to impact customer inventory levels and product mix and contribute to additional fluctuations in demand over the near term.

Operating income for the first quarter of 2008 was $62.8 million compared to $116.2 million during the same period in 2007.  Operating income was negatively affected by fluctuations in demand as well as increased costs of raw materials.  Although the Companys cost of purchased titanium sponge and scrap declined during the latter part of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, indexed pricing adjustments in certain long-term customer supply agreements typically precede the realization of lower product cost of sales due to the length of the manufacturing cycle for the production of melted and mill products.
The Companys sales order backlog at the end of March 2008 was $0.9 billion compared to $1.0 billion at the end of December 2007.
Steven L. Watson, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, While our results of operations in the first quarter of 2008 were below the record levels achieved in 2007, the long-term outlook for our business and the industry as a whole remain strong and we expect that future demand in all major market sectors will accelerate. We also believe the global commercial aerospace market will continue its long-term upward trend with the manufacture of new generation aircraft which require the use of significantly higher percentages of titanium.
The effect of industry capacity expansions currently underway, together with recently announced revisions in the production schedule for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and adjustments and delays in certain other commercial aircraft build-out schedules, have contributed to volatility in the overall market demand for aerospace products.  We have been successful over the last two years in establishing significant flexibility and cost advantages in our entire manufacturing process.  With our continuing strong positive cash flow and no debt, we believe TIMET is well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities.  Additionally, we believe that we are well positioned to respond to industry demand fluctuations in a timely and cost-efficient manner because we have assured and flexible availability of raw material supplies and conversion services, that includes a balance of internal resources and committed third party long-term supply and conversion services agreements.  We also have secured our position in key market sectors, such as the global aerospace jet engine market, through previously announced long-term customer agreements.  We continue to pursue strategic plans that focus on anticipated long-term favorable trends in demand by expanding our productive capacity, with a focus on additional opportunities to improve our operating flexibility, efficiency and cost structure.
