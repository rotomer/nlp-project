Section 15
1..  All payments will be made at Payees address at Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas   75240-2697,  Attention:  Treasurer, or such other place as the holder may from time to time appoint in writing.
Section 
  
Place of Payment
2..  The unpaid principal balance of this Note and any unpaid and accrued interest thereon shall be due and payable on December 31, 2011 or upon acceleration as provided herein.  Prior to the final payment of this Note, unpaid and accrued interest on the outstanding principal balance of this Note shall be due and payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year; that such day is a business day, and if such day is not a business day, the quarterly interest payment shall be due the next successive business day.
Section 
  
Payment
provided, however,
3..  This Note may be prepaid in part or in full at any time without penalty; prepayments shall be first applied to accrued and unpaid interest and then to principal.  The Maker shall not be entitled to reborrow any amounts prepaid under this Note.
Section 
  
Prepayment
provided, however,
4..  The unpaid principal balance of this Note (exclusive of any past due principal) shall bear interest at the rate per annum of the Prime Rate less one and one-half percent.  Accrued interest on the unpaid principal of this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year for actual days elapsed, but in no event shall such computation result in an amount of accrued interest that would exceed accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance during the same period at the Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Note is expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the holder exceed the Maximum Rate.  If, from any circumstances whatsoever, the holder shall ever receive as interest an amount that would exceed the Maximum Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance and not to the payment of interest, and if the principal amount of this Note is paid in full, any remaining excess shall be paid to Maker, and in such event, the holder shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the highest lawful rate permissible under applicable law.  All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Payee or the holder of this Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of the Maker to Payee or the holder of this Note shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full of the principal (including the period of any renewal or extension thereof) so that the interest on account of such indebtedness shall not exceed the Maximum Rate.  If at any time the Contract Rate is limited to the Maximum Rate, any subsequent reductions in the Contract Rate shall not reduce the rate of interest on this Note below the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest accrued equals the amount of interest that would have accrued if the Contract Rate had at all times been in effect.  In the event that, upon demand or acceleration of this Note or at final payment of this Note, the total amount of interest paid or accrued on this Note is less than the amount of interest that would have accrued if the Contract Rate had at all times been in effect with respect thereto, then at such time, to the extent permitted by law, in addition to the principal and any other amounts Maker owes to the holder of this Note, the Maker shall pay to the holder of this Note an amount equal to the difference between:  (i) the lesser of the amount of interest that would have accrued if the Contract Rate had at all times been in effect or the amount of interest that would have accrued if the Maximum Rate had at all times been in effect; and (ii) the amount of interest actually paid on this Note.
Section 
  
Interest
5..  Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the holder shall have all of the rights and remedies provided in the applicable Uniform Commercial Code, this Note, the Pledge Agreement or any other agreement of Maker and in favor of the holder, as well as those rights and remedies provided by any other applicable law, rule or regulation.  In conjunction with and in addition to the foregoing rights and remedies of the holder hereof, the holder hereof may declare all indebtedness due under this Note, although otherwise unmatured, to be due and payable immediately without notice or demand whatsoever. All rights and remedies of the holder are cumulative and may be exercised singly or concurrently.  The exercise of any right or remedy will not be a waiver of any other right or remedy.

The principal balance outstanding and all accrued or accruing interest owed under this Note as recorded by Payee in its records shall be the best evidence of the principal balance outstanding and all accrued or accruing interest owed under this Note; that the failure of Payee to so record or any error in so recording or computing any such amount owed shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Maker under this Note to repay the principal balance outstanding and all accrued or accruing interest.
Section 
  
Record of Outstanding Indebtedness

8..  Maker and each surety, endorser, guarantor, and other party now or subsequently liable for payment of this Note, severally waive demand, presentment for payment, notice of dishonor, protest, notice of protest, diligence in collecting or bringing suit against any party liable on this Note, and further agree to any and all extensions, renewals, modifications, partial payments, substitutions of evidence of indebtedness, and the taking or release of any collateral with or without notice before or after demand by the holder for payment under this Note.

In view of the fact that federal and state securities laws may impose certain restrictions on the method by which a sale of the Pledged Collateral may be effected after an Event of Default, Contran agrees that upon the occurrence or existence of any Event of Default, TIMET may, from time to time, attempt to sell all or any part of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to the this Agreement or by means of a private placement, restricting the prospective purchasers to those who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for investment only and not for distribution.  In so doing, TIMET may solicit offers to buy the Pledged Collateral, or any part of it, for cash, from a limited number of investors who might be interested in purchasing the Pledged Collateral, and if TIMET solicits such offers from not less than four (4) such investors that are not affiliated with TIMET, then the acceptance by TIMET of the highest offer obtained therefrom shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable method of disposition of the Pledged Collateral, and a sale pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonably disposition of the Pledged Collateral.
Section 12.
Remedies Upon Default
In addition, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of Contran to exercise the voting and other rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in TIMET as provided in and subject to the terms of Section 6(b) hereof.
  .  Contran will pay to TIMET the amount of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel (including allocated costs of inside counsel), of any investment banking firm, business broker or other selling agent and of any other experts and agents retained by TIMET, which TIMET may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this Agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Pledged Collateral, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of TIMET hereunder or (iv) the failure by Contran to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.  All amounts owing under this Section shall be payable upon demand.  Any and all amounts payable under or pursuant to this Agreement that are not paid when due shall bear interest (which shall be payable upon demand) at the Maximum Rate.
Section 13.
Expenses
  .  All rights of TIMET and security interests under this Agreement, and all obligations of Contran under this Agreement, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and unaffected by:
Section 14.

(a)
           All rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise provided by law or agreement between or among the parties.

(b)
 
           Any delay on the part of TIMET in exercising any of TIMETs rights, remedies, powers and privileges hereunder or any partial or single exercise thereof shall not constitute a waiver thereof.  None of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be changed, waived, modified or varied in any manner whatsoever unless in writing duly executed by Contran and TIMET.
(c)
           The rights and obligations of Contran and TIMET under this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.
