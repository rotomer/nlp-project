DALLAS, TEXAS . . . February 28, 2011 . . . Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET or the Company) (NYSE: TIE) reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $23.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to $4.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.  Net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $80.6 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $34.3 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2009.
The Companys net sales were $217.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $183.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, and net sales during 2010 were $857.2 million compared to $774.0 million during 2009.  The increase in net sales was principally the result of increased volumes, partially offset by lower average selling prices during 2010.  The Companys shipment volumes reflect robust demand for certain products within the commercial aerospace sector as manufacturing activity and inventory levels have increased throughout the supply chain in the fourth quarter and full year 2010.  Average selling prices decreased for both melted and mill products from 2009 to 2010, primarily driven by annual pricing adjustments under long-term customer agreements, lower spot market prices and the relative mix of products sold during the fourth quarter and the full year.
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $33.9 million compared to $9.3 million during the same period in 2009, and operating income for 2010 was $120.8 million compared to $54.9 million during 2009.  Lower cost raw materials, principally titanium sponge and scrap, and the benefit of higher utilization of production capacity each contributed to the improved profitability during the 2010 periods.
Bob OBrien, President and CEO, said, Demand for our products has consistently improved throughout 2010 as customers, particularly in the commercial aerospace supply chain, right sized their inventory levels and prepared for increased output in 2011 and beyond.  Our 2010 results reflect these improved industry conditions which we expect to continue through 2011.  Increases in our sales volumes for melted and mill products of 90% and 12%, respectively, together with our ongoing focus on cost control and manufacturing efficiency, contributed to the 120% increase in operating income for 2010.
The improvement in customer order trends that we experienced during 2010 has continued into 2011.  Our sales order backlog at the close of the year was 32% higher than a year ago.  The combined effects of announced increases in build rates for certain commercial aircraft, together with the continued ramp up of next generation aircraft, contribute to the increasing demand trends that we expect for the year ahead.  We believe that the rate of increase in demand is likely to continue, fueled by the combined effects of recovery in commercial and military aircraft sales, as well as anticipated growth in industrial markets.  Based on such factors, we currently expect our overall volume growth for 2011 to be comparable with 2010, with our production rates increasing accordingly.  We be lieve our financial strength, flexibility in raw material sourcing and production capabilities position us to take advantage of new opportunities to strengthen and expand our presence in key markets.
