Item 1.01.                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Merger Agreement
On November 9, 2012, Titanium Metals Corporation (the Company) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC), and ELIT Acquisition Sub Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PCC (Merger Sub), for the acquisition of the Company by PCC. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, PCC (through Merger Sub) has agreed to acquire all of the common stock of the Company for $16.50 per share in cash.  The total equity value of the transaction is approximately $2.9 billion.
 
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, PCC will commence by November 20, 2012 an all-cash tender offer (the Offer) to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Company for $16.50 per share, net to the tendering holder in cash.  Following the consummation of the Offer, PCC will acquire any Company shares that are not purchased in the tender offer in a second-step merger in which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of PCC (the Merger).  In the Merger, the remaining stockholders of the Company will be entitled to receive $16.50 per share of common stock.
 
The Merger Agreement includes a "go shop" provision whereby the special committee of the Company board of directors, with the assistance of its independent advisors, will actively solicit superior acquisition proposals from third parties for 45 days following the signing of the merger agreement. The Company does not intend to disclose developments with respect to this solicitation process unless and until the special committee has made a decision with respect to the alternative proposals, if any, it receives. No assurances can be given that the solicitation of superior proposals will result in an alternative transaction.
The obligation of the Merger Sub to complete the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including tender of the majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock not owned by the Companys principal stockholders, Contran Corporation (Contran) and its affiliates, who in the aggregate own approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock, the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and clearance by the European Commission pursuant to Council Regulation n139/2004.  The tender offer is expected to be completed in December 2012, subject to fulfillment of the conditions.  There can be no assurance that the Offer will be completed, or if completed, that it will be completed in December 2012.
 
 The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, PCC and Merger Sub.  The Company has agreed to covenants relating to the Companys conduct of its business between the date of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the second-step merger, restrictions on solicitations of proposals with respect to alternative transactions to acquire the Company, and certain restrictions on the Companys ability to respond to any such proposals, and other matters.  The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both the Company and PCC and provides that, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay PCC a termination fee of $45.5 million during the go-shop period and $101 million thereafter.
 
The Companys board of directors established a special committee consisting of independent members of the board which, with the assistance of their legal and financial advisors, evaluated, negotiated, and determined that the Merger Agreement and the tender offer were advisable, fair and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders (other than Contran and its affiliates). The Company board of directors approved the Merger Agreement, following the recommendation of the special committee.  The Merger Agreement has also been approved by the PCC Board of Directors.
 
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.  This summary of the principal terms of the Merger Agreement and the copy of the Merger Agreement has been included to provide security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, PCC, or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to security holders. Security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or PCC. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Companys or PCCs public disclosures.
 
Support Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Contran Corporation and certain of its affiliates (the Executing Stockholders)  have entered into a Support Agreement (the Support Agreement), effective as of November 9, 2012, with PCC and Merger Sub.  Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Executing Stockholders have agreed to, among other things, tender their shares of Company common stock in the tender offer and, if necessary, vote such shares in favor of the Merger and against any alternative acquisition proposal.  An aggregate of 79,224,055 shares of the Companys common stock are subject to the Support Agreement as of the date hereof, representing approximately 45% of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock.
 
A copy of the Support Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description of the Support Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Support Agreement.
