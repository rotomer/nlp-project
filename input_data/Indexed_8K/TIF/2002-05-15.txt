Item 5. Other Events. On May 14, 2002, Registrant issued the following press release reporting sales and earnings were up in the first quarter that ended April 30, 2002. NEW YORK, May 14, 2002 - Tiffany & Co. (NYSE-TIF) reported increased sales and earnings in the three months (first quarter) ended April 30, 2002. Higher retail sales in the U.S., as well as an increased gross margin resulting from favorable sales mix and product sourcing efficiencies, were the primary contributors to the earnings growth. Net sales of $347,129,000 in the first quarter were 3 percent higher than $336,401,000 in the prior year. On a constant exchange rate basis that excludes translation effects between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, net sales increased 6 percent and comparable store sales rose 1 percent. Net earnings in the first quarter increased 6 percent to $32,709,000, or 22 cents per diluted share, compared with $30,762,000, or 20 cents per diluted share, in the prior year. Results were consistent with the Company's guidance provided in a press release on April 25, 2002. In Tiffany's three channels of distribution: o U.S. Retail sales increased 4 percent to $165,670,000. Comparable store sales increased 2 percent, comprised of 2 percent comparable store sales growth in Tiffany's branch stores and a less-than-1 percent sales decline in Tiffany's New York flagship store. Sales growth benefited from increased numbers of transactions, but the average transaction size was lower. Sales to foreign tourists in certain markets also declined. New stores opened in the past year generated strong initial results. o International Retail sales rose 1 percent to $147,638,000. On a constant exchange rate basis, however, International Retail sales increased 8 percent. On that basis, comparable retail store sales declined 1 percent in Japan (total retail sales in Japan rose 7 percent), increased 5 percent in other Asia-Pacific markets and declined 5 percent in Europe. o Direct Marketing sales increased 9 percent to $33,821,000. Combined catalog/internet sales rose 37 percent and Business sales declined 11 percent. Michael J. Kowalski, president and chief executive officer, said, "We are certainly encouraged with the improved U.S. trends during the first quarter and are pleased with the 19% increase in earnings from operations. Tiffany's reputation continues to strengthen among a growing customer base that appreciates the extraordinary designs and quality of our product offerings. We will introduce new jewelry designs and timepieces later this year which we expect will further reinforce our reputation for excellence." He added, "Tiffany's internal initiatives are exciting and promising. However, the external environment remains unsettled with an uncertain near-term outlook. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to maintain our previous expectations that are based upon challenging U.S. and international conditions in the coming months followed by improvement - 1 -
in the second half of the year. As such, Tiffany's net earnings per diluted share expectations call for: 22-24 cents in the second quarter (compared with 24 cents in the prior year); 18-20 cents in the third quarter (compared with 16 cents); and 64-67 cents in the fourth quarter (compared with 55 cents)."
