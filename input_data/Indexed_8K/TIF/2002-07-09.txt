Item 5. Other Events. On July 9, 2002 Registrant issued the following press release providing a business update for its second quarter ending on July 31, 2002. NEW YORK, July 9, 2002 - Tiffany & Co. (NYSE-TIF) today provided a business update for its second quarter ending on July 31. The Company expects that its net sales in the second quarter will increase slightly over the prior year's $371 million. Combined with an increased gross margin, the Company now expects that net earnings will be at the low end of its previous expectation of 22-24 cents per diluted share, compared with 24 cents in the prior year. Security analysts' published estimates on First Call range from 22-26 cents with a consensus of 24 cents. Preparing to address investors at a conference in Boston, Michael J. Kowalski, president and chief executive officer, said, "Two months ago, we reported that Tiffany's first quarter sales rose 3 percent and earnings grew 6 percent. At that time, we felt the external environment was unsettled and said we expected challenging U.S. and international conditions to continue in the short-term. Therefore, we are not overly surprised that comparable stores sales for the first two months of the quarter are equal to the prior year in the U.S. and have declined 13 percent in local currency in Japan. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect to benefit from favorable economic conditions in the U.S. but we have moderated our sales growth expectations in Japan, although year-over-year comparisons will ease in both countries. Combined with lower than initially expected expense growth and some benefit from a stronger yen, we believe it is reasonable to maintain our earnings expectations for the second half of 2002. Therefore, we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of: 18-20 cents in the third quarter (compared with 16 cents in the prior year) and 64-67 cents in the fourth quarter (versus 55 cents)." The Company will report second quarter results on August 13 and will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. (EST) to review those results. Interested parties may listen to that call on the Internet at www.shareholder.com/tiffany, www.vcall.com or www.streetevents.com.
