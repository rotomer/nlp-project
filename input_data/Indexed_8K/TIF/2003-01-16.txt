Mr. Kowalski, commenting upon Mr. Chaney's achievements, said, "The fundamental strategic vision that Bill Chaney first articulated in 1983 continues to serve Tiffany remarkably well today. His emphasis on carefully controlled retail store expansion, his mandate to maintain a singular focus on Tiffany's core categories of jewelry, watches, and gifts, and his insistence on an uncompromising commitment to product and service excellence remain at the heart of Tiffany's extraordinary success. Most importantly, Bill Chaney established a corporate culture that has focused on creating long-term shareholder value while simultaneously honoring and enhancing Tiffany's 166-year legacy as one of America's great business institutions. Although we will miss his daily leadership greatly, we are confident his strategic vision will endure." In a statement Mr. Chaney said, "It is a great source of satisfaction and confidence for me and our Board that Mike Kowalski will now assume the role of Chairman of the Board along with his current responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer. During the past twenty years, Mike has served Tiffany & Co. with great success in a wide variety of responsibilities. During these past four years, he has lead the Company through a challenging period with great distinction. I cannot imagine a more capable or more qualified leader of Tiffany & Co. for the years ahead than Mike Kowalski." -2-
