International ("International") entered into an Extinguishment and Termination Agreement (the "Termination Agreement") with Aber Diamond Corporation (the "Issuer") to cancel and extinguish certain provisions of the Subscription Agreement, previously entered into on July 16, 1999 (the "Subscription Agreement"). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Issuer agreed to cancel and extinguish certain of its rights with respect to the sale by International of the 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock, no par value, of the Issuer, purchased by International pursuant to the Subscription Agreement (the "Shares"), to certain dealers (collectively, "Dealers") subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, described below. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Issuer agreed to cancel and extinguish certain of its rights with respect to the sale of the Shares upon payment by International to the Issuer of the sum of US$ 7 million (the "Extinguishment Fee"); provided, that: (i) such cancellation and extinguishment of certain of the Issuer's rights under the Subscription Agreement only shall be applicable to a sale of the Shares to or through the Dealers; (ii) the Dealers shall have entered into an agreement with the Issuer providing that (A) the Dealers promptly shall disclose in reasonable detail to the Issuer the identities of the persons who have agreed to purchase the Shares from the Dealers (the "Ultimate Purchasers") and (B) the Dealers shall not sell to any Ultimate Purchaser or group of Ultimate Purchasers under common control, more than 2,000,000 of the Shares without the Issuer's prior consent to be acknowledged in writing; and (iii) the Board of Directors of the Issuer shall have received the written resignation of James Fernandez as a director of the Issuer. On December 7, 2004, International entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., CIBC World Markets Inc., Scotia Capital Inc. and UBS Securities Canada Inc. and their respective affiliates (collectively, "Merrill Lynch"), pursuant to which Merrill Lynch shall acquire, subject to certain conditions described below, all of the Shares at a purchase price equal to CAN$42.00 per share (the "Stock Sale"). 2
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Merrill Lynch will offer the Shares for resale (i) in the United States to "accredited investors" (as defined in Section 2(a)(15) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")) and to "qualified institutional buyers" as defined in Rule 144A(a)(1) under the Securities Act, (ii) in all transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act ("Regulation S") and (iii) in Canada without filing a prospectus and in compliance with Canadian securities laws including the rules and regulations of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The obligations of Merrill Lynch under the Purchase Agreement are subject to termination in the absolute discretion of Merrill Lynch if at any time prior to the time of purchase there shall have occurred: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the Toronto Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the shares of common stock of the Issuer on the Toronto Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Canadian or Ontario authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in Canada; or (iv) any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in Canada or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) in the judgment of Merrill Lynch makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner set forth in the Purchase Agreement. This Current Report on Form 8-K is not an offer to sell any securities or a solicitation to buy any securities. These securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration thereunder or under an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.

Exhibit 99.1 TIFFANY & CO. NEWS RELEASE Fifth Avenue & 57th Street Contacts: New York, N.Y. 10022 James N. Fernandez (212) 230-5315 Mark L. Aaron (212) 230-5301 TIFFANY AND ABER DIAMOND CORPORATION MODIFY AGREEMENTS New York, N.Y., December 6, 2004 - Tiffany & Co. ("Tiffany") (NYSE - TIF) announced today that it and Aber Diamond Corporation ("Aber") (TSX - ABZ; NASDAQ - - ABER) have agreed to increase the price at which Tiffany purchases diamonds from Aber to market value and to eliminate certain restrictions on the sale of Aber shares held by Tiffany. Tiffany's holding in Aber consists of eight million shares, or 13.9% of Aber's outstanding common stock. The shares were acquired directly from Aber in 1999 through a Subscription Agreement. For consideration to be paid by Tiffany, Aber has agreed to modify the Subscription Agreement in order to eliminate certain restrictions on Tiffany's right to sell the Aber common stock that Tiffany holds. This modification also ended Tiffany's right to representation on Aber's Board of Directors; as a result, James N. Fernandez, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Tiffany, has resigned as a director of Aber. Aber holds a 40% stake in the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada's Northwest Territories. Aber and Tiffany remain parties to a Diamond Supply Agreement, whereby Tiffany is obligated to purchase at least $50 million in value per year of rough diamonds that meet its quality requirements. The Diamond Supply Agreement will expire in 2013. For consideration to be paid by Aber, Tiffany agreed to modify pricing provisions in the Diamond Supply Agreement so that Tiffany will no longer purchase at a discount. After offsetting Tiffany's payment obligation to Aber, Tiffany will receive a net payment of $5 million from Aber. 1
As a result of the payment to be made by Aber, the change in the pricing provisions under the Diamond Supply Agreement is not expected to have a significant effect on Tiffany's gross margins. The two companies will continue to enjoy a mutually profitable commercial relationship.
