Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Subsequent to the Company's February 28, 2005 press release announcing unaudited fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and annual results, certain expenses associated with the expensing of share-based compensation were reclassified within the consolidated statement of earnings. This reclassification, which resulted in expense related to share-based payment arrangements for personnel involved with the production, procurement and distribution of merchandise being reclassified from selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales, did not result in any change to previously announced earnings from operations or net earnings. Reclassified statements of earnings are included within the Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2005 incorporated by reference within the Company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2005.
