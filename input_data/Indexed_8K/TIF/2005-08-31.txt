Exhibit 99.1 TIFFANY & CO. NEWS RELEASE Fifth Avenue & 57th Street Contacts: New York, N.Y. 10022 --------- James N. Fernandez (212) 230-5315 Mark L. Aaron (212) 230-5301 TIFFANY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS -------------------------------------- New York, N.Y., August 31, 2005 - Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) reported that its net sales increased 11% in the second quarter. Comparable store sales rose 6% in the U.S. and 1% in local currency in Japan. Earnings from operations increased 27% due to the sales growth and its leverage effect on selling, general and administrative expenses. Net earnings in the three months (second quarter) ended July 31, 2005 increased 53% to $50,551,000, or $0.35 per diluted share, from $33,090,000, or $0.22 per diluted share. Net earnings in the six months (first half) ended July 31, 2005 rose 30% to $90,609,000, or $0.62 per diluted share, versus $69,901,000, or $0.47 per diluted share. As a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the effective tax rates in both periods were lower than the prior year, which boosted earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the second quarter and $0.06 per diluted share in the first half. Net sales in the second quarter increased 11% to $526,701,000, compared with $476,597,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes currency effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars, net sales increased 10% and worldwide comparable store sales increased 4% (see attached "Non-GAAP Measures"). In the first half, net sales rose 11% to $1,036,602,000, compared with $933,557,000 in the prior year. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, net sales rose 10% and worldwide comparable store sales rose 4%. Sales in Tiffany's channels of distribution were as follows: - ------------------------------------------------------------ o U.S. Retail sales increased 8% to $267,710,000 in the second quarter and 11% to $523,562,000 in the first half. Comparable store sales rose 6% in the second quarter due to growth of 6% in comparable branch store sales and 3% in New York flagship store sales. Comparable store sales increased 8% in the first half due to growth of 8% in branch store sales and 7% in the New York flagship store. The Company opened a store in Carmel, California in the second quarter and now operates 56 TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.S. 1
Effective in the second quarter, the Company placed responsibility for U.S. business gift sales within the U.S. Retail channel and, consequently, now reports U.S. business gift sales in that channel. In the past, such sales were reported in the Direct Marketing channel, which will continue to report business gift sales transacted by e-commerce. The prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. An attached schedule highlights the changes. o Direct Marketing sales increased 5% to $30,354,000 in the second quarter and 9% to $59,290,000 in the first half, primarily due to increases in the amounts spent per e-commerce and catalog order. o International Retail sales increased 12% to $202,104,000 in the second quarter and 7% to $392,420,000 in the first half. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, international retail sales rose 9% in the quarter and 5% in the half, including comparable store sales growth of 3% in the quarter and a decline of 2% in the half. On that basis, comparable store sales increased 1% in the quarter and declined 5% in the half in Japan (total retail sales rose 5% in the quarter and fractionally in the half); rose 6% in both periods in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan; and increased 5% and 2% in Europe. The Company added retail locations in Brisbane, Australia and in Paris, France (its third location) in the second quarter and operates 94 TIFFANY & CO. international stores and boutiques. o Other sales increased 43% to $26,533,000 in the second quarter and 52% to $61,330,000 in the first half. These increases were largely due to sales of rough diamonds (such sales commenced in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue on a regular basis as a component of the Company's direct diamond sourcing initiatives). Also contributing to growth were sales increases of 6% and 13% in the Company's LITTLE SWITZERLAND stores, and sales in the first two IRIDESSE stores which opened last fall and focus exclusively on the pearl jewelry category. Other Financial Highlights: - --------------------------- o Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) of 55.5% in the second quarter was equal to the prior year. Gross margin of 54.7% in the first half was lower than 56.1% in the prior year, largely due to changes in geographic/product sales mix and higher product costs, as well as wholesale sales of rough diamonds which earn a minimal or no gross margin. The Company recorded LIFO inventory charges of $2,952,000 in the second quarter and $4,169,000 in the first half, compared with charges of $5,453,000 and $9,027,000 in the prior year. 2
o Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in both the second quarter and first half were 6% higher than the prior-year periods. The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 41.4% in the second quarter and 41.1% in the first half, versus 43.3% and 43.1% in the prior year, due to the leverage effect of strong sales growth on fixed SG&A expenses. o The operating margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales) increased to 14.1% in the second quarter, versus 12.2% in the prior year, and rose to 13.6% in the first half, versus 13.0% a year ago. o Effective tax rates of 28.0% in the second quarter and 31.5% in the first half were lower than 38.0% in the prior-year periods. The decreases were due to additional tax benefits of $6,600,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the second quarter and $8,100,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the first half, which were related to the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. o Net inventories at July 31, 2005 were 3% higher than a year ago. Finished goods inventories rose 9% in support of broadened product offerings and new stores. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories declined 10%, reflecting a substantial buildup last year during the initial development of rough diamond sourcing activities. o The Company continues to repurchase its shares. In the second quarter, the Company repurchased and retired 1,538,520 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $49,970,000, or an average cost of $32.48 per share. In the first half, it repurchased and retired 2,575,312 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $83,948,000, or an average cost of $32.60 per share. Approximately $325 million remains available for future repurchases under the currently authorized plan. o The Company's financial position remains strong. At July 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents were $128,611,000 (versus $153,623,000 a year ago), total debt was $404,263,000 (versus $586,337,000 a year ago) and stockholders' equity was $1,693,975,000 (versus $1,507,608,000 a year ago). Total debt as a percentage of stockholders' equity was 24% at July 31, 2005, versus 39% a year ago. Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "These quarterly results are encouraging and we believe well-position Tiffany for a successful second half. Our full-year objectives call for an 8-10% increase in net sales, including U.S. comparable store sales growth in a mid-to-high single-digit range and Japan comparable store sales in local currency approximately equal to the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect a modest year-over-year decline in gross margin, a low-to-mid single-digit 3
percentage increase in SG&A expenses, approximately $20 million of other expenses, net and an effective tax rate of approximately 36%. Based on these reported actual results, we believe it is reasonable for us to increase our expectation for full year 2005 net earnings to a range of $1.55 - $1.65 per diluted share, from the previous range of $1.45 - $1.55. In addition, the Company is on track to achieve its objective for a mid-single-digit percentage increase in inventories for the full year, which should contribute to an improving return on assets."

NON-GAAP MEASURES - ----------------- The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). Internally, management monitors the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management uses this constant-exchange-rate measure because it believes it is a more representative assessment of the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company's operating results. The following table reconciles net sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis: 7
SEGMENT REPORTING RECLASSIFICATION - ---------------------------------- Effective with the current reporting period, the Company placed responsibility for U.S. business-to-business sales within the U.S. Retail channel and, consequently, now reports business-to-business sales in that channel. In the past, such sales were reported in the Direct Marketing channel, which will continue to report business-to-business Internet transactions. The prior year's amounts affected by the change have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation as follows: 8
