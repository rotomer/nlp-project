Exhibit 99.1 TIFFANY & CO. NEWS RELEASE Fifth Avenue & 57th Street Contacts: New York, N.Y. 10022 --------- James N. Fernandez (212) 230-5315 Mark L. Aaron (212) 230-5301 TIFFANY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS ------------------------------------- New York, N.Y., November 30, 2005 - Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) today reported increases of 8% in net sales and 37% in net earnings for its third quarter ended October 31, 2005. Earnings growth benefited from a 5% increase in worldwide comparable store sales, a higher gross margin and a lower effective tax rate. Net earnings in the three months (third quarter) ended October 31, 2005 rose 37% to $23,789,000, or $0.16 per diluted share, versus $17,358,000, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the prior year. For the nine-month period ended October 31, 2005, net earnings increased 31% to $114,398,000, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared with $87,259,000, or $0.59 per diluted share. Net sales in the third quarter increased 8% to $500,105,000, versus $461,152,000 in the prior year. Net sales for the nine-month period rose 10% to $1,536,707,000, compared with $1,394,709,000 a year ago. On a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes currency effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars, net sales increased 9% in the third quarter and 10% in the nine-month period, with worldwide comparable store sales increasing 5% and 4% (see attached Non-GAAP Measures). Sales in the Company's channels of distribution were as follows: - ---------------------------------------------------------------- o U.S. Retail sales increased 9% to $247,782,000 in the third quarter; comparable store sales rose 7% due to growth of 12% in New York flagship store sales and 6% in branch store sales. In the nine-month period, U.S. Retail sales rose 10% to $771,344,000; comparable store sales rose 8% with equivalent growth in both the New York store and branch stores. Tiffany opened a store in San Antonio, Texas in the quarter and operated 57 TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. o International Retail sales increased 7% to $204,287,000 in the third quarter and 7% to $596,707,000 in the nine-month period. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, 1
sales rose 7% in the third quarter and 6% in the nine-month period and comparable store sales increased 1% in the quarter and declined 1% in the nine-month period. On that same basis, comparable store sales in Japan in the quarter were equal to the prior year and declined 3% in the nine-month period; increased 4% and 5% in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan; and declined 1% and rose 1% in Europe. Total retail sales in Japan rose 5% in the third quarter and 2% in the nine-month period, which reflects the opening of two retail locations in the quarter (Yokohama and Osaka) and the closing of five older locations this year. The Company currently operates 95 TIFFANY & CO. international stores and boutiques. o Direct Marketing sales increased 4% to $27,308,000 in the third quarter and 7% to $86,598,000 in the nine-month period due to increased average amounts spent for Internet and catalog orders. o Other sales increased 22% to $20,728,000 in the third quarter and 43% to $82,058,000 in the nine-month period. More than half of the increase in both periods was due to wholesale sales of diamonds. In addition, sales increased 10% and 12% in the Company's LITTLE SWITZERLAND stores. The Company's IRIDESSE stores, which commenced operations in late-2004 and which focus exclusively on the pearl jewelry category, added to sales growth. Michael J. Kowalski, Tiffany's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We were pleased to see continued comparable store sales strength in the U.S. and progress in Japan. Tiffany's extraordinary product offerings, including new jewelry designs which complement our core designs, ensure that we are competitively well-positioned." Other Financial Highlights: - --------------------------- o Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) was 54.1% in the third quarter (versus 53.2% in the prior year) and 54.5% in the nine-month period (versus 55.1%). These results were due to a variety of factors, including changes in geographic/product sales mix and product costs, as well as wholesale sales of diamonds which earn a minimal or no gross margin. The Company recorded LIFO inventory charges of $4,178,000 in the third quarter and $8,347,000 in the nine months, compared with $8,682,000 and $17,708,000 in the prior year. o Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses rose 9% in the third quarter and 7% in the nine-month period. The Company recorded a charge of $4,316,000 (or $0.02 per diluted share after tax) in the third quarter as a result of 2
the sale of a glassware manufacturing facility and the sale of Tiffany's equity interest in a specialty retailer. The ratio of SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 46.1% in the third quarter (versus 46.0% a year ago) and 42.8% in the nine months (versus 44.1% a year ago), and reflect the underlying leverage effect of sales growth on fixed SG&A expenses. o Earnings from operations rose 19% in the third quarter and 17% in the nine-month period and, as a percentage of net sales, was 8.0% in the third quarter (versus 7.2% in the prior year) and 11.7% in the nine-month period (versus 11.0% in the prior year). o The effective tax rate was 33.0% in the third quarter and 31.8% in the nine-month period, versus 38.2% and 38.0% in the prior year. The decrease in the third quarter was due to favorable reserve adjustments relating to the expiration of certain statutory periods during the quarter. In addition, the lower rate in the nine-month period was due to tax benefits of $8,100,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. o Net inventories at October 31, 2005 were 2% lower than a year ago. Finished goods inventories declined 1%. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories declined 6% due to the timing in 2004 of internal jewelry manufacturing and rough diamond sourcing. o The Company repurchased and retired 790,997 shares of its Common Stock in the third quarter at an average cost of $38.42 per share, and repurchased and retired 3,366,309 shares of its Common Stock in the nine-month period at an average cost of $33.97 per share. Approximately $295 million remains available for future repurchases under the authorized plan. o The Company's strong balance sheet at October 31, 2005 included cash and cash equivalents of $111,586,000 (versus $129,776,000 at October 31, 2004) and stockholders' equity of $1,692,647,000 (versus $1,516,334,000). Total debt declined to $403,971,000 from $660,583,000, and, as a percentage of stockholders' equity, declined to 24% from 44% a year ago. Mr. Kowalski added, "Based on these results and our expectations for customer demand during the Holiday selling season, we are maintaining our previously-published expectations for full year 2005 net sales growth of 8-10% and net earnings in a range of $1.55-$1.65 per diluted share." 3

TIFFANY & CO. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) NON-GAAP MEASURES - ----------------- The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). Internally, management monitors the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management uses this constant-exchange-rate measure because it believes it is a more representative assessment of the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company's operating results. The following table reconciles net sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis: 7
