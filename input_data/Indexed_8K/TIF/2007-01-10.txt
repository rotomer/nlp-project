Exhibit 99.1 TIFFANY & CO. NEWS RELEASE Fifth Avenue & 57th Street Contacts: New York, N.Y. 10022 --------- James N. Fernandez (212)230-5315 Mark L. Aaron (212)230-5301 TIFFANY'S HOLIDAY SALES INCREASE 15% ------------------------------------ New York, N.Y., January 10, 2007 - Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) today reported geographically broad-based sales growth in its holiday period from November 1 - December 31, 2006. Net sales increased 15% to $818,087,000, due to strong growth in the U.S. and most international markets. On a constant-exchange-rate basis which excludes the effect of translating foreign-currency-denominated sales into U.S. dollars (see attached "Non-GAAP Measures" schedule), net sales rose 14% and worldwide comparable store sales increased 7%. These results are based on unaudited sales. Sales by channel of distribution were as follows: o U.S. Retail sales increased 12% to $432,430,000. Comparable store sales rose 8%, due to sales growth of 15% in Tiffany's New York flagship store and 7% in comparable branch stores, resulting from increases both in the number of transactions and in the average amount spent per transaction. Five new U.S. stores opened in 2006 also meaningfully contributed to sales growth. o International Retail sales increased 18% to $283,549,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales rose 14% and comparable store sales rose 6%. Strong sales growth was achieved in most international markets, which more than offset a comparable store sales decline in Japan. Detailed sales results by geographical region are noted on the attached "Non-GAAP Measures" schedule. o Direct Marketing sales rose 10% to $69,738,000, due to increases in both the number of orders and in the amounts spent per order. o Other sales rose 51% to $32,370,000. The increase was largely due to increased wholesale sales of diamonds, as well as increased specialty retail sales in IRIDESSE and LITTLE SWITZERLAND stores. 1
Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said "We are delighted to report such strong overall sales growth for the holiday season which exceeded our expectations. We saw healthy sales increases in many product categories ranging from diamonds to silver jewelry. Based on these results and no meaningful change in sales or margin trends in the rest of the fiscal year ending January 31st, our full year expectation calls for 11-12% growth in earnings before income taxes and net earnings in a range of $1.82 - $1.85 per diluted share." Mr. Kowalski added, "Based on the success of new stores and numerous opportunities, our plans for 2007 include accelerating the pace of TIFFANY & CO. store openings to 5-7 in the U.S. and 10 internationally. We will also introduce a wide range of new products. We are still engaged in our financial planning, but our preliminary expectation for 2007 calls for low-double-digit net sales growth and approximately 13-15% growth in earnings per diluted share. We will elaborate further when we report our full year 2006 results."

TIFFANY & CO. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) NON-GAAP MEASURES - ----------------- The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). Internally, management monitors the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate measure is a more representative assessment of the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company's operating results. The following tables reconcile sales percentage increases (decreases), versus the prior year, from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis: 3
