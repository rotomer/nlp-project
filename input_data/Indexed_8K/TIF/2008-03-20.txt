Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am pleased to announce these candidates for election as directors at Tiffany's 2008 annual meeting. We have an active and engaged board and management team who, together, have worked aggressively and diligently to identify and implement sustainable growth initiatives. We believe that Larry Fish and Peter May will add valuable insights as members of our board and we look forward to working with them." Mr. Kowalski added, "I would like to thank two current directors who will not be standing for re-election. First, William R. Chaney has decided to step down after serving on the Board for 28 years, including as chairman from 1984 - 2003. Bill deserves immense credit for establishing many of Tiffany's key long-term strategies that have generated substantial earnings growth and value for our stockholders. We are grateful for his wise and inspiring leadership over the years, and are pleased that he has agreed to serve as an advisor to the Board. Bill will now devote more time to his other interests and we wish him much happiness. Second, in order to increase the proportion of independent directors on our Board, James E. Quinn has agreed to not stand for re-election. Jim will continue as Tiffany & Co. president, leading our international retail operations." Tiffany's director nominees will be included in the Company's definitive proxy statement, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and mailed to all stockholders 1
