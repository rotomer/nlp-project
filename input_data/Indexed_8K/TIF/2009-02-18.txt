ARTICLE XIII Miscellaneous 13.1 Neither party will make any press release announcing the signing of this Agreement until the other party shall have had an opportunity to review and comment upon the 15
proposed press release. 13.2 Neither this Agreement, nor any part hereof, shall be construed to create in favor of Tiffany or Tiffany-Japan a lease or possession right or, except as expressly stated in this Agreement, any other rights, in the Boutiques located in Mitsukoshi. 13.3 This Agreement may not be modified, altered or amended except by an agreement in writing signed by both parties. 13.4 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither party may sell, delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, or any part hereof, without the consent of the other party. In the event that title to a store of Mitsukoshi in which a Boutique is located is transferred to, or person to operate such store of Mitsukoshi is changed to, an Affiliate of Mitsukoshi, the said Boutique shall benefit from, and be subject to, this Agreement as if the said Boutique continued to be operated in a store of Mitsukoshi, on condition that the said store of Mitsukoshi is continued to be operated under the Mitsukoshi brand; provided, however, that in such case Mitsukoshi shall perform its obligations under this Agreement by acquiring rights with respect to such Boutique which are necessary for performing its obligations under this Agreement from such Affiliate in a form of license, etc. or causing such Affiliate to perform such obligations. 13.5 The failure by any party, at any time or times, to require strict performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall not waive, affect or diminish any right thereafter to demand strict compliance and performance therewith. Any suspension or waiver (which must be in writing) by any party of a default under this Agreement by the other party shall not suspend, waive or affect any other default under this Agreement, whether the same is prior or subsequent thereto and whether the same or of a different type. 13.6 Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement; provided that if any provision which has been a material consideration to either party entering into this Agreement is so prohibited or invalid the party to which such provision was material may terminate this Agreement if the other party is unwilling or unable, after negotiation in good faith, to modify this Agreement to replace such material provision with a valid substitute provision which is reasonably acceptable. 13.7 Subject to the provisions of Section 13.4, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto. 16
13.8 This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan applicable to agreements executed, delivered and performed within Japan, without regard to Japan's conflict of laws rules, including all matters of construction, validity and performance. 13.9 Except as otherwise provided herein, any notice necessary or desirable hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been validly served, given or delivered (i) effective upon hand delivery to an officer of the recipient or (ii) effective two (2) days following posting by registered mail, with proper postage prepaid, and addressed to the party to be notified as follows: If to Tiffany-Japan, at: 3-1-31, Minami-Aoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-0062, Japan, Attn: President If to Mitsukoshi, at: 4-1, Nihombashi Muromachi 1-chome, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo 103-8001, Japan, Attn: General Manager of Merchandising Division 13.10 The Article titles contained in and throughout this Agreement are and shall be without substantial meaning or content of any kind whatsoever and are not a part of this Agreement. 13.11 The parties shall discuss and attempt to solve in good faith all disputes, controversies or differences that arise between them. All disputes, controversies, or differences which may arise between the parties, out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach hereof, which cannot be resolved by discussion between the parties shall be finally decided by court proceedings. The parties hereto agree that the Tokyo District Court sitting in Tokyo, Japan shall have jurisdiction over such proceedings. 13.12 Neither party shall be deemed to have breached this Agreement by reason of delay or failure in performance resulting from a cause beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of such party. Said causes shall include, but not be limited to: acts of God; acts of war; riot; epidemics, fires, floods or other disasters; acts of government; strikes or lockouts. In the event a casualty loss or other such event beyond its control renders it impossible or reasonably unlikely that Mitsukoshi will be able to operate one or more of the Boutiques for a period in excess of three (3) months, Tiffany-Japan shall have the right to effect a partial termination of this Agreement in respect of the affected Boutique(s) only and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the unaffected Boutiques. 13.13 This Agreement shall be entered into in duplicate in both English and Japanese; however, in the event that any conflict in meaning arises when the Japanese version of this Agreement is compared to the English version of this Agreement, it is hereby agreed that the Japanese version will supersede the English version, it being 17
acknowledged that this Agreement was negotiated in the Japanese language. 13.14 This is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It supersedes all prior agreements, memoranda, oral agreements or understandings between the parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to impose an exclusive relationship upon either party and both parties shall be free to deal with others in all respects unless expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement.
