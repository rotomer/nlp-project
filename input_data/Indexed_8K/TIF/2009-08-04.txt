Failure to Fund
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to the making of any Loans that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders portion of the Loans (other than Individual Currency Loans) to be made on such date the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection therewith. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover on demand from such Lender interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such applicable Borrower until the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect (or in the case of Alternate Currency Loans, at a rate equal to the all-in cost of funds of the Administrative Agent for the applicable Currency) on each such day as determined by the Administrative Agent.

(c)        
Late Payments

provided
that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 12:00 Noon (local time in the city in which such Applicable Payment Office is located) on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Business Day for the purpose of calculating interest on the applicable amounts payable.

32
 
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of, and accrued interest on, their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements or Swing Line Loans,
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to a Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this subsection shall apply). Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
(h)       
Payments in Euro
. A payment in Euros shall be deemed to have been made by the Administrative Agent on the date on which it is required to be made under this Agreement if the Administrative Agent has, on or before that date, taken all relevant steps to make that payment. With respect to the payment of any amount denominated in Euro, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any Borrower or any of the Lenders in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds in Euros to the account with the bank in the Participating Member State which the relevant Borrower or, as the case may be, any Lender shall have specified for such purpose. In this subsection (h), all relevant steps means all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Administrative Agent may from time to time determine to be applicable for the purpose of clearing or settling payments of Euros. Any amount payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders under this Agreement in the currency of a Participating Member State shall be paid in Euros.
(a)        
Revolving Loans

. In connection with each borrowing of Individual Currency Loans in the same Currency, each Lender having an Individual Currency Commitment in such Currency shall make available an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such Individual Currency Loans,
multiplied by
such Lenders pro rata portion thereof (pro rata among such Lenders in accordance with each such Lenders Individual Currency Commitment in such Currency).
(c)        
General
. The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender of its obligation to make Loans hereunder.

date that is one Business Day prior to the Maturity Date,
provided
that any Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date that is one Business Day prior to the Maturity Date).
(d)       
Participations
. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in each Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Core Currency Commitment Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Core Currency Commitment Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank in respect of each such Letter of Credit and not reimbursed by the Parent or the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant on the date due as provided in Section 2.9(e), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Parent or the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this subsection in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or the reduction or termination of the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever;
provided
that no Lender shall be obligated to make any payment to the Administrative Agent for any wrongful LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Issuing Bank.

Reimbursement
. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit in a Core Currency, the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in the Core Currency in which such Letter of Credit is denominated. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit in a Non-Core Currency, the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in Dollars in an amount equal to the Issuing Banks all-in cost of funds in Dollars to fund such draft as determined by the Issuing Bank (each a 
Dollar Reimbursement Amount
). In connection with each obligation of a Letter of Credit Applicant to pay a Dollar Reimbursement Amount under this Section 2.9(e), the Issuing Bank shall deliver to such Letter of Credit Applicant, the Parent and the Administrative Agent a written statement setting forth such Dollar Reimbursement Amount. The Issuing Banks determination of such Dollar Reimbursement Amount shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Letter of Credit Applicant shall reimburse each such LC Disbursement by paying to the Issuing Bank at its Applicable Payment Office an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 4:00 p.m. (local time in the city in which such Applicable Payment Office is located) on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Letter of Credit Applicant shall have received written notice (by hand delivery or telecopy) of such LC Disbursement prior to 12:00 noon (local time in the city in which such Applicable Payment Office is located) on such date, or if such written notice has not been received by such Letter of Credit Applicant prior to such time on such date, then not later than 4:00 p.m. (local time in the city in which such Applicable Payment Office is located) on the next succeeding Business Day,
provided
that (A) in addition to such written notice, the officers of the Administrative Agent primarily responsible for the administration of this Agreement shall, promptly after they receive notice that a draft in respect of such LC Disbursement has been presented to the Issuing Bank, use reasonable efforts to notify such Letter of Credit Applicant of such draft by telephone,
provided
, further, that the failure of such Letter of Credit Applicant to receive any such telephonic notice from the Administrative Agent or any officer thereof shall not in any manner affect such Letter of Credit Applicants obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement in accordance with the terms of this Section, and (B) if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000 (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof), the Parent may, subject to the conditions of
 
40
 
borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.3 that such payment be financed with a Revolving Loan or a Swing Line Loan in the applicable Currency (Dollars in the case of a Letter of Credit issued in a Non-Core Currency) in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the applicable Letter of Credit Applicants obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Loan or a Swing Line Loan, as applicable. If the Parent or the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant fails to make such payment under this subsection when due, the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof and the Administrative Agent shall then notify each applicable Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Parent or the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant in respect thereof and such Lender's Core Currency Commitment Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each applicable Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Core Currency Commitment Percentage of the payment then due from the Parent or such Letter of Credit Applicant, in the applicable Currency (Dollars in the case of a Letter of Credit issued in a Non-Core Currency) and in the same manner as provided in Section 2.3 with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.3 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Parent or such Letter of Credit Applicant pursuant to this subsection, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this subsection to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this subsection to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement(other than the funding of Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Parent or the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)        
Obligations Absolute
.The Parents and each Letter of Credit Applicants obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.9(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Parents or any Letter of Credit Applicants obligations hereunder. Neither any Credit Party nor any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Parent or a Letter of Credit Applicant to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Parent and each Borrower (including each Letter of Credit Applicant) to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by Parent or any Borrower (including each Letter of Credit Applicant) that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be
 
41
 
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(g)       
Disbursement Procedures
.The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Parent or any Letter of Credit Applicant of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h)       
Interim Interest
.If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Parent or the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Parent or the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Advances (or in the case of unreimbursed obligations in respect of a Letter of Credit denominated in a Core Currency other than Dollars, the all-in rate determined by Issuing Bank as its cost of funds in the applicable Core Currency
plus
the Applicable Margin for Core Currency Advances);
provided
that, if the Parent or such Letter of Credit Applicant fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.9(e), then Section 3.1(e) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this subsection shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.9(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Parent may direct that any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries which is not then a Borrower become a Borrower and a Permitted Borrower for certain specified Currencies by submitting a Borrower Addendum to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Subsidiary duly executed by the Parent and such Subsidiary and, if such Subsidiary is an organization organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, a supplement to the Guaranty duly executed by such Subsidiary, together with (a) a certificate, dated the date of such Borrower Addendum of the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of such Subsidiary (i) attaching a true and complete copy of the resolutions of its Board of Directors and of all documents evidencing other necessary corporate action (in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) taken by it to authorize such Borrower Addendum and, if applicable, such supplement to the Guaranty, the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) attaching a true and complete copy of its certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents and (iii) setting forth the incumbency of its officer or officers who may sign the Borrower Addendum and, if applicable, such supplement to the Guaranty, including therein a signature specimen of such officer or officers, (b) an opinion of counsel to such Subsidiary in all respects reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (c) a certificate of good standing (or equivalent) issued by the jurisdiction of its incorporation. If any such document is not in English, such document shall be accompanied by a certified English translation thereof. Upon receipt of a Borrower Addendum and the supporting
 
42
 
documentation referred to above, the Administrative Agent shall confirm such Borrower Addendum by signing a copy thereof and shall promptly deliver a copy thereof to the Parent and each Lender. Thereupon the Subsidiary which executed such Borrower Addendum shall become a Borrower hereunder and a Permitted Borrower hereunder for each such Currency specified in such Borrower Addendum and, if applicable, a Guarantor.
(a)        
Lenders Records

provided
that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, to make any notation on its records shall not affect the Parents or the respective Borrowers obligations in respect of the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the Loan Documents.
(d)       
Redenomination and Alternate Currencies
. Each obligation under this Agreement of a party to this Agreement which has been denominated in the National Currency Unit of a Subsequent Euro Participant state shall be redenominated into Euros in accordance with EMU Legislation immediately upon such Subsequent Euro Participant becoming a Participating Member State (but otherwise in accordance with EMU Legislation).

(iii)      if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lenders SL/LC Credit Exposure pursuant to this Section 2.12(c), the Parent shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders SL/LC Credit Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders SL/LC Credit Exposure is cash collateralized; or
(iv)      if the SL/LC Credit Exposure of a non-Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant this Section 2.12(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Core Currency Commitment Percentages;

(a)        Each Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each ABR Advance made to such Borrower from the date thereof until the conversion or maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such ABR Advance, at a rate per annum which shall be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin
plus
the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time.

plus
the Core Currency Rate for such Interest Period.
(c)        Each Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Individual Currency Loan made to such Borrower from the date thereof until the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Individual Currency Loan at a rate per annum which shall, during the Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin
plus
the Individual Currency Rate for such Interest Period.
(d)       Each Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Swing Line Negotiated Rate Advance made to such Borrower from the date thereof until the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Swing Line Negotiated Rate Advance at a rate per annum which shall, during the Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the Swing Line Negotiated Rate for such Interest Period.
(e)        Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each Loan shall, in each case, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2%
plus
the rate applicable to such Loan (or in the case of an Alternate Core Currency Swing Line Loan, an Individual Currency Loan, a Letter of Credit denominated in a Core Currency other than Dollars, 2%
plus
the Applicable Margin applicable to Core Currency Advances
plus
the all-in rate determined by the applicable Lender, Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, as its cost of funds in the applicable Currency), in each case until paid in full (whether before or after the entry of a judgment thereon). If all or any portion of
 
45
 
any LC Disbursements in respect of a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars or in a Non-Core Currency shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity thereof, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2%
plus
the Applicable Margin applicable to ABR Advances

(g)       The Administrative Agent shall determine the respective interest rate for each Interest Period applicable to a Core Currency Advance for which such determination is being made and shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Lenders thereof.
(h)       Interest on all Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed,
provided
that interest on ABR Advances, to the extent based on the BNYM Rate, interest on Core Currency Advances in Pounds Sterling and interest on Individual Currency Loans denominated in Hong Kong Dollars, Korean Won and New Taiwan Dollars shall be calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year (as the case may be). Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective.

The Borrowers acknowledge that to the extent interest payable on ABR Advances is based on the BNYM Rate, the BNYM Rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the BNYM Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrowers have not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make loans to other borrowers.
(i)        If the Reference Lender shall for any reason no longer be a Lender, it shall thereupon cease to be the Reference Lender. The Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, designate another Lender as the Reference Lender so that at all times there shall be a Reference Lender. The Reference Lender shall use its best efforts to furnish quotations of rates to the Administrative Agent on a timely basis as contemplated hereby.
(j)        In the event that any Credit Party shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that it shall have incurred Additional Costs or Associated Costs in connection with any Loans made by such Lender, the applicable Borrower agrees, within five Business Days of request by such Lender, to pay to such Lender the amount of such Additional Costs or Associated Costs.
 
46

charges
), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the 
maximum rate
) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all of the charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the maximum rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and the charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this subsection shall be cumulated, and the interest and the charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the maximum rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
(a)        Each applicable Borrower shall have the option to convert on any Business Day all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of ABR Advances (other than ABR Advances constituting Swing Line Loans) or Core Currency Advances into (i) in the case of an ABR Advance, one or more Core Currency Advances in Dollars, (ii) in the case of a Core Currency Advances in Dollars, one or more ABR Advances or one or more new Core Currency Advances in Dollars and (iii) in the case of a Core Currency Advance, one or more new Core Currency Advances of the same Core Currency,
provided
that (A) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4(b), Core Currency Advances may be converted into new Core Currency Advances or ABR Advances only on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the Core Currency Advances being converted, (B) the outstanding principal amount of the new Core Currency Advances having the same Interest Period shall be in an amount equal to $500,000 or such amount
plus
a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or an amount in the applicable Alternate Currency having a Dollar Equivalent of approximately $500,000 or such amount
plus
a whole multiple of approximately $100,000 in excess thereof), (C) the outstanding principal amount of the new ABR Advances shall be in an amount equal to $500,000 or such amount
plus
a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, (D) ABR Advances or Core Currency Advances in Dollars may not be converted into Core Currency Advances in Dollars if any Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and the Required Lenders shall have notified the Administrative Agent that such a conversion is not appropriate, and (E) no conversion pursuant to this Section shall result in a greater number of Core Currency Advances than is permitted under Section 2.2(d).
(b)       Each such conversion shall be effected by the applicable Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent, at its office set forth in Section 11.2, at least three Business Days prior written notice (each a 
Notice of Conversion
), specifying the ABR Advances or the Core Currency Advances to be so converted, the date of such conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and, if to be converted into Core Currency Advances, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of any such proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans.
(c)        If with respect to the expiration of an existing Interest Period for a Core Currency Advance the applicable Borrower has failed to deliver a Notice of Conversion with respect thereto, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected (i) if a Core Currency Advance in Dollars, to convert such Core Currency Advance to an ABR Advance and (ii) if a Core Currency Advance other than in Dollars, to convert such Core Currency Advance to a new Core Currency Advance with a one month Interest Period, in either case effective as of the expiration date of such existing Interest Period.

provided
that, if such Lender continues to have any Credit Exposure after its Core Currency Commitment and Individual Currency Commitments terminate, then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lenders Credit Exposure from and including the date on which such Lenders Core Currency Commitment and Individual Currency Commitments terminate to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Credit Exposure. Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, each date on which the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments or the Aggregate Individual Currency Commitments are permanently reduced and on the date on which the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments or the Aggregate Individual Currency Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date,
provided
that all unpaid Facility Fees shall be payable on the date on which the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments and the Aggregate Individual Currency Commitments terminate. All Facility Fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(b)       
Letter of Credit Fees
. The Parent agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, a participation fee (
Letter of Credit Fees
) with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin on the average daily amount of such Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lenders Core Currency Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Parent and the Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Banks standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Accrued Letter of Credit Fees and fronting fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.

(a)        In the event that any Credit Party with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) below or the Administrative Agent, the Reference Lender, or the applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, with respect to clauses (i) and (iv) below shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):
(i)        on the Business Day on which the applicable Core Currency Rate or Individual Currency Rate is determined with respect to any requested Core Currency Advance or Individual Currency Loan that, by reason of any changes arising after the Effective Date affecting the applicable interbank market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of the Core Currency Rate or the Individual Currency Rate, as the case may be; or
(ii)       at any time that such Credit Party has incurred increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan, any Letter of Credit or any participation therein, in each case by an amount such Credit Party deems to be material, because of any change since the Effective Date, in any treaty, law, rule, regulation, order or guideline applicable to such Credit Party or the compliance by such Credit Party with any request (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Effective Date or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new treaty, law, rule, regulation, order, guideline or request, such as, for example, but not limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payment to any Credit Party of the principal of or interest on such Fixed Rate Loan or any other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the Tax on Income of such Credit Party), or (B) a change in official reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve) or similar requirements, or in any special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Credit Party (or its Applicable Lending Office) (in each case, except to the extent included in Additional Costs, Associated Costs or the computation of the respective Core Currency Rate, Swing Line Negotiated Rate or Individual Currency Rate, as the case may be); or
(iii)      at any time that the making or continuance of any Fixed Rate Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law, rule, regulation or order or (y) impossible by compliance by any Credit Party in good faith with any governmental directive or request (whether or not having the force of law); or
(iv)      at any time that any Core Currency (other than Dollars) or any Non-Core Currency, as the case may be, is not available (x) in the case of any such Core Currency, in sufficient amounts in the applicable jurisdiction designated by each Credit Party in which such Core Currency is to made available by such Credit Party to the applicable Borrower, as determined in good faith by the Reference Lender, or (y) in the case of any such Non-Core Currency, in sufficient amounts in the applicable financial center designated by each applicable Credit Party in the jurisdiction in which such Non-Core Currency is to made available by such Credit Party to the applicable Borrower, as determined in good faith by such Credit Party, to fund any borrowing of Alternate Currency Loans in such Core Currency or such Non-Core Currency, as the case may be;
then, and in any such event, such Credit Party, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, or the Administrative Agent, the Reference Lender or the applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, in the case of clause (i) or (iv) above, shall promptly give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers) and, except for the Administrative Agent, to the Administrative
 
49
 
Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Credit Parties). Thereafter (w) in the case of clause (i) above, (A) in the event that Core Currency Advances or Individual Currency Loans are so affected, Core Currency Advances or Individual Currency Loans from such applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent, the Reference Lender or such applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, notifies the Parent and the Credit Parties that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent, the Reference Lender or such applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by any Borrower with respect to Core Currency Advances or Individual Currency Loans to be made by such applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by the applicable Borrower and (B) in the event that any Core Currency Advance or Individual Currency Loan is so affected, the interest rate for such Core Currency Advance or such Individual Currency Loan, as the case may be, shall be determined on the basis provided in the proviso to the definition of Core Currency Rate or Individual Currency Rate, as the case may be, (x) in the case of clause (ii) above, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Credit Party, within 3 days of written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Credit Party in its reasonable discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Credit Party for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Credit Party, showing the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to such applicable Borrower by such Credit Party in good faith shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto), (y) in the case of clause (iii) above, the applicable Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 3.4(b) and (z) in the case of clause (iv) above, Core Currency Advances in the affected Core Currency or Individual Currency Loans from the applicable Credit Party in the affected Non-Core Currency, as the case may be, shall no longer be available until such time as the Reference Lender or such applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, notifies the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers), the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties that the circumstances giving rise to the notice referred to above by the Reference Lender or such applicable Credit Party, as the case may be, to the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers) and the Administrative Agent no longer exists, and any Notice of Borrowing given by the affected Borrower with respect to such Core Currency Advances or such Individual Currency Loans, as the case may be, which have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by such affected Borrower. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Reference Lender and the Credit Parties agree that if it gives notice to any Borrower of any of the events described in clause (i), (iii) or (iv) above, it shall promptly notify the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers) and, in the case of any such Credit Party and the Reference Lender, the Administrative Agent, if such event ceases to exist. If any such event described in clause (iii) above with respect to Core Currency Advances or Individual Currency Loans ceases to exist as to a Credit Party, the obligations of such Credit Party, as the case may be, to make Core Currency Advances or Individual Currency Loans and to convert Core Currency Advances to new Core Currency Advances on the terms and conditions contained herein shall be reinstated.
(b)       At any time that any Fixed Rate Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 3.4(a)(ii) or (iii), the applicable Borrower may (and in the case of an affected Fixed Rate Loan by the circumstances described in Section 3.4(a)(iii) shall) either (x) if the affected Fixed Rate Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel the respective borrowing or conversion by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the same date that the Parent was notified by the affected Credit Party or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 3.4(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the affected Fixed Rate Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days written notice to the Administrative Agent and the affected Credit Party, (A) in the case of a Core Currency Advance in Dollars, require the affected Credit Party to convert such Core Currency Advance into an ABR Advance as of the end of the Interest Period then applicable to such Core Currency Advance or, if
 
50
 
earlier, as soon as practicable within the time required by law and (B) in the case of a Core Currency Advance other than in Dollars, Swing Line Negotiated Rate Advance or Individual Currency Loan, take such action as the affected Credit Party may reasonably request with a view to minimizing the obligations of such Borrower under Section 3.5.
(c)        If any Credit Party determines that after the Effective Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable treaty, law, rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or compliance by such Credit Party or any corporation controlling such Credit Party with any request (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the date hereof, will have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital required to be maintained by such Credit Party or any corporation controlling such Credit Party based on the existence of such Credit Partys Core Currency Commitment or Individual Currency Commitments hereunder or its obligations under the Loan Documents (including the obligation to make or participate in a Letter of Credit) to a level below that which such Credit Party or such corporation could have achieved but for such application or compliance (taking into account such Credit Partys or such corporations policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Credit Party to be material, then each of the Borrowers to the extent of its Proportionate Share and the Parent severally agrees to pay such to such Credit Party, within 3 Business Days of its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Credit Party or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Credit Party or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Credit Party or such other corporation as a result of such reduction. In determining such additional amounts, each Credit Party will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable,
provided
that such Credit Partys reasonable good faith determination of compensation owing under this Section 3.4(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Credit Party, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 3.4(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers), which notice shall show the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.
(d)       Each Credit Party shall notify the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers) of any event occurring after the Effective Date entitling such Credit Party to compensation under this Section 3.4 as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 120 days after the officer having primary responsibility for this Agreement obtains actual knowledge thereof,
provided
that no such notice shall be required if such Credit Party has determined not to seek compensation under this Section 3.4 as a result of such event. Each Credit Party will furnish to the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers) a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Credit Party for compensation under this Section 3.4. Determinations and allocations by any Credit Party for purposes of this Section 3.4 on its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to compensate such Credit Party under this Section 3.4 shall be prima facie evidence of such determinations and allocations.
(e)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Credit Party shall be entitled to any compensation described in this Section 3.4 unless, at the time it requests such compensation, it is the policy or general practice of such Credit Party to request compensation for comparable costs in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements for comparable customers unless specific facts or circumstances applicable to any Borrower or the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents would alter such policy or general practice,
provided
that nothing in this Section 3.4(e) shall preclude a Credit Party from waiving the collection of similar costs from one or more of its other customers.
 
51
 
(f)        If any Credit Party fails to give the notice described in Section 3.4(d) within 90 days after it obtains such actual knowledge of the event required to be described in such notice, such Credit Party shall, with respect to any compensation that would otherwise be owing to such Credit Party under this Section 3.4, only be entitled to payment for increased costs incurred from and after the date that such Credit Party does give such notice.
Each Borrower shall compensate each Lender, within 3 days of its written demand therefor (which demand shall set forth the basis for requesting such compensation), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities, including any loss, expense or liability (including those related to currency exchange) incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Fixed Rate Loans but excluding any loss of anticipated profit which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason, a borrowing of, or conversion from or into a Fixed Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion; (ii) if any repayment (including any repayment made pursuant to Section 2.8 or 3.8(b) or as a result of an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article 9) or conversion of any of such Borrowers Fixed Rate Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of such Borrowers Fixed Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by such Borrower; (iv) the assignment of any Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period or maturity date applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Parent pursuant to Section 3.8(a) or (v) as a consequence of (x) any other default by such Borrower to repay its Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (y) any election made pursuant to or event described in Section 2.7(c), 2.7(d), 3.4(b) or 3.9.
(a)        
Payments to Be Free and Clear
. All payments by each Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for, any Indemnified Tax. If any Loan Party or any other Person is required by any treaty, law, rule, regulation, order, directive or guideline to make any deduction or withholding (which deduction or withholding would constitute an Indemnified Tax) from any amount required to be paid by any Loan Party to or on behalf of any Indemnified Tax Person under any Loan Document (each a 
Required Payment
):
(i)        such Loan Party shall notify the Administrative Agent and such Indemnified Tax Person of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as such Loan Party becomes aware of it;
(ii)       such Loan Party shall pay such Indemnified Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is imposed on such Loan Party) for its own account or (if the liability is imposed on such Indemnified Tax Person) on behalf of and in the name of such Indemnified Tax Person;
(iii)      such Loan Party shall pay to such Indemnified Tax Person an additional amount such that such Indemnified Tax Person shall receive on the due date therefor an amount equal to the Required Payment had no such deduction or withholding been required; and
(iv)      such Loan Party shall, within 30 days after paying such Indemnified Tax, deliver to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Indemnified Tax Person satisfactory evidence of such payment to the relevant Governmental Authority.
 
52

Other Indemnified Taxes
. If an Indemnified Tax Person or any affiliate thereof is required by any treaty, law, rule, regulation, order, directive or guideline to pay any Indemnified Tax (excluding an Indemnified Tax which is subject to Section 3.6(a)) with respect to any sum paid or payable by any Loan Party to such Indemnified Tax Person under the Loan Documents:
(i)        such Indemnified Tax Person shall notify such Loan Party of any such payment of Indemnified Tax; and
(ii)       such Loan Party shall pay to such Indemnified Tax Person the amount of such Indemnified Tax within 5 days of such notice.

(d)       
Exception for Existing Taxes
. No amount shall be required to be paid to any Indemnified Tax Person under Section 3.6(a)(iii) or (b) with respect to an Indemnified Tax to the extent that such Indemnified Tax would have been required to have been paid under any treaty, law, rule, regulation, order, directive or guideline in effect on the Effective Date.
(e)        
U.S. Tax Certificates

Each Lender that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any political subdivision thereof shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Parent, on or prior to the Effective Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on the effective date of the Assignment and Assumption or master assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in accordance with Section 2.7(c) or 11.6 (in the case of each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Parent, any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), such certificates, documents or other evidence, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender (including, without limitation, Internal Revenue Service Form W8-BEN or Form W8-ECI) to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax under Section 1441, 1442 or 3406 of the Code or otherwise (or under any comparable provisions of any successor statute) with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. No Loan Party shall be required to pay any additional amount to any such Lender under Section 3.6(a)(iii) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the requirements of the immediately preceding sentence;
provided
that if such Lender shall have satisfied such requirements on the Effective Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on the effective date of the Assignment and Assumption or master assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), nothing in this subsection shall relieve any Loan Party of its obligation to pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 3.6(a)(iii) in the event that, as a result of any change in applicable law (including, without limitation, any change in the interpretation thereof), such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver certificates, documents or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to withholding as described in the immediately preceding sentence.
(f)        
Other Tax Certificates
. Each Indemnified Tax Person agrees to use reasonable efforts to deliver to any Loan Party, promptly upon any request therefor from time to time by such Loan

provided
that if such Indemnified Tax Person is or becomes unable by virtue of any applicable treaty, law or regulation, to establish such exemption or reduction, such Loan Party shall nonetheless remain obligated under Subsection 3.6(a) to pay the amounts described therein, and
provided
further, that no Indemnified Tax Person shall be required to take any action hereunder which, in the sole discretion of such Indemnified Tax Person, would cause such Indemnified Tax Person or any affiliate thereof to suffer a material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage.

(ii)       An 
Adverse Tax Position
 with respect to a Loan Party shall mean a position resulting from the lack of adequate capitalization or other similar condition with respect to such Loan Party which, under applicable treaty or law, results in higher Taxes on payments under the Loan Documents than would otherwise be imposed.

(C)       such Loan Party shall pay to such Indemnified Tax Person an additional amount such that such Indemnified Tax Person shall receive on the due date therefor an amount equal to the Required Payment had no such deduction or withholding been required with respect to such Excess Tax; and
(D)       such Loan Party shall, within 30 days after paying such Excess Tax, deliver to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Indemnified Tax Person satisfactory evidence of such payment to the relevant Governmental Authority.

provided
that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its Applicable Lending Office or Applicable Payment Office, as the case may be, suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.
(b)       Each Lender shall have the right at any time and from time to time to transfer any of its Loans to a different office,
provided

provided
that no such Lender shall be entitled to receive any greater amount under Section 3.4(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 3.4(c) or Section 3.6 as a result of a transfer of any such Loans to a different office of such Lender than it would be entitled to immediately prior thereto unless such claim would have arisen even if such transfer had not occurred.

provided
that such Lender shall remain responsible for all of its obligations hereunder and no additional taxes, costs or other burdens shall be imposed upon any Borrower or the Administrative Agent as a result thereof.

There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent and the Borrowers, threatened against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of, or otherwise seek to invalidate any Loan Document, or (b) which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document.

The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries with respect to all Federal, state, local, foreign and other taxes are considered by the management of the Parent and the Borrowers to be adequate, and neither the Parent nor any Borrower knows of any unpaid assessment which is or might be due and payable against it or any of its Subsidiaries or any Property of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except such thereof as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, and for which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance with GAAP.

Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or decision of any Governmental Authority which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is complying with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations of all Governmental Authorities, a violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed with all Governmental Authorities all reports, applications, documents, instruments and information required to be filed pursuant to all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requests which, if not so filed, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.

All leases of Property to each of the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, the Parent or such Subsidiary enjoys quiet and undisturbed possession under all leases of real property and neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default beyond any applicable grace period of any provision thereof, the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. No part of the proceeds of the Loans or any Letter of Credit will be used, directly or indirectly, for a purpose which violates the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable law, regulation or statute, including Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
No representation or warranty contained in any Loan Document and no certificate, Financial Statement, other financial statement or written notice furnished or to be furnished by the Parent
 
60
 
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, contains or will contain, as of its date, a misstatement of material fact, or omits or will omit to state, as of its date, a material fact required to be stated in order to make the statements therein contained not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor any Borrower makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any forecast or projection furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, except that such forecast or projection was prepared in good faith and based on assumptions which the Parent considered reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the preparation and delivery thereof.
(a)        Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Federal or state laws. Each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service or an application for such a letter is currently being processed by the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto and, to the best knowledge of the Parent, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or cause the loss of, such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Parent and each ERISA Affiliate have made all required contributions to each Plan subject to Section 430 of the Code within the statutory deadline, and no application for a funding waiver pursuant to Section 430 of the Code has been made with respect to any Plan except for those that could not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
(b)       (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur, (ii) no Plan has any Unfunded Pension Liability, (iii) neither the Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Plan (other than premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA), (iv) neither the Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur, any liability (and no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability) under Section 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer Plan, and (v) neither the Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA, in each case that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse effect.
(c)        All contributions required to be made with respect to each Foreign Pension Plan have been timely made. Each Foreign Pension Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable Governmental Authorities. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any obligation in connection with the termination of or withdrawal from any Foreign Pension Plan. The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign Pension Plan required to be funded, determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year on the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of which is reasonable, did not exceed the current value of the assets of such Foreign Pension Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities by an amount that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
The Parent has heretofore delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders copies of its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, containing the audited Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as of such date and the related Consolidated Statements of
 
61
 
Income, Stockholders Equity and Cash Flows for the fiscal year then ended (collectively, with the applicable related notes and schedules, the 
Financial Statements
). The Financial Statements fairly present the Consolidated financial condition and results of the operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein and have been prepared in conformity with GAAP as then in effect subject, in the case of interim Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability of any kind (whether fixed, accrued, contingent, unmatured or otherwise) which, in accordance with GAAP as then in effect, should have been disclosed in the Financial Statements and was not. Since January 31, 2009, there has been no Material Adverse change.
Each of the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries possesses or has the right to use all franchises, Intellectual Property, licenses and other rights as are material and necessary for the conduct of its business, and with respect to which it is in compliance, with no known conflict with the valid rights of others which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. No event has occurred which permits or, to the best knowledge of the Parent and the Borrowers, after notice or the lapse of time or both, or any other condition, could reasonably be expected to permit, the revocation or termination of any such franchise, Intellectual Property, license or other right which revocation or termination could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
There are no material controversies pending between the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective employees, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
Neither any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries (a) is a Person whose property or interest in property is blocked or currently subject to blocking pursuant to Section 1 of Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001 Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism (66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (2001)), (b) knowingly engages in any dealings or transactions prohibited by Section 2 of such executive order, or is otherwise knowingly associated with any such person in any manner violative of such Section 2, or (c) is currently a person on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons or is currently subject to the limitations or prohibitions under any other U.S. Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control regulation or executive order.

provided
that, subject to Article 8, nothing in this Section 7.1 shall prevent the abandonment or termination of the corporate, partnership or other existence or good standing of such Subsidiary (other than Tiffany, Tiffany International and Tiffany Japan) in any jurisdiction if (i), in the reasonable judgment of the Parent and such Subsidiary, such abandonment or termination is in the best interest of the Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not have a Material Adverse effect and (ii) such Subsidiary, at the time of such abandonment or termination, has no obligations, contingent or otherwise, under any Loan Documents to any Credit Party.

79
 
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).

(a)        No failure or delay by any Credit Party in exercising any right or power under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Credit Parties under the Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 11.1(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan and/or the issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Credit Party may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b)       Neither any Loan Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Parent, the other applicable Loan Parties and the Required Lenders or by the Parent, the other applicable Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders,

(ii)       reduce the principal amount of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation with respect to a LC Disbursement, or reduce the rate of any interest, or reduce any fees, payable under the Loan Documents, without the written consent of each Credit Party affected thereby (it being understood that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement or to the calculation of any financial covenant shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for the purposes of this clause (ii), notwithstanding the fact that such amendment or modification actually results in such a reduction),
(iii)      postpone the date of payment at stated maturity of any Loan or the date of payment of any reimbursement obligation with respect to an LC Disbursement,any interest or any fees payable under the Loan Documents, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the stated termination or expiration of the Aggregate Core Currency Commitments, any Individual Currency Commitment, the Swing Line Commitment or the Letter of Credit Commitment or reduce the amount of or postpone the date of any prepayment required by
Section 2.8(b)

(c)        To the extent that any Borrower or the Parent for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender under Section 11.3(a) or (b), or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent), the
 
83

Sections 3.4
3.5
,
3.6
and
11.3
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.
(c)        The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Parent and the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York, New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Core Currency Commitments and Individual Currency Commitment of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Parent and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Parent, the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)       Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Parent, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, the Parent, any Borrower or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Parent or any Borrower) (each, a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Core Currency Commitment, Individual Currency Commitments, SL/LC Credit Exposure and/or the Loans owing to it),
provided
that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Parent, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Credit Party shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso in Section 11.1(b) that directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Parent and each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.9as though it were a Lender,
provided
that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.9(h) as though it were a Lender.
(e)        A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections Section 3.4 or 3.6 than the Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Parents prior written consent. A Participant that is not a United States Person shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.6 unless the Parent (on behalf of the Borrowers) is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Parent and the Borrowers, to comply with Section 3.6(e) as though it were a Lender.
(f)        Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment
 
87
 
shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(a)        This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to any Credit Party, the syndication of the credit facilities established hereunder or concerning the documentation requirements for Non-Core Currency Loans constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Article 5, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by any electronic means that reproduces an image of the actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
(b)       The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each of the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Parent, a Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all obligations of the Parent, such Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Parent, such Borrower or such Loan Party may be
 
88
 
contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the Issuing Bank different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or the Issuing Bank or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank agrees to notify the Parent or the respective Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application,
provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
(a)        This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
(b)       The Parent and each other Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents against the Borrower, or any of its property, in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(c)        The Parent and each other Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any court referred to in Section 11.10(b). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
(d)       Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
 
89
 
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
(a)        Each Loan Partys obligations under the Loan Documents to make payments in the applicable Currency (the 
Obligation Currency
) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that, on the Business Day immediately following the date of such tender or recovery, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuing Bank or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase the Obligation Currency with such other currency. If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Loan Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the 
Judgment Currency
) an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction, the Obligation Currency could be purchased with the Judgment Currency as of the day immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the 
Judgment Currency Conversion Date

GUARANTY AGREEMENT, dated as of July 31, 2009, among the Persons party hereto set forth in Schedule I (the Current Guarantors), such other Persons which from time to time may become party hereto (the New Guarantors, and together with the Current Guarantors, the Guarantors and each a Guarantor) and THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, as administrative agent under the Credit Agreement referred to in the next paragraph acting on behalf of the Credit Parties.
Reference is made to the Credit Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2009, by and among TIFFANY & CO., a Delaware corporation (the Parent), TIFFANY AND COMPANY, a New York corporation (Tiffany), TIFFANY & CO. INTERNATIONAL, a Delaware corporation (Tiffany International), TIFFANY & CO. JAPAN INC., a Delaware corporation (Tiffany Japan) the other Borrowers party thereto, the Lenders from time to time party thereto and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Administrative Agent (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
The Lenders have agreed to make Loans to, and the Issuing Bank has agreed to issue Letters of Credit for the account of, the Borrowers pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement. Each Guarantor acknowledges that (i) it will derive substantial benefit from the making of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit and (ii) the execution and delivery by the Guarantors of this Guaranty Agreement is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, and the Credit Parties would not have entered into the Credit Agreement if the Guarantors had not executed and delivered this Guaranty Agreement.
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it and that it will remain bound upon its guaranty notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligations. For purposes hereof, Obligations shall mean all of the obligations and liabilities of the Parent and the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement (as the same may be amended, increased, modified, renewed or extended from time to time), in each case whether fixed, contingent, now existing or hereafter arising, created, assumed, incurred or acquired, and whether before or after the occurrence of any Event of Default under Sections 9(g) or 9(h) of the Credit Agreement (each an Insolvency Event), and including (a) any obligation or liability in respect of any breach of any representation or warranty, and (b) all post-petition interest, funding losses and make-whole premiums, whether or not allowed as a claim in any proceeding arising in connection with an Insolvency Event.
 
 
Each Guarantor further agrees that its guaranty hereunder constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to any of the security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in favor of the Borrowers or any other person.
Anything in this Guaranty Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder (other than the Parent; each such Guarantor, a Subsidiary Guarantor) shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greatest amount that would not render such Subsidiary Guarantors obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer, obligation or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any provisions of applicable state law (collectively, the Fraudulent Transfer Laws), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor (A) in respect of intercompany debt owed or owing to the Parent or Affiliates of the Parent to the extent that such debt would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder and (B) under any Guarantee of senior unsecured debt or Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Obligations, which Guarantee contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this clause (i), pursuant to which the liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to (I) applicable law or (II) any agreement providing for an equitable allocation among such Subsidiary Guarantor and other Affiliates of the Borrower of obligations arising under guarantees by such parties (including the agreements described in Section 1.4) and (ii) the Parent expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim that it may now or hereafter have against any other Loan Party, any other guarantor or any other Person directly or contingently liable for the Obligations, or against or with respect to the property of such other Loan Party, such other guarantor or such other Person, arising from the existence or performance hereof, and, in furtherance, and not in limitation, of the preceding waiver, the Parent agrees that, in the event that any money or property shall be transferred to any Credit Party by the Parent pursuant to this Guaranty Agreement in reduction of the Obligations, such transfer shall be deemed to be a contribution to the capital of the applicable Loan Party, other guarantor or other Person (in the case of the transfer of property, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property so transferred) as of the date of such transfer, and any such transfer shall not cause the Parent to be a creditor of such Loan Party.
 
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor (a Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor) agrees (subject to this subsection) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder (the Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor) or assets of such Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any Loan Document to satisfy a claim of any Credit Party hereunder, the Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor shall indemnify the Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as applicable, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Subsidiary Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Subsidiary Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Article 14, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Subsidiary Guarantor). Any Contributing Subsidiary Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to this subsection shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Subsidiary Guarantor under this subsection to the extent of such payment. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, all rights of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this subsection and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. No failure on the part of any Subsidiary Guarantor to make the payments required by this subsection (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to its obligations under this subsection, and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this subsection.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from, and protest to any Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guaranty and notice of protest for nonpayment. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor under the provisions of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Guaranty Agreement, any other Loan Document, any guaranty or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement or (iii) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
Each Guarantor authorizes the Administrative Agent and each other Credit Party to (i) take and hold security for the payment of the obligations under this Guaranty Agreement and the Obligationsand exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security, (ii) apply such security
 
 
and direct the order or manner of sale thereof in accordance with the Loan Documents and (iii) release or substitute any one or more endorsees, other Guarantors or other obligors.
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower or any other Loan Party, other than the final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Borrower or any Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any Borrower or any Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash. Pursuant to applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Borrower or any other Guarantor, as applicable, or any security.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Loan Party to pay, in the applicable Currency required by the Credit Agreement, any Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent in cash the
 
 
amount of such unpaid Obligations in the applicable Currency required by the Credit Agreement. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent, all rights of such Guarantor against the applicable Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. In addition, any debt of any Loan Party now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Guarantor on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such debt of such Loan Party, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.
Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Loan Partys financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Credit Party will have any duty to advise any of the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
Each of the Guarantors represents and warrants as to itself that all representations and warranties relating to it contained in the Credit Agreement are true and correct.
The guarantees made hereunder (i) shall terminate when all the Obligations have been finally and indefeasibly paid in full in cash, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend or otherwise extend credit under the Credit Agreement and all outstanding Letters of Credit shall have been cancelled and returned to the Issuing Bankand (ii) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as applicable, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Credit Party or any Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise.
Whenever in this Guaranty Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Guarantor that are contained in this Guaranty Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and assigns. This Guaranty Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and
 
 
a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment shall be void), except as expressly contemplated by this Guaranty Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If any of the equity interests in any Guarantor is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a transaction permitted by the Loan Documents and, immediately after giving effect thereto, such Guarantor shall no longer be a Subsidiary of the Parent, then the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement shall be automatically released. This Guaranty Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder.
No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent hereunder and of the other Credit Parties under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Guaranty Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 11.1, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Neither this Guaranty Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into by, between or among the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor or Guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 11.1 of the Credit Agreement.
All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 11.2 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to each Guarantor shall be given to it at its address set forth on Schedule I hereto.
 
 
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Guarantors herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Guaranty Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of any Loan Document, the making of any Loan and the issuance of any Letter of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by the Credit Parties or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect until this Guaranty Agreement shall terminate.
In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Guaranty Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
Upon execution and delivery after the date hereof by the Administrative Agent and a Person of an instrument in the form of Annex 1, such Person shall become a Guarantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor herein. The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not require the consent of any other Guarantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any New Guarantor as a party to this Guaranty Agreement.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Credit Party is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Credit Party to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any or all the obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty Agreement and the other Loan Documents held by such Credit Party, irrespective of whether or not such Credit Party shall have made any demand under this Guaranty Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Credit Party under this Article are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Credit Party may have.

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
Each party to this Guaranty Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Article 12. Nothing in this Guaranty Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Guaranty Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
 
 
HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

ANNEX 1 TO THE GUARANTY AGREEMENT
FORM OF SUPPLEMENT
SUPPLEMENT NO. __, dated as of _______________, to the GUARANTY AGREEMENT, dated as of July __, 2009, among the Guarantors party thereto and The Bank of New York Mellon, as administrative agent under the Credit Agreement referred to in the next paragraph (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Guaranty Agreement).
Reference is made to the Credit Agreement, dated as of July __, 2009, by and among TIFFANY & CO., a Delaware corporation (the Parent), TIFFANY AND COMPANY, a New York corporation (Tiffany), TIFFANY & CO. INTERNATIONAL, a Delaware corporation (Tiffany International), TIFFANY & CO. JAPAN INC., the other Borrowers party thereto, the Lenders from time to time party thereto and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Administrative Agent (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement and the Guaranty Agreement.
The Guarantors have entered into the Guaranty Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make Loans and the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit. Article 14 of the Guaranty Agreement provides that additional Persons may become Guarantors under the Guaranty Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement. The undersigned Person (the New Guarantor) is executing this Supplement in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement to become a Guarantor under the Guaranty Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make additional Loans and the Issuing Bank to issue additional Letters of Credit and as consideration for Loans previously made and Letters of Credit previously issued.
Accordingly, the Administrative Agent and the New Guarantor agree as follows:
Section 1.        In accordance with Article 14 of the Guaranty Agreement, the New Guarantor by its signature below becomes a Guarantor under the Guaranty Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Guarantor, and the New Guarantor hereby (a) agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Guaranty Agreement applicable to it as a Guarantor thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a Guarantor thereunder are true and correct on and as of the date hereof. Each reference to a Guarantor in the Guaranty Agreement shall be deemed to include the New Guarantor. The Guaranty Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Section 2.        The New Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties that this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally.
Section 3.        This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by each party hereto on a different counterpart), each of which shall constitute an original, but both of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one contract. This Supplement shall become effective when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts of this Supplement that, when taken together, bear the signatures of the New Guarantor and the Administrative Agent. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Supplement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Supplement.
Section 4.        Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Guaranty Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Section 5.        
THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
Section 6.        In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Supplement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Guaranty Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision hereof in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
Section 7.        All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Article 12 of the Guaranty Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to the New Guarantor shall be given to it at the address set forth under its signature below.
Section 8.        The New Guarantor agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this Supplement, including the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel for the Administrative Agent.
