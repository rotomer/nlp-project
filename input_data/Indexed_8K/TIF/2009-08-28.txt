TIFFANY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS;
EARNINGS OF $0.46 PER SHARE EXCEED EXPECTATIONS
 
New York, N.Y., August 28, 2009  Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended July 31, 2009. Sales and net earnings were below last year but exceeded expectations, and management increased its outlook for the full year accordingly.
 
Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, While economic and retail conditions remain challenging, we were encouraged to see many stores achieving either smaller year-over-year rates of sales declines or modest sales growth compared with the past two quarters. More importantly, Tiffanys strong financial and operating position allows us to continue to expand our global presence in pursuit of robust, long-term growth.
 
Net sales in the second quarter declined 16% to $612.5 million. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, which excludes the effect of translating foreign-currency-denominated sales into U.S. dollars, worldwide net sales declined 14% and comparable store sales declined 16% (see attached Non-GAAP Measures schedule).
 
Net sales in the six-month (first half) period ended July 31, 2009 declined 19% to $1,130.1 million. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, net sales and comparable store sales declined 16% and 18%.
 
In the second quarter, net earnings from continuing operations were $56.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with $82.6 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the prior year. Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share were $56.8 million and $0.46, versus $80.8 million and $0.63 in the prior year. Net earnings in 2009 include $0.07 per

diluted share of non-recurring income related to a loan recovery and tax reserve adjustments (see below).
 
In the first half, net earnings from continuing operations were $84.2 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared with last years $149.2 million, or $1.16 per diluted share. Net earnings and net earnings per diluted share were $81.1 million and $0.65, versus $145.2 million and $1.13 in the prior year.
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, financial results for the Iridesse subsidiary are classified as discontinued operations in the statement of earnings for the current and prior year periods.
 
Net sales by segment were as follows:

Mr. Kowalski added, We are pursuing a more modest pace of store expansion this year, in light of economic conditions, but will nevertheless increase the number of Company-operated stores by about 6%. Were enjoying successful launches of new products, highlighted by our KEYS jewelry collection. And weve improved our cost structure to maintain a healthy level of profitability and strong liquidity. Most important, we believe the current environment provides opportunity for significant gains in market share and we remain excited about Tiffanys long-term prospects.
 
2009 Outlook:
Sales trends in August are meeting managements expectation. For the full year (based on assumptions that may or may not prove valid), management now expects: (i) a worldwide sales decline of approximately 10%, including regional sales declines of: (a) a mid-teens percentage in the Americas, (b) a low-single-digit percentage in the Asia-Pacific region, (c) a low-single-digit percentage in Europe, as well as (d) a 50% decline in Other sales; (ii) a decline in the operating margin (when the prior year is adjusted to exclude one-time items) due to both a lower gross margin and the anticipated sales de-leverage effect on fixed costs, partly offset by savings tied to staff reductions and other cost-related initiatives; (iii) interest and other expenses, net of approximately $50 million; (iv) an effective income tax rate of approximately 34%; and (v) net earnings from continuing operations of $1.65 - $1.75 per diluted share (versus the previous forecast of $1.50 - $1.60 per diluted share).

NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar.   The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of the sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods.   The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:
