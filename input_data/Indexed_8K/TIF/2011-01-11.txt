TIFFANY RAISES FULL YEAR OUTLOOK
 BASED ON STRONG HOLIDAY SALES
New York, N.Y., January 11, 2011  Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) reported that its worldwide net sales in the two-month holiday period ended December 31, 2010 rose 11% over the prior year. Management has increased its earnings outlook for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2011 to reflect these higher-than-expected holiday period results.
Worldwide net sales increased 11% to $888.5 million in the holiday period. On a constant-exchange-rate basis which excludes the effect of translating foreign-currency-denominated sales into U.S. dollars, worldwide net sales and comparable store sales increased 10% and 8% (see attached Non-GAAP Measures schedule). Results are based on unaudited sales.
Net sales highlights by segment:

Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, We are very pleased with this worldwide sales growth, and with the increases we saw in every region in both months of the holiday period. Healthy sales growth was seen across most product categories, with particular strength in Tiffanys fine jewelry collections, diamond engagement rings and fashion gold jewelry, although with limited growth in silver jewelry sales.
He added, Based on these better-than-expected results, Tiffany is on track to achieve record sales and earnings (excluding nonrecurring items) in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2011. We now expect net sales of almost $3.1 billion and net earnings from continuing operations (excluding nonrecurring items) of $2.83 - $2.88 per diluted share, versus a previous forecast made in November of $2.72 - $2.77.

Information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in the Companys 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(Unaudited)
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Net Sales
The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar.
The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of the sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods.
The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:
