TIFFANY REPORTS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED SALES AND EARNINGS GROWTH IN ITS SECOND QUARTER
New York, N.Y., August 26, 2011  Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2011. Net sales rose 30% over the prior year due to strong growth in all geographic regions. Net earnings increased 33% and, excluding nonrecurring charges, rose 58% in the quarter (see attached Non-GAAP Measures schedule). Net earnings were $0.69 per diluted share in the quarter and, excluding nonrecurring charges, were $0.86 per diluted share. Management increased its earnings forecast for fiscal 2011 to reflect the better-than-expected second quarter results.
Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, We are extremely pleased by these results which confirm the growing global appeal of Tiffany's product offerings. In addition, we have been able to absorb precious metal and gemstone cost increases while improving our gross and operating margins."

Mr. Kowalski said, Despite continuing economic uncertainty, our strong first half performance gives us ample reason to remain confident about our prospects for the balance of the year. We are encouraged that total worldwide sales growth in the third quarter-to-date is continuing to exceed our expectations due to noteworthy strength in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Japan, demonstrating, once again, the attraction of the TIFFANY & CO. brand. We are increasing our full year earnings forecast to $3.65 - $3.75 per diluted share (not including nonrecurring expenses) from the previous forecast of $3.45 - $3.55 per diluted share due to the better-than-expected second quarter results.
Outlook for 2011:

TIFFANY & CO. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Unaudited)
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Net Sales
The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar.
The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods.
The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:

Net Earnings
The accompanying press release presents net earnings and highlights current year and prior year nonrecurring items in the text. Management believes excluding such items presents the Companys second quarter and year-to-date results on a more comparable basis to the corresponding period in the prior year, thereby providing investors with an additional perspective to analyze the results of operations of the Company at July 31, 2011. The following table reconciles GAAP net earnings and net earnings per diluted share (EPS) to the non-GAAP net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, as adjusted:
