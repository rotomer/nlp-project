TIFFANY REPORTS HOLIDAY SALES RESULTS
New York, N.Y., January 10, 2012  Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) today announced that its worldwide net sales in the two months ended December 31 increased 7% over the prior year, and that management has updated its full year earnings forecast accordingly.
st
Worldwide net sales rose 7% to $952 million in the holiday period, the result of double-digit sales growth in Asia-Pacific and Japan and smaller increases in the Americas and Europe. On a constant-exchange-rate basis excluding the effect of translating foreign-currency-denominated sales into U.S. dollars, worldwide net sales rose 6% and comparable store sales increased 4% (see Non-GAAP Measures schedule).
Net sales highlights by segment:

Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said After achieving very strong and better-than-expected sales and earnings growth in the first three quarters of 2011, sales weakened markedly in the United States and Europe during the holiday season, reflecting restrained spending by consumers for fine jewelry. We are now estimating that earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2012 will increase 23% - 25% to a range of $3.60 - $3.65. This estimate compares with a prior forecast made in November of $3.70 - $3.80 per diluted share and our initial fiscal 2011 outlook provided last March of $3.35 - $3.45 per diluted share. All estimates do not include $0.20 per diluted share of nonrecurring expenses.
He added, We are in the preliminary stages of financial planning for 2012 and will provide more detailed guidance when we report our full year financial results in March. We remain confident of our ability to expand our worldwide presence, to serve the growing global demand for TIFFANY & CO. products and to achieve a solid rate of annual growth in sales and earnings in 2012 despite economic challenges.
Next Scheduled Announcement:
The Company expects to report its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ending January 31, 2012 on Tuesday March 20, 2012. To be notified of future announcements, please register at (E-Mail Alerts).

TIFFANY & CO. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Unaudited)
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Net Sales
The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar.
The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of the sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods.
The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:
