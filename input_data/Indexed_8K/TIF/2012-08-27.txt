TIFFANYS SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS
IN LINE WITH COMPANY EXPECTATIONS
 
New York, N.Y., August 27, 2012  Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) today reported that in its second quarter the Company earned $92 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, on worldwide net sales of $887 million. Results were in-line with managements expectations.
In the three months (second quarter) ended July 31, 2012:
In the six months (first half) ended July 31, 2012:

Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, These second quarter results met the expectations contained in our previously-reported financial guidance. Not surprisingly, sales growth has been affected by economic weakness in a number of markets and by a very challenging prior-year comparison to a 30% increase in worldwide net sales. We also anticipated the reduced operating margin in the quarter, adjusted for nonrecurring items, due to continued, but moderating, high product input costs and a lack of sales leverage on fixed costs. The resulting decline in net earnings, when compared with last years earnings excluding nonrecurring costs, was in line with our expectations and was on top of a 58% increase in last years second quarter.
 
 
Net sales highlights were as follows:

Mr. Kowalski added, We think it is only prudent to maintain a cautious near-term outlook about global economic conditions and the effects on customer spending, with year-over-year growth comparisons in the next few months also being pressured by the strong increases we experienced last year. At the same time, we are determined to further strengthen Tiffanys competitive position by expanding our store and customer base and introducing enticing new designs, all intended to generate solid long-term financial performance.
Outlook for 2012:
For the full year ending January 31, 2013, management expects net earnings of $454-$473 million, or $3.55-$3.70 per diluted share, compared with the previous forecast of $3.70-$3.80 per diluted share. Management continues to expect an earnings decline in the third quarter followed by a resumption of growth in the fourth quarter. This expectation is based on the following assumptions (which are approximate and may or may not prove valid):

NON-GAAP MEASURES
Net Sales
The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar.
The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods.
The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:

Net Earnings
The accompanying press release presents net earnings and highlights prior year nonrecurring items in the text. Management believes excluding such items presents the Companys second quarter and first half results on a more comparable basis to the corresponding period in the prior year, thereby providing investors with an additional perspective to analyze the results of operations of the Company at July 31, 2012. The following table reconciles GAAP net earnings and net earnings per diluted share (EPS) to non-GAAP net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, as adjusted:
