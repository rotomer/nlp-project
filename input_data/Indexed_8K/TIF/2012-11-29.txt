New York, N.Y., November 29, 2012  Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) today reported that in its third quarter worldwide net sales were $853 million and net earnings were $63 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. Management updated its full year financial outlook.
In the three months (third quarter) ended October 31, 2012:
In the nine months (year-to-date) ended October 31, 2012:
Michael J. Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, Three months ago, we had anticipated that third quarter results would be affected by continued economic weakness in many markets as well as by challenging comparisons to last year when net sales were up 21% and net

earnings had increased 52% excluding nonrecurring items. However, gross margin was weaker than we expected and Tiffanys effective tax rate was higher than we expected. As a result, net earnings were below our expectations.
 
 
Net sales highlights were as follows:

Mr. Kowalski added, We continue to maintain a cautious near-term outlook about global economic conditions. However, we expect to see improving results in this holiday season, partly benefiting from easing year-over-year sales comparisons, but also tied to the success of new TIFFANY & CO. stores weve added this year, new product introductions and more product-focused marketing communications.
Outlook for 2012:
For the year ending January 31, 2013, management expects net earnings of $409-$435 million, or $3.20-$3.40 per diluted share, compared with the previous forecast of $3.55-$3.70 per diluted share. This forecast is based on the following assumptions (which are approximate and may or may not prove valid):

NON-GAAP MEASURES
Net Sales
The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar.
The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars (constant-exchange-rate basis). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods.
The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:

Net Earnings
The accompanying press release presents net earnings and highlights prior year nonrecurring items in the text. Management believes excluding such items presents the Companys year-to-date results on a more comparable basis to the corresponding period in the prior year, thereby providing investors with an additional perspective to analyze the results of operations of the Company at October 31, 2012. The following table reconciles GAAP net earnings and net earnings per diluted share (EPS) to non-GAAP net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, as adjusted:
 
 
 
           On a pre-tax basis includes charges of $213,000 within cost of sales and $42,506,000 within selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2011 associated with Tiffanys consolidation of its New York headquarters staff within one location.
