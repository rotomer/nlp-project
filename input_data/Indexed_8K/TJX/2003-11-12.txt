Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports 29% Increase in Fiscal 2004 Third Quarter EPS FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 11, 2003--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 25, 2003. Net sales for the third quarter were $3.4 billion, an 11% increase over last year, with consolidated comparable store sales up 3%. Net income was $183 million and diluted earnings per share were $.36, a 29% increase over last year's results, which reflected an after-tax charge of approximately $10 million, or $.02 per share, for claims related to four California lawsuits. Without this prior year charge, third quarter diluted earnings per share increased 20% over last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, net sales reached $9.2 billion, 9% over $8.5 billion last year. Year-to-date consolidated comparable store sales increased 1%. Net income was $420 million, and diluted earnings per share were $.81, a 4% increase over last year. Edmond English, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. commented, "We are very pleased with our 29% increase in third quarter earnings per share, which represents the high end of our expected range. With this year's more seasonable fall weather patterns, our third quarter shaped up much like we had expected. Margins at The Marmaxx Group were very strong in the quarter. Our younger divisions, HomeGoods, T.K. Maxx and A.J. Wright, delivered excellent bottom-line performance, as these organizations continue to roll out their concepts. "At The Marmaxx Group, the combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, third quarter sales increased 5% and comparable store sales were flat to last year. Segment profit increased by 21% to $265 million, which was at the upper end of our expected range and segment profit margin exceeded plan. Although comp sales at The Marmaxx Group were slightly below our expectations, our new stores continue to perform extremely well, and overall sales were within our planned range. Our results benefited from this year's normal fall weather patterns, compared with unusually warm weather during September last year. We are particularly pleased with the strength of our merchandise margins, which was attributable in part to our continued ability to buy the right product at the right price and offer compelling values to our customers. Also, Marmaxx's segment profit improvement reflected last year's charge related to the above mentioned lawsuits. Inventories are in great shape and we are well positioned to keep a constant flow of gift-oriented merchandise at compelling values, moving through our stores right up until the holidays." English continued, "At our Canadian divisions, Winners and HomeSense, total sales increased 35% in the third quarter. Comparable store sales increased 23% in U.S. dollars, due largely to the favorable currency exchange rates. In local currency, Canadian comparable store sales increased 6%. Segment profit increased 24% over last year largely due to favorable currency exchange rates. Winners also benefited from seasonable, fall-like weather patterns during the third quarter, compared with unusually warm temperatures last year. Winners did a great job of managing inventories while continuing to expand Winners and HomeSense in Canada. "HomeGoods had a strong quarter. Strong new store performance led to overall sales nearly reaching our goals, increasing 24%. HomeGoods' comparable store sales were up 2% in the third quarter. While comp store sales were below expectations, segment profit increased 42%, which exceeded our goals. This is largely due to this division's solid execution of its merchandising and inventory management strategies. "T.K. Maxx, in the U.K. and Ireland, had a very strong third quarter, increasing total sales by 31% and posting a comparable store sales increase of 13% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, T.K. Maxx's third quarter comparable store sales increased 8% over last year, which was ahead of our expectations. With segment profit increasing by 43%, we are pleased with how T.K. Maxx is managing its business and continuing to grow in the U.K. and Ireland." English continued, "A.J. Wright achieved another quarter of above-plan results. This young division posted a total sales increase of 56% and an above-plan comparable store sales gain of 14%. A.J. Wright's bottom-line performance outpaced our objectives and improved substantially over the prior year. "During the third quarter, we continued with our aggressive share repurchase program, spending a total of $125 million and retiring 6.2 million shares of TJX stock. Over the last nine months, we have spent a total of $390 million to repurchase TJX stock and have retired a total of 21.2 million shares." English concluded, "We are enthusiastic about the fourth quarter, which, like the third quarter, presents many opportunities for significant year-over-year earnings per share growth. As in the third quarter, we are anticipating a substantial improvement in margins at Marmaxx. Also, we expect Winners, HomeGoods, T.K. Maxx and A.J. Wright to continue delivering strong performance. In addition, we have a 53rd week in our calendar this year, which we expect will benefit our results by $.04 per share. Our new stores across all divisions continue to perform extremely well and we remain on track to grow our square footage by 10% this year. Our inventories are in excellent shape and we continue to capitalize on great merchandise opportunities to offer our customers a constant flow of great values on exciting gift assortments throughout the holiday selling season."
