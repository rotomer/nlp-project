Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports 50% Increase in First Quarter EPS For Fiscal 2005 FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 18, 2004--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced strong sales and earnings results for the first quarter ended May 1, 2004. Diluted earnings per share increased 50% to $.33 in the first quarter, over $.22 per share in the prior year. Net income was $168 million, a 48% increase over the $114 million earned last year. Net sales for the first quarter were $3.4 billion, a 20% increase over last year, and consolidated comparable store sales increased 8% over the prior year. Edmond English, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., commented, "We are extremely pleased with our strong first quarter performance, as we achieved top- and bottom-line results that were even greater than the significant year-over-year increases we had planned. We saw great customer response to fresh, spring women's apparel, and continued benefit from our strategy of buying close to need, which helped drive strong comparable store sales and merchandise margins. This, along with disciplined expense management, led to significant bottom-line margin expansion. As we enter the second quarter, our inventories are in great shape, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of the numerous in-season buying opportunities in the marketplace. "At The Marmaxx Group, the combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, we planned for substantial increases in the first quarter over weaker results last year, when the weather in many areas of the U.S. was unusually harsh. We are very pleased that this division significantly exceeded these expectations. Segment profit increased 40% to $272 million, well above our plan, and segment profit margin reached 11.2%, also well ahead of expectations. Total sales for the first quarter reached $2.4 billion, and comparable store sales increased 6%. Our strong results were primarily due to Marmaxx's successful execution of its inventory and merchandising strategies. Additionally, although still early, we are encouraged by the enthusiastic customer response to our footwear, accessories and jewelry department expansions." English continued, "At HomeGoods, sales increased 28% and comparable store sales increased 4%. Segment profit increased 14% above last year to $5 million. HomeGoods' first quarter results were impacted by a weak comp store sales performance in April, which was driven by our lighter-than-optimal summer, seasonal inventories, which were in high demand. That said, despite the shortfall in sales, we are pleased with HomeGoods' first quarter growth and continue to be very excited about this unique concept, which offers great values on a rapidly changing assortment of home fashions. "We are also pleased that sales for our Canadian divisions, Winners and HomeSense, increased 34% above last year and comparable store sales increased 18% in U.S. dollars, including the benefit of the currency exchange rate. Comparable store sales increased 6% over the prior year in local currency, which we believe more closely reflects our operating performance. Winners' segment profit increased 107% to $24 million, well ahead of our expectations. These strong results were primarily due to this division's solid execution of its merchandising strategy and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. In addition, we are pleased that our HomeSense concept continues to take hold in Canada, as this young division expands its business. "At T.K. Maxx, in the U.K. and Ireland, sales increased 49% and comparable store sales increased 21% in U.S. dollars, reflecting the favorable effect of the currency exchange rate. In local currency, T.K. Maxx's comparable store sales increased 5% over a strong 8% increase the prior year, when weather patterns were extremely favorable. Segment profit increased to $2 million, reflecting the favorable impact of the currency exchange rate. We remain very pleased with the growth of our T.K. Maxx concept, as this division continues to expand in the U.K. and Ireland." English continued, "A.J. Wright posted a 34% increase in sales in the first quarter and a comparable store sales gain of 9%. Bottom-line results for this young division were just shy of our expectations. During the quarter, A.J. Wright opened its 100th store, reaching that mark faster than any other division in TJX history. We are excited about the growth potential for this concept, as it continues to resonate with moderate-income shoppers, which represent a huge customer demographic. "Bob's Stores' first quarter results were in line with our expectations. This business, which we acquired in December 2003, has made significant improvements in its inventory management and flow practices, resulting in a fresher merchandise assortment in our stores. Our plan is to grow this business slowly and deliberately at first, as we refine the concept. Over the long term, we are excited by what we see as our opportunity to expand this value-oriented, branded apparel concept to 400 stores in the U.S. "We continue to generate significant returns on investment, which gives us the ability to grow our store base and the infrastructure to support it, while simultaneously pursuing our sizable share repurchase program and maintaining our strong financial position. During the first quarter, we spent a total of $137 million, retiring 5.6 million shares of TJX stock." English concluded, "We had planned to achieve significant increases in the first quarter, and I am delighted that we delivered results above our expectations. Following our very strong beginning to the year, we enter the second quarter with inventories in terrific shape, ready to capitalize upon the abundance of buying opportunities in the marketplace and continue to offer our customers great fashion at exciting values."
