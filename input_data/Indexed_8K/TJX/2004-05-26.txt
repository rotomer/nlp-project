Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Completes $1 Billion Share Repurchase Program; Announces New $1 Billion Program FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 24, 2004--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a new multi-year program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock. At current prices, this would represent approximately 8.3% of the Company's outstanding common shares. The Company also announced the completion of a $1 billion stock repurchase program, originally authorized in July 2002, which resulted in the purchase of 50.5 million shares of its common stock. This marks the fifth share repurchase program completed by the Company since 1997, over which time the Company has spent $3.25 billion on the repurchase of TJX stock. Edmond English, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. commented, "This authorization to continue our aggressive share repurchase program reflects our confidence in the strength of our business and its future growth. We continue to have substantial growth opportunities in our younger concepts as well as our more established business units. Our strong operations continue to achieve excellent returns on investment, which allow us to fully fund our Company's growth while generating significant excess cash to pursue our buyback program. Repurchasing TJX stock produces solid returns on our capital and allows us to provide significant value to our shareholders." Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit. The TJX Companies, Inc. is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. The Company operates 753 T.J. Maxx, 679 Marshalls, 185 HomeGoods, and 102 A.J.
