Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2004--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004. Net sales for the second quarter were $3.4 billion, a 12% increase over last year, with consolidated comparable store sales increasing 3% over the prior year. Net income was $118 million and diluted earnings per share were $.24, which equalled last year's earnings per share. For the first half of fiscal 2005, net sales were $6.8 billion, 16% over last year, and year-to-date consolidated comparable store sales increased 6% over last year. Net income was $286 million and diluted earnings per share were $.57, up 24% over $.46 per share last year. Edmond English, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., commented, "While our second quarter results did not meet the expectations we had set at the beginning of the year, I am pleased that year-to-date earnings per share are in line with our original plan at the half-year mark. We maintained our inventory discipline when sales trends softened during the second quarter and took higher markdowns to keep merchandise turning and our stores fresh. In this way, we stayed true to our mission of offering our customers rapidly changing merchandise assortments and kept our stores ready for the flow of new, fall product. As we enter the back half of the year, inventories are in great shape, which positions us well to continue to take advantage of the numerous buying opportunities in the marketplace. "At The Marmaxx Group, the combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, second quarter sales increased 6% over last year and comparable store sales increased 2%. Segment profit was $203 million, up 6% over last year, but below our plan. Merchandise margins improved over last year's margins, but did not reach our targeted levels. While trends in men's and home fashions categories remained weak, we are pleased that sales of footwear, accessories and jewelry, which are departments that we are expanding, as well as women's apparel, continued to be very strong. By the end of September, we expect to have completed the majority of the 300 new jewelry/accessories expansions at T.J. Maxx and the 60-plus new footwear departments at Marshalls that we plan for this year, which we believe will benefit the third and fourth quarters. Marmaxx was extremely disciplined in clearing summer merchandise and readying our stores for the fall selling season and inventories are in very good shape. New T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores continue to perform well and we now expect to net a total of 50 stores this year." English continued, "HomeGoods' second quarter sales increased 15% and comparable store sales decreased 1%. Bottom-line results were below last year and our expectations. HomeGoods' second quarter results were impacted by lighter-than-optimal summer, seasonal inventories, which had been in high demand early in the season. That said, we continue to be bullish about this unique concept, which offers great values on a rapidly changing assortment of home fashions. At HomeGoods, we now expect to add 34 stores, which includes both the freestanding and superstore format and represents a 17% increase in selling square footage. "At our Canadian divisions, Winners and HomeSense, second quarter sales increased 19% above last year. Comparable store sales increased 12% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 11% in local currency over the prior year. Winners' segment profit for the quarter increased 16%. These results were primarily due to this division's solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies. Winners did a great job of transitioning seasons and saw strong comparable store sales growth across most major merchandise categories. In addition, we are pleased that our HomeSense concept continues to take hold in Canada, as this young division grows its business. We are on schedule to add 8 Winners and 15 HomeSense stores by the end of 2004, increasing our selling square footage by 13% in Canada this year. "At T.K. Maxx, in the U.K. and Ireland, second quarter sales increased 31% and comparable store sales increased 13% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, T.K. Maxx's comparable store sales increased 1% over a 4% increase the prior year, but were below plan. Segment profit increased 16% over the prior year, but below our expectations, as a result of softer sales trends. Despite the second quarter shortfall in sales, we remain very pleased with the growth of our T.K. Maxx concept. New stores are performing well, there is enthusiastic response to this concept in both existing and new markets, and there are plenty of real estate opportunities for this division as it continues to expand in the U.K. and Ireland. We are on track to grow this division's selling square footage by 26% in 2004, adding a total of 25 stores." English continued, "A.J. Wright posted a 23% increase in sales in the second quarter and a comparable store sales increase of 2% over a very strong 11% increase last year. We believe that our A.J. Wright customers are more sensitive to economic conditions, which impacted this division's results. Due to soft sales and related markdown activity, bottom-line results for this young division were below last year and our expectations. We continue to be excited about the growth potential for this concept, which offers great, off-price values to moderate-income shoppers. This year, we are expanding A.J. Wright to California, with five store openings. We believe this densely populated market holds great growth opportunities for this concept. For the year, we are on schedule to increase this division's selling square footage by 31%, adding 32 stores to A.J. Wright's store base." English continued, "At Bob's Stores, which we acquired in December 2003, total sales were $64 million, which was below our plan. While we expected Bob's Stores to report a loss in the second quarter, the bottom-line impact of soft sales and related markdowns was more than we anticipated. That said, Bob's Stores continued to improve its inventory management discipline during the quarter, making way for fresher, fall merchandise assortments. This was Bob's Stores' second quarter as a TJX division and we continue to refine this business, including working with promotional levels and merchandising strategies. Our plan is to grow this business slowly and deliberately. We plan to open two stores this fall and continue to view Bob's Stores as an excellent long-term growth vehicle. Over the long term, we expect to expand this uniquely positioned concept to 400 stores in the U.S. "We continue to generate significant returns on investment, which gives us the ability to grow our store base and the infrastructure to support it, while simultaneously pursuing our sizable share repurchase program and maintaining our strong financial position. During the second quarter, we spent a total of $171 million, retiring 7.3 million shares of TJX stock, which was more than we had planned." English concluded, "There are many factors that give me confidence in our business. Our inventories are in great shape and we are in a very liquid open-to-buy position, which allows us to continue to pursue our close-to-need buying strategies and offer our customers the right fashions at the right values. We are pleased with customers' enthusiastic response to our assortments of women's fashions and our expanded footwear and jewelry/accessories departments, all of which are important categories in the back half of the year. We also are excited about our upcoming launches of e-commerce websites for our T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods businesses, which we have planned for this fall. New stores across all divisions are performing well, and our very strong financial position continues to serve as a foundation upon which to grow our business this year and beyond."
