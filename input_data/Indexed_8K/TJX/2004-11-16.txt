EXHIBIT 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 16, 2004--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 30, 2004. Net sales for the third quarter were $3.8 billion, a 13% increase over last year, with consolidated comparable store sales increasing 4% over the prior year. Net income was $201 million and diluted earnings per share were $.41, a 14% increase over last year's results. For the first nine months of fiscal 2005, net sales were $10.6 billion, up 15% over last year, and year-to-date consolidated comparable store sales increased 5% over last year. Net income was $487 million, and diluted earnings per share were $.98, up 21% over last year. Edmond English, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., commented, "We are pleased with our third quarter performance, with a comparable store sales increase and bottom-line results in line with our expectations. Further, we achieved this growth over significant growth last year in the third quarter. Our very strong October, when customers responded to seasonably cool weather and an exciting fashion offering, helped us achieve our goals. "At The Marmaxx Group, the combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, third quarter sales increased 5% over last year and comparable store sales increased 2%. Segment profit increased 7% to $284 million and segment profit margin was 10.6%, both over strong performance last year and well above plan. Sales of women's apparel were strong during the quarter. We are delighted with the continued strength of our expanded jewelry/accessories and footwear departments at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, respectively, which substantially benefited our business. By the end of the quarter, we had a total of 292 expanded jewelry/accessories departments at T.J. Maxx, which we believe will continue to benefit us in the fourth quarter, and 61 expanded footwear departments at Marshalls. Inventories are in great shape and we are in an excellent position to flow fresh, exciting gift assortments in apparel and non-apparel categories at compelling values to our stores right up until the holidays." English continued, "HomeGoods' third quarter sales increased 13%, while comparable store sales decreased 1%. Segment profit of $12 million was below last year and our expectations. We continue to refine the merchandise mix and work on improving performance at HomeGoods. For the holidays, we are flowing fresh, decorative and gift merchandise to our stores, offering great values on a unique and rapidly changing assortment of home fashions. "At our Canadian divisions, Winners and HomeSense, third quarter sales increased 23% above last year and comparable store sales increased 10% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, which we believe more meaningfully reflects our operating performance, comparable store sales increased 4%, which was close to plan and over a solid 6% increase last year. Winners' segment profit for the quarter was $39 million, up 7% over last year, but below our expectations. We remain pleased with our HomeSense concept, as this young business expands its market presence in Canada. "At T.K. Maxx, in the U.K. and Ireland, third quarter sales increased 38% and comparable store sales increased 15% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, T.K. Maxx's comparable store sales increased 4%, which was below our expectations, but over a very strong 8% increase the prior year. We are pleased with the broad-based strength across the majority of our merchandise classifications. Segment profit for the quarter was $30 million, a 70% increase over the prior year, and segment profit margin was 8.9%, well above last year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the growth of our T.K. Maxx concept in the U.K. and Ireland." English continued, "A.J. Wright posted a 25% increase in sales in the third quarter and an in-line comparable store sales increase of 3% over a very strong 14% increase last year. In August, sales were soft, primarily because of economic factors that affected A.J. Wright's price-sensitive customer base and caused bottom-line results for the quarter to come in below our expectations and last year. As the quarter progressed, comparable store sales improved significantly, as this division did an excellent job of repositioning its mix to offer great fashion at the right price for its customer base. We continue to be excited about the growth potential for this concept, as we expand into new markets across the country. "At Bob's Stores, which we acquired in December 2003, total sales were $81 million, which was essentially in line with plan, and bottom-line results were slightly better than we had expected. Bob's Stores benefited from strong sales of licensed team apparel on the heels of the Red Sox' World Series win. Early reads from the two stores opened this fall are very positive. We look forward to the holiday selling season at Bob's Stores as a gift destination for family, casual apparel and team gear." English continued, "We continue to generate significant returns on investment, which gives us the ability to grow our store base and the infrastructure to support it, while simultaneously pursuing our sizable share repurchase program and maintaining our strong financial position. During the third quarter, we spent a total of $172 million, which was more than we had planned, retiring 7.9 million shares of TJX stock." English concluded, "As we enter the fourth quarter, we look forward to the opportunities we have in the holiday selling season at all of our divisions. In particular, our Marmaxx jewelry/accessories departments, which are important categories in the fourth quarter, continue to be very strong. Our new e-commerce websites are up and running for the holiday season, giving our customers another channel through which to shop T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods. Additionally, at A.J. Wright, we have year-over-year opportunities in expanded gift assortments for the entire family, including toys and games. Finally, we will continue flowing fresh, exciting gift assortments throughout our off-price chains at great values throughout the holiday season, a successful strategy that we believe will work very well for us again this year."

During the nine months ended October 30, 2004, TJX repurchased 20.8 million shares at a cost of $480.5 million. During the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, TJX repurchased 7.9 million shares of its common stock, at a cost of $172.0 million. Through October 30, 2004, under its current $1 billion multi-year stock repurchase program, TJX has repurchased 13.3 million shares at a cost of $299.2 million. 2. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, TJX has begun to accrue for inventory purchase obligations at the time the inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by the Company. As a result, TJX has recorded an increase to merchandise inventory on its balance sheet as of October 30, 2004, currently estimated at $210 million, to reflect this in-transit inventory, as well as an equivalent increase to accounts payable at that date. TJX is in the process of verifying the increase to inventory and accounts payable at October 30, 2004 and evaluating whether similar changes to balance sheets for prior periods will be required. This accrual for inventory in transit affects only the reported levels of inventory and accounts payable on the balance sheet, and has no impact on TJX's operating results, cash flows, liquidity or shareholders' equity. 3. Certain amounts in the prior period's financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year's presentation. CONTACT: The TJX Companies, Inc.
