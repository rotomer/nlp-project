Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, but is not obligated, to charge the accounts of the Borrower maintained with Bank of America into which proceeds of Syndicated Advances are remitted pursuant to Section 2.6 for each payment of interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder, for each payment of principal, in accordance with the applicable Prepayment Notice or when otherwise due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof. 2.12 Evidence of Debt (Optional Syndicated Notes); Telephonic Notices. (a) Evidence of Debt (Optional Syndicated Notes). (i) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Syndicated Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (ii) The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (a) the amount of each Syndicated Loan made hereunder, and, to the extent applicable, the Type thereof and the interest period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof. (iii) The entries in the accounts maintained pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. In the event of a conflict between the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts maintained by a Lender, the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 21
(iv) Any Lender may request that its Syndicated Loans be evidenced by one or more Syndicated Notes. In such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender the applicable Syndicated Note or Syndicated Notes payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter, the Syndicated Loans evidenced by any such Syndicated Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more Syndicated Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Syndicated Note for cancellation and requests that such Syndicated Loans once again be evidenced as described in clauses (i) and (ii) above. (b) Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Syndicated Advances and effect selections of Types of Syndicated Advances based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent of the relevant telephonic notice shall govern absent manifest error. 2.13 Notification of Syndicated Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Syndicated Advance Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice and Prepayment Notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. 2.14 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Syndicated Loans at any one or more Lending Installations selected by such Lender and may change any such Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and any Syndicated Notes requested by such Lender shall be deemed held by such Lender for the benefit of such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written or telex notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through which Syndicated Loans will be made by it and for whose account Syndicated Loan payments are to be made. 2.15 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Syndicated Loan or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume 22
that such payment has been made. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (a) in the case of repayment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (b) in the case of repayment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Syndicated Loan. 2.16 Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Syndicated Notes (if requested) without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form, further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two additional copies of such form (or any successor form or related form as may from time to time be required under applicable law) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Syndicated Notes (if requested) without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax. 2.17 Termination. All unpaid Obligations shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the Facility Termination Date; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.17 shall be construed as limiting or modifying the obligation of the Borrower to repay any or all of the outstanding Obligations at any earlier time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 2.18 Pricing. The Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate for any period shall be determined on the basis of the publicly 23
announced ratings ("Credit Ratings") by Moody's and S&P on the Borrower's Rated Debt during such period, in each case in accordance with the table set forth below, to change when and as such Credit Ratings change. For purposes of determining the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate with respect to any period: (i) Any change in the Credit Rating shall be deemed to become effective on the date of public announcement thereof and shall remain in effect until the date of public announcement that such Credit Rating shall no longer be in effect. If any change in Credit Rating occurs during an Interest Period, the new Eurodollar Applicable Margin, Applicable Facility Fee Rate and Applicable Utilization Fee Rate shall become effective from the date of the public announcement. (ii) If, during any period, either Moody's or S&P shall not have a publicly-announced Credit Rating with respect to the Borrower's Rated Debt, the Credit Rating announced by the other rating agency with respect thereto shall be used. (iii) Except as provided below, in the event that the Credit Ratings publicly announced by Moody's and S&P with respect to the Borrower's Rated Debt appear in more than one column of the table, the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate will be based on the column which includes the highest rating; provided, however, that if there exists a differential of two or more levels between the Credit Rating publicly announced by Moody's and the Credit Rating publicly announced by S & P, then the Credit Rating which is one level below the higher announced Credit Rating will determine the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate. (iv) If, during any period, neither Moody's nor S&P shall have publicly announced a Credit Rating with respect to the Borrower's Rated Debt, the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate shall be the margins set forth under the column entitled "No Other Pricing Level Applies."

ARTICLE III CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES 3.1 Yield Protection. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, or the compliance by any Lender therewith, (a) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from payments due from the Borrower (excluding federal taxation of the overall net income of any Lender, franchise taxes and branch profit taxes), or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in respect of its Syndicated Loans or other amounts due it hereunder, or (b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or (c) imposes any other condition, in each case, the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining Syndicated Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with Syndicated Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Syndicated Loans held, or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or reduction in an amount received which such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to making, funding and maintaining its Syndicated Loans and its Commitment. 3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines that the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation 25
controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below in this Section 3.2), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Syndicated Loans or its obligation to make Syndicated Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's or such controlling corporation's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (a) any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines (as defined below in this Section 3.2) or (b) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (a) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement, including transition rules, and (b) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any circumstances that would cause the Borrower to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.2, provided that, except as set forth in Section 3.5(b), the failure to give such notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligation to pay such additional amounts hereunder. 3.3 Availability of Types of Syndicated Advances. If any Lender reasonably determines that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders reasonably determine that (a) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not available or (b) the interest rate applicable to a Type of Syndicated Advance does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining such Syndicated Advance, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of Syndicated Advance. 3.4 Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment, conversion or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not made (whether by borrowing, continuation or conversion) on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, or an optional prepayment, notice of which has been given in accordance with Section 2.5, is not made on the date specified therefor in such notice, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the Eurodollar Advance. 26
3.5 Mitigation; Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. (a) To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the unavailability of a Type of Syndicated Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender in its reasonable determination. If the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Advances has been suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 as a consequence of a determination by any Lender that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law or any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 3.1 or 3.2, the Borrower may elect (i) subject to Section 3.4, to prepay any outstanding Syndicated Advances to the extent necessary to mitigate its liability under Section 3.1 or 3.2, or (ii) to require the applicable Lender to assign its outstanding Syndicated Loans and Commitment hereunder to another financial institution designated by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The obligation of a Lender to assign its rights and obligations hereunder as contemplated by this Section 3.5(a) is subject to the requirements that (x) all amounts owing to that Lender under the Loan Documents are paid in full upon the completion of such assignment and (y) any assignment is effected in accordance with the terms of Section 12.3 and on terms otherwise satisfactory to that Lender (it being understood that the Borrower or the replacement Lender shall pay the processing fee payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.3.2 in connection with any such assignment). (b) In determining the amounts payable under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4, each Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to make its allocations and computations, to the extent readily determinable, consistent with the allocations and computations applied generally by such Lender to other customers of similar size and credit quality and under similar circumstances. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Borrower of the written statement. The Borrower shall not be liable for any amounts under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4 accruing more than 120 days prior to the receipt of a demand for payment therefor. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. ARTICLE IV CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 4.1 Effectiveness; Initial Syndicated Advance. This Agreement shall become effective and the Lenders shall be obligated to make the initial Syndicated Advance only after the Administrative Agent shall have received from the Borrower, with sufficient copies (other than in the case of any requested Syndicated Notes) for each of the Lenders, each of the following items in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent: 27
(a) a copy of the certificate of incorporation (or comparable constitutive document) of the Borrower, together with all amendments thereto and a certificate of good standing, certified by the appropriate governmental officer of its jurisdiction of organization and by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or other appropriate officer of the Borrower; (b) copies, certified by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Borrower of its by-laws (or any comparable constitutive laws, rules or regulations) and of its board of directors' resolutions (and resolutions of other bodies, if any are deemed necessary by counsel for any Lender) authorizing the execution of the Loan Documents; (c) incumbency certificates, executed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Borrower, which shall identify by name and title and bear the signature of the officers of the Borrower authorized to sign the Loan Documents and to make borrowings hereunder, as applicable, upon which certificate the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely until informed of any change in writing by the Borrower; (d) a certificate, signed by the Chief Financial Officer, stating that on the date hereof no Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing; (e) evidence of the payment of all fees required to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to the Fee Letters; (f) opinions of (i) Ropes & Gray LLP, counsel to the Borrower, and (ii) a Senior Vice President-Legal of the Borrower, substantially in the forms attached as Exhibit B hereto; (g) evidence of delivery of the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement by each of the parties thereto; (h) written money transfer instructions, in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto, addressed to the Administrative Agent and signed by an Authorized Officer, together with such other related money transfer authorizations as the Administrative Agent may have reasonably requested; (i) evidence of the termination of the Existing Credit Agreements and repayment of in full of all obligations, indebtedness and liabilities outstanding thereunder from the proceeds of the initial Syndicated Loans hereunder and/or the initial "Syndicated Loans" under and as defined in the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement; and (j) such other documents as any Lender or its counsel may have reasonably requested (including, without limitation, any Syndicated Notes requested pursuant to Section 2.12(a)(iv)). 4.2 Each Syndicated Advance. No Lender shall be required to make any Syndicated Loan hereunder unless on the applicable Borrowing Date: 28
(a) there exists no Default or Unmatured Default; (b) the representations and warranties contained in Article V are true and correct as of such Borrowing Date (other than the representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.5, which shall only be made by the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement) except to the extent any such representation or warranty is stated to relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct on and as of such earlier date; (c) after giving effect to such Syndicated Loan and the other Syndicated Loans being made as a part of such Syndicated Advance, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Syndicated Advances does not exceed the Aggregate Commitment; and (d) all legal matters incident to the making of such Syndicated Advance shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders and their counsel. Each Syndicated Advance Borrowing Notice and each Conversion/Continuation Notice with respect to a Syndicated Loan shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the conditions contained in Sections 4.2(a), (b) and (c) have been satisfied. ARTICLE V REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Syndicated Loans and the other financial accommodations to the Borrower described herein, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender as follows as of the date of this Agreement, the date of the initial extension of credit hereunder and thereafter on each date as required by Section 4.2 that: 5.1 Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Subsidiaries which in the aggregate own, directly or indirectly, less than ten percent (10%) of the total consolidated assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries) (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign organization and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified, except those jurisdictions where the failure to be in good standing or to so qualify is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) has all requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its property and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and as proposed to be conducted. 5.2 Authorization and Validity. (a) The Borrower has the requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority to execute, deliver and perform each of the Loan Documents which have been or are to be executed by it. 29
(b) The execution, delivery and performance, as the case may be, of each of the Loan Documents executed by the Borrower, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly approved by the board of directors and, if necessary, the shareholders of the Borrower, and such approvals have not been rescinded. No other corporate or other organizational action or proceedings on the part of the Borrower is necessary to consummate such transactions. (c) Each of the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party has been duly executed or delivered, as the case may be, by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally), is in full force and effect and no material term or condition thereof has been amended, modified or waived without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders if so required under Section 8.2), and the Borrower has performed and complied with all the terms, provisions, agreements and conditions set forth therein and required to be performed or complied with by the Borrower and no unmatured default, default or breach of any covenant by any such party exists thereunder. 5.3 No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or the Borrower's articles of incorporation or by-laws (or any comparable constitutive laws, rules or regulations) or the provisions of any material indenture, instrument or material agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such material indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, any Governmental Authority is required to authorize, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents, except (i) such as have been made or obtained as set forth on Schedule 5.3 or (ii) such as set forth on Schedule 5.3 hereto which have not been obtained or made and which are immaterial. 5.4 Financial Statements. The January 29, 2005 audited consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders were prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their operations for the period then ended. 30
5.5 Material Adverse Change. As of the date of this Agreement, since January 29, 2005 with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, there has been no material adverse change in the business, financial condition, operations, performance or Property of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 5.6 Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith, as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP and as to which no tax lien has been filed. The United States income tax returns of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service, or the Internal Revenue Service has allowed the Statute of Limitations for audit to expire, for fiscal years ended January 29, 2000 and prior (provided that the year ending January 29, 2000 remains open only in respect of items from later years carried back to such year). No tax liens have been filed and remain in effect with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. No written claims of taxing authorities are pending and being made, and no other claims are, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Borrower, pending against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case (i) except claims which are being actively contested by the Borrower or such Subsidiary in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Borrower or such Subsidiary has established such reserves or made other appropriate provisions as shall be required in conformity with GAAP; and (ii) which could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges have been established in accordance with GAAP and, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Borrower, are adequate. 5.7 Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.7 hereto, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge of any of their executive officers, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Other than any liability incident to such litigation, arbitration or proceedings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have no material contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 5.4. 5.8 Subsidiaries. Schedule 5.8 hereto contains an accurate list of all of the presently existing Subsidiaries of the Borrower, setting forth their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their respective equity held by the Borrower or other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. 31

Neither the Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group has any potential liability, whether direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise, under Section 4069, 4204 or 4212(c) of ERISA. Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and regulations and has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan, neither the Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so, no steps have been taken to reorganize or terminate any Plan, no event has occurred which imposes an obligation on the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group under Section 4041 of ERISA to provide affected parties written notice of intent to terminate a Plan in a distress termination described in Section 4041(c) of ERISA; no event or condition has occurred which is reasonably likely to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any Plan, in any such case where such event could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5.10 Accuracy of Information. No written information, certificate, exhibit or report furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders (including the Loan Documents and any representation or warranty therein) contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. 5.11 Regulations T, U and X. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) constitutes less than 25% of those assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction hereunder. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged in the business of purchasing or carrying margin stock. 5.12 Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in (i) any agreement to which it is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Material Indebtedness. 5.13 Compliance With Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over 32
the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective Property except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.13 hereto, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with any Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law or the subject of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a release of any petroleum, toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5.14 Ownership of Property. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.14 hereto, on the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have good title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.15, to all of the Property and assets reflected in the financial statements referred to in Section 5.4 as owned by it. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries owns (or is licensed to use) all Intellectual Property which is necessary or appropriate in any material respect for the conduct of its respective business as conducted on the date of this Agreement, without any material conflict with the rights of any other Person. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is aware of (i) any material existing or threatened infringement or misappropriation of any of its Intellectual Property by any third party or (ii) any material third party claim that any aspect of the business of the Borrower or any Subsidiary (as conducted on the date of this Agreement) infringes or will infringe upon, any Intellectual Property or other property right of any other Person, in each case that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5.15 Labor Matters. There are no labor controversies pending or, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries are in substantial compliance in all material respects with the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended. 5.16 Investment Company Act.

No delay or omission of the Lenders or any of them or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Syndicated Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Syndicated Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by (or with the consent of) the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or afforded by law shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full. ARTICLE IX GENERAL PROVISIONS 9.1 Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive delivery hereof (including any Syndicated Notes) and the making of the Syndicated Loans herein contemplated. 47
9.2 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation. 9.3 Taxes; Stamp Duties. Any taxes (excluding taxes (including net income taxes, franchise taxes and branch profit taxes) as are imposed on or measured by such Lender's net income by the United States of America or any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender is organized or maintains its Lending Installation) or other similar assessments or charges made by any Governmental Authority or revenue authority in respect of the Loan Documents shall be paid by the Borrower, together with interest and penalties, if any, as provided in Section 3.1. The Borrower shall pay and forthwith on demand indemnify each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender against any liability it incurs in respect of any stamp, registration and similar tax which is or becomes payable in connection with the entry into, performance or enforcement of any Loan Document. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Syndicated Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under this Section 9.3, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender in its reasonable determination. If any Lender has demanded compensation under this Section 9.3, the Borrower may elect to require the applicable Lender to assign its outstanding Syndicated Loans and Commitment hereunder to another financial institution designated by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The obligation of a Lender to assign its rights and obligations hereunder as contemplated by this Section 9.3 is subject to the requirements that (x) all amounts owing to that Lender under the Loan Documents are paid in full upon the completion of such assignment and (y) any assignment is effected in accordance with the terms of Section 12.3 and on terms otherwise satisfactory to that Lender (it being understood that the Borrower or the replacement Lender shall pay the processing fee payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.3.2 in connection with any such assignment). 9.4 Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for convenience of reference only and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the provisions of the Loan Documents. 9.5 Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof. 9.6 Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the 48
Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties (and their directors, officers and employees with respect to Section 9.7 to this Agreement) and their respective successors and assigns. 9.7 Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers; which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers or of one outside counsel, but not both) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, review, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders for any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of not more than three firms of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of such persons) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender in connection with the restructuring, workout, collection and/or enforcement of the Loan Documents. (b) The Borrower further agrees to defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each and all of the Arrangers and each of their respective Affiliates, and each of such Person's respective officers, directors, employees, partners, managers, shareholders, attorneys and agents (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys and paralegals for such Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be designated a party thereto), imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising out of: (i) this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any act, event or transaction related or attendant thereto or to the making of the Syndicated Loans hereunder, the management of such Syndicated Loans, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Syndicated Loans hereunder, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents; or (ii) any liabilities, obligations, responsibilities, losses, damages, personal injury, death, punitive damages, economic damages, consequential damages, treble damages, intentional, willful or wanton injury, damage or threat to the environment, natural resources or public health or welfare, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney, expert and consulting fees and costs of investigation, feasibility or remedial action studies), fines, penalties and monetary sanctions and interest, direct or indirect, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, past, present or future relating to violation of any Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law arising from or in connection with the past, present or future operations of the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors in interest, or, the past, 49
present or future environmental, health or safety condition of any respective Property of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, the presence of asbestos-containing materials at any respective property of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the release or threatened release of any petroleum, toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment (collectively, the "Indemnified Matters"); provided, however, the Borrower shall have no obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder with respect to Indemnified Matters caused solely by or resulting solely from the willful misconduct or Gross Negligence of such Indemnitee as determined by the final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, the Borrower shall contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law, to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Matters incurred by the Indemnitees. (c) The Borrower further agrees to assert no claim against any of the Indemnitees on any theory of liability for consequential, special, indirect, exemplary or punitive damages. No settlement shall be entered into by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any claim, litigation, arbitration or other proceeding relating to or arising out of the transaction evidenced by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other Indemnitee is a party thereto) unless such settlement releases all Indemnitees from any and all liability with respect thereto. After submission of a written request to an Indemnitee from the Borrower detailing the nature of any claim, litigation, arbitration or other proceeding which relates to or arises out of the transaction evidenced by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, such Indemnitee shall inform the Borrower as to whether it will require compliance with the provisions of this clause (c) or whether it will waive such compliance, any waiver of which shall be applicable only for such Indemnitee. (d) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 9.8 Numbers of Documents. Subject to Section 13.1 hereof, all statements, notices, closing documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent with sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent, if it deems appropriate, may furnish one to each of the Lenders. 9.9 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with GAAP. If any changes in GAAP are hereafter required or permitted and are adopted by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with the agreement of its independent certified public accountants and such changes result in a change in the method of calculation of any of the financial covenants, restrictions or standards herein or in the related definitions or terms used therein ("Accounting Changes"), the parties hereto agree, at the Borrower's request, to enter into 50
negotiations, in good faith, in order to amend such provisions in a credit neutral manner so as to reflect equitably such Accounting Changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' financial condition shall be the same after such Accounting Changes as if such Accounting Changes had not been made; provided, however, until such provisions are amended in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, no Accounting Change shall be given effect in such calculations and all financial statements and reports required to be delivered hereunder shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP without taking into account such Accounting Changes. In the event such amendment is entered into, all references in this Agreement to GAAP shall mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect as of the date of such amendment. 9.10 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable. 9.11 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, on the other hand, shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to review or inform the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any matter in connection with any phase of the business or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 9.12 GOVERNING LAW. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ACCEPTS THIS AGREEMENT, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE LENDERS, AT NEW YORK, NEW YORK BY ACKNOWLEDGING AND AGREEING TO IT THERE. ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE BORROWER AND ANY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER, OR ANY OTHER HOLDER OF THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED TO OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS) OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS. 51

Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential information which it may receive from the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure (i) to other Lenders and its and their respective Affiliates, Transferees and prospective Transferees (each of whom by its acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by the terms of this Section 9.14), (ii) in confidence to legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors to that Lender or to Transferees or prospective Transferees pursuant to Section 12.5, (iii) to regulatory officials, (iv) 53

ARTICLE X THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 10.1 Appointment; Nature of Relationship. Bank of America is appointed by the Lenders as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the contractual representative of such Person with the rights and duties expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Administrative Agent" or "agent" in reference to Bank of America, it is expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement and that the Administrative Agent is merely acting as the representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as such contractual representative, the Administrative Agent (i) does not assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of Section 9-102 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender waives. 10.2 Powers. The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no implied duties or fiduciary duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents required to be taken by the Administrative Agent. 10.3 General Immunity. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates nor their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower or any Lender 54
for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen solely from the Gross Negligence or willful misconduct of such Person. 10.4 No Responsibility for Syndicated Loans, Creditworthiness, Collateral, Recitals, Etc. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any extension of credit hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other obligor under any Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (iv) the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; or (v) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, legality, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial condition of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent will use its reasonable efforts to distribute to each of the Lenders, in a timely fashion, a copy of all written reports, certificates and information required to be supplied by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; provided that any failure in such regard shall not result in any liability on the part of the Administrative Agent and provided, further that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (either in its capacity as Administrative Agent or in its individual capacity) or any of its Affiliates. 10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders (as applicable under Section 8.2 or under any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document), and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders and any other holders of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction (which shall not include any requirement that it be indemnified for its willful misconduct or Gross Negligence) by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. 55
10.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and all matters pertaining to the Administrative Agent's duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document. 10.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Loan Document, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document (including any electronic transmission) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent or given by the proper person or persons, and, in respect of legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Administrative Agent and which counsel may have acted as counsel for the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 10.8 The Administrative Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including with respect to any disagreement between or among any of the Administrative Agent or Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen solely from the Gross Negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. 10.9 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Commitment, Syndicated Loans made by it, and Syndicated Notes (if any) issued to it, Bank of America (or any other Person succeeding it as the Administrative Agent) shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document as any Lender, and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise 56
indicates, include Bank of America (or any other Person succeeding it as the Administrative Agent) in its individual capacity. Bank of America (or any other Person succeeding it as the Administrative Agent) and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Person is not prohibited hereby from engaging with any other Person. 10.10 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 10.11 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, without the consent of the Borrower and on behalf of the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may appoint, without the consent of the Borrower and on behalf of the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall be a Lender unless no Lender shall so agree in which event such successor Administrative Agent may be a Person of the Administrative Agent's choosing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, each such successor Administrative Agent shall be subject to approval by the Borrower, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. 57
10.12 No Duties Imposed on Syndication Agents, Documentation Agents or Arrangers. None of the Persons identified on the cover page to this Agreement, the signature pages to this Agreement or otherwise in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent," "Documentation Agent" or "Arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, if such Person is a Lender, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Persons identified on the cover page to this Agreement, the signature pages to this Agreement or otherwise in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent," "Documentation Agent" or "Arranger" shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary duty to or fiduciary relationship with any Lender. In addition to the agreement set forth in Section 10.12, each of the Lenders acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. 10.13 Administrative Agent's Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by separate letter agreement, or as otherwise agreed from time to time. ARTICLE XI SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS 11.1 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default or Unmatured Default occurs and is continuing, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due. 11.2 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Syndicated Loans (other than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Syndicated Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Syndicated Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Syndicated Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made. 58
11.3 Application of Payments. The Administrative Agent shall, unless otherwise specified at the direction of the Required Lenders which direction shall be consistent with the last sentence of this Section 11.3, apply all payments and prepayments in respect of any Obligations in the following order: (a) first, to pay interest on and then principal of any portion of the Syndicated Loans which the Administrative Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Lender for which the Administrative Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower; (b) second, to pay Obligations in respect of any fees, expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such; (c) third, to the ratable payment of Obligations in respect of any fees, expenses, reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders; (d) fourth, to pay interest due in respect of Syndicated Loans; (e) fifth, to the ratable payment or prepayment of principal outstanding on Syndicated Loans in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine in its sole discretion; and (f) sixth, to the ratable payment of all other Obligations. Unless otherwise designated (which designation shall only be applicable if no Default has occurred and is continuing) by the Borrower or unless otherwise mandated by the terms of this Agreement, all principal payments in respect of Syndicated Loans shall be applied first, to repay outstanding Floating Rate Loans, and then to repay outstanding Eurodollar Loans with those Eurodollar Loans which have earlier expiring Interest Periods being repaid prior to those which have later expiring Interest Periods. The order of priority set forth in this Section 11.3 and the related provisions of this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as among themselves. The order of priority set forth in clauses (d) through (h) of this Section 11.3 may at any time and from time to time be changed by the Required Lenders without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by Borrower or any other Person. The order of priority set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 11.3 may be changed only with the prior written consent of the Administrative. ARTICLE XII BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS 12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (a) the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the consent of all of the Lenders and (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3. Notwithstanding clause (b) of the preceding sentence, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the 59
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Syndicated Notes to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Syndicated Loan or which holds any Syndicated Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Administrative Agent. Any assignee or transferee of the rights to any Syndicated Loan or any Syndicated Note agrees by acceptance of such transfer or assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Syndicated Loan (whether or not a Syndicated Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of the rights to such Syndicated Loan. 12.2 Participations. 12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other Eligible Participants (a "Participant") participating interests in any Syndicated Loan owing to such Lender, any Syndicated Note held by such Lender, the Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Syndicated Loans and the holder of any Syndicated Note issued to it for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. The participation agreement effecting the sale of any participating interest shall contain a representation by the Participant to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the participating interest in the Commitment and Syndicated Loans under such participation agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Participant in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. 12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Syndicated Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require the consent of such Participant under Section 8.2(a) if such Participant were a Lender. 12.2.3 Benefit of Setoff and Other Provisions. The Borrower agrees that to the extent permitted by law each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each 60
Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to make any payment with respect to such Sections which is greater than the amount that the Borrower would have paid to the Lender had no such participating interest been sold. 12.3 Assignments. 12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or more commercial banks ("Purchasers") all or any part of its Commitment and outstanding Syndicated Loans, together with its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents with respect thereto; provided, however, that the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of such assignment) may be in the amount of such Lender's entire Commitment but otherwise shall not be less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective (neither of which consents may be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required. 12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the Administrative Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached to Exhibit D hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (b) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Syndicated Loans under the applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto and thereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Syndicated Loans assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if the transferor Lender desires that its Syndicated Loans be evidenced by Syndicated Notes, replacement Syndicated Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and, if the Purchaser desires that its Syndicated Loans be evidenced by Syndicated Notes, new Syndicated Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Syndicated Notes, are issued to such 61
Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting its Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment. 12.4 Designated Lenders. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12.4(a), any Lender may from time to time elect to designate an Eligible Designee to provide all or any part of the Syndicated Loans to be made by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement; provided the designation of an Eligible Designee by any Lender for purposes of this Section 12.4(a) shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) and the Administrative Agent (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Upon the execution by the parties to each such designation of an agreement in the form of Exhibit I hereto (a "Designation Agreement") and the acceptance thereof by the Borrower (if required) and the Administrative Agent, the Eligible Designee shall become a Designated Lender for purposes of this Agreement. The Designating Lender shall thereafter have the right to permit the Designated Lender to provide all or a portion of the Syndicated Loans to be made by the Designating Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the making of such Syndicated Loans or portion thereof shall satisfy the obligation of the Designating Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Syndicated Loan was made by the Designating Lender. As to any Syndicated Loan made by it, each Designated Lender shall have all the rights a Lender making such Syndicated Loan would have under this Agreement and otherwise; provided, (x) that all voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by the Designating Lender and (y) each Designating Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for its obligations under this Agreement, including the obligations of a Lender in respect of Syndicated Loans made by its Designated Lender. If the Designating Lender's Syndicated Loans are evidenced by Syndicated Notes, no additional Syndicated Notes shall be required with respect to Syndicated Loans provided by a Designated Lender; provided, however, to the extent any Designated Lender shall advance funds, the Designating Lender shall be deemed to hold any Syndicated Notes in its possession as an agent for such Designated Lender to the extent of the Syndicated Loan funded by such Designated Lender. Such Designating Lender shall act as administrative agent for its Designated Lender and give and receive notices and communications hereunder. Any payments for the account of any Designated Lender shall be paid to its Designating Lender as administrative agent for such Designated Lender and neither the Borrower nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for any Designating Lender's application of any such payments. In addition, any Designated Lender may (i) with notice to, but without the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, assign all or portions of its interests in any Syndicated Loans to its Designating Lender or to any financial institution consented to by the Borrower (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) and the Administrative Agent providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such Designated Lender and (ii) subject to advising any such Person that such information is to be treated as confidential in accordance with such Person's customary practices for dealing with confidential, non-public information, disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Syndicated Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any guarantee, surety or credit or liquidity enhancement to such Designated Lender. (b) Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that it shall not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against any Designated Lender any bankruptcy, 62
reorganization, arrangements, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law for one year and a day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any Designated Lender; provided that the Designating Lender for each Designated Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage and expense arising out of their inability to institute any such proceeding against such Designated Lender. This Section 12.4(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 12.5 Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.14 of this Agreement. 12.6 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 2.18. ARTICLE XIII NOTICES 13.1 Giving Notice. (a) Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.14(b) with respect to telephonic notices or as elsewhere provided herein, all notices and other communications provided to any party hereto under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in writing or by telex or by facsimile and addressed or delivered to such party at its address set forth below its signature hereto or at such other address as may be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties. Any notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage prepaid, shall be deemed given when received; any notice, if transmitted by telex or facsimile, shall be deemed given when transmitted (answerback confirmed in the case of telexes). (b) The Borrower hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may make available to the Lenders materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder, including, but not limited to, any documents furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 6.1 (collectively, "Borrower Materials") by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks or another similar electronic system (the "Platform"). The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked "PUBLIC" as being suitable only for posting on the portion of the Platform not designated "Public Investor". The Borrower acknowledges that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND 63
"AS AVAILABLE." THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents (collectively, the "Agent Parties") have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower's or the Administrative Agent's transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final judgment to have resulted from the Gross Negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Borrower Materials have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Borrower Materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender's e-mail address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address. 13.2 Change of Address. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto. ARTICLE XIV COUNTERPARTS This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. Subject to Section 4.1, this Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Administrative Agent by telex or telephone that it has taken such action. 64
ARTICLE XV USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Patriot Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.

The proceeds of any such Floating Rate Advance shall be used to repay the Swing Line Loan and interest thereon.

In addition to the foregoing, if for any reason any Lender fails to make payment to the Administrative Agent of any amount due under this Section 2.9(d), such Lender shall be deemed, at the option of the Administrative Agent, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Swing Line Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest in and participation in the applicable Swing Line Loan in the amount of the Loan such Lender was required to make pursuant to this Section 2.9(d) and such interest and participation may be recovered from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for each day during the period commencing on the date of demand by the Administrative Agent and ending on the date such obligation is fully satisfied. 2.10 Intentionally Deleted. 2.11 Facility Fee; Utilization Fee; Adjustments in Aggregate Commitment.

The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Syndicated Advances and effect selections of Types of Syndicated Advances based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent of the relevant telephonic notice shall govern absent manifest error. 2.15 Notification of Syndicated Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice and Prepayment Notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. 2.16 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any one or more Lending Installations selected by such Lender and may change any such Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and any Notes requested by such Lender shall be deemed held by such Lender for the benefit of such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written or telex notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made. 2.17 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment -25-
of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (a) in the case of repayment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (b) in the case of repayment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan. 2.18 Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes (if requested) without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form, further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two additional copies of such form (or any successor form or related form as may from time to time be required under applicable law) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes (if requested) without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax. 2.19 Termination. All unpaid Obligations shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the Facility Termination Date; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.19 shall be construed as limiting or modifying the obligation of the Borrower to repay any or all of the outstanding Obligations at any earlier time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. -26-
2.20 Letter of Credit Facility. 2.20.1 Obligation to Issue. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations, warranties and covenants of the Borrower herein set forth, each Issuing Lender hereby severally agrees to issue for the account of the Borrower through such Issuing Lender's branches as it and the Borrower may jointly agree, one or more Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars in accordance with this Section 2.20, from time to time during the period, commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date; provided, however, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after taking into account such issuance, the aggregate L/C Obligations outstanding under Letters of Credit issued by it would exceed the amount specified on Schedule 2.20 next to its name. Schedule 2.20 may be updated from time to time by the Administrative Agent in connection with the addition of any Issuing Lender. 2.20.2 Types and Amounts. No Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to and no Issuing Lender shall: (i) issue any Letter of Credit if on the date of issuance, before or after giving effect to the Letter of Credit requested hereunder, (a) the amount of the Syndicated Advances, the L/C Obligations and the Swing Line Loans outstanding at such time would exceed the Aggregate Commitment or (b) the aggregate outstanding amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed $150,000,000; or (ii) issue any Letter of Credit which has an expiration date later than the date which is the earlier of one (1) year after the date of issuance thereof or three (3) Business Days immediately preceding the Facility Termination Date. 2.20.3 Conditions. In addition to being subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, the obligation of an Issuing Lender to issue any Letter of Credit is subject to the satisfaction in full of the following conditions: (i) the Borrower shall have delivered to the applicable Issuing Lender at such times and in such manner as such Issuing Lender may reasonably prescribe, a written request for issuance of such Letter of Credit, duly executed applications for such Letter of Credit, and such other documents, instructions and agreements as may be reasonably required pursuant to the terms thereof, and the proposed Letter of Credit shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Lender as to form and content; and (ii) as of the date of issuance no order, judgment or decree of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain the applicable Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit and no law, rule or regulation applicable to such Issuing Lender and no request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from a Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from the issuance of Letters of Credit generally or the issuance of that Letter of Credit. -27-
If any provision in a letter of credit application delivered in connection with the foregoing is inconsistent with or more restrictive than a provision contained in this Agreement, the provisions contained in this Agreement shall control. 2.20.4 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.20 and provided that the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 hereof have been satisfied, the applicable Issuing Lender shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit on behalf of the Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Lender's usual and customary business practices and, in this connection, such Issuing Lender may assume that the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.2 hereof have been satisfied unless it shall have received notice to the contrary from a Lender or has knowledge that the applicable conditions have not been met. (b) The applicable Issuing Lender shall give the Administrative Agent written or telex notice, or telephonic notice confirmed promptly thereafter in writing, of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not result in any liability on the part of such Issuing Lender. (c) No Issuing Lender shall extend or amend any Letter of Credit unless the requirements of this Section 2.20 are met as though a new Letter of Credit was being requested and issued. 2.20.5 Letter of Credit Participation. Unless a Lender shall have notified the Issuing Lender, prior to its issuance of a Letter of Credit, that any applicable condition precedent set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 had not then been satisfied immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit hereunder, each Lender shall be deemed to have automatically, irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the applicable Issuing Lender an undivided interest and participation in and to such Letter of Credit, the obligations of the Borrower in respect thereof, and the liability of such Issuing Lender thereunder (collectively, an "L/C Interest") in an amount equal to the amount available for drawing under such Letter of Credit multiplied by such Lender's Pro Rata Share. Each Issuing Lender will notify each Lender promptly upon presentation to it of an L/C Draft or upon any other draw under a Letter of Credit. On or before the Business Day on which an Issuing Lender makes payment of each such L/C Draft or, in the case of any other draw on a Letter of Credit, on demand by the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall make payment to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender, in immediately available funds in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of such payment or draw. The obligation of each Lender to reimburse the Issuing Lenders under this Section 2.20.5 shall be unconditional, continuing, irrevocable and absolute. In the event that any Lender fails to make payment to the Administrative Agent of any amount due under this Section 2.20.5, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, retain and apply against such obligation the principal and interest otherwise payable to such Lender hereunder until the Administrative Agent receives such payment (together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date due until the date paid) from such Lender or such obligation is otherwise fully satisfied; provided, however, that nothing contained in this sentence shall relieve such Lender of its obligation to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender for such amount in accordance with this Section 2.20.5. -28-
2.20.6 Reimbursement Obligation. The Borrower agrees unconditionally, irrevocably and absolutely to pay immediately to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender and the Lenders, the amount of each advance which may be drawn under or pursuant to a Letter of Credit or an L/C Draft related thereto (such obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Administrative Agent for an advance made under a Letter of Credit or L/C Draft being hereinafter referred to as a "Reimbursement Obligation" with respect to such Letter of Credit or L/C Draft). If the Borrower at any time fails to repay a Reimbursement Obligation pursuant to this Section 2.20.6, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to borrow Floating Rate Loans from the Lenders, as of the date of the advance giving rise to the Reimbursement Obligation, equal in amount to the amount of the unpaid Reimbursement Obligation. Such Floating Rate Loans shall be made as of the date of the payment giving rise to such Reimbursement Obligation, automatically, without notice and without any requirement to satisfy the conditions precedent otherwise applicable to a Syndicated Advance of Floating Rate Loans. Such Floating Rate Loans shall constitute a Floating Rate Advance, the proceeds of which Floating Rate Advance shall be used to repay such Reimbursement Obligation. If, for any reason, the Borrower fails to repay a Reimbursement Obligation on the day such Reimbursement Obligation arises and, for any reason, the Lenders are unable to make or have no obligation to make Floating Rate Loans, then such Reimbursement Obligation shall bear interest from and after such day, until paid in full, at the interest rate applicable to a Floating Rate Advance. 2.20.7 Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (a) to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a letter of credit fee equal to (i) for standby Letters of Credit, the Eurodollar Applicable Margin in effect from time to time on the aggregate daily amount available for drawing under the outstanding standby Letters of Credit and (ii) for commercial Letters of Credit, fifty percent (50%) of the Eurodollar Applicable Margin in effect from time to time on the aggregate daily amount available for drawing under the outstanding commercial Letters of Credit, such fees described in clauses (a)(i) and (ii) to be paid in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Facility Termination Date and (b) to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Lenders, a fronting fee in an amount agreed to between the Borrower and the applicable Issuing Lender on the aggregate daily amount available for drawing under their respective outstanding Letters of Credit, to be paid in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Facility Termination Date and all customary fees and other issuance, amendment, negotiation and presentment expenses and related charges in connection with the issuance, amendment, presentation of L/C Drafts, and the like customarily charged by the applicable Issuing Lender with respect to standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit, including, without limitation, standard commissions with respect to commercial letters of credit, payable at the time of invoice of such amounts. 2.20.8 Issuing Lender Reporting Requirements. In addition to the notices required by Section 2.20.4, each Issuing Lender shall, no later than the tenth Business Day following the last day of each month, provide to the Administrative Agent, upon the Administrative Agent's request, schedules, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, showing the date of issue, account party, amount, expiration date and the reference number of each Letter of Credit issued by it outstanding at any time during such month and the aggregate amount payable by the Borrower during such month. In addition, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender shall furnish to the Administrative Agent copies of any Letter of Credit and any application for or reimbursement agreement with -29-
respect to a Letter of Credit to which such Issuing Lender is party and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent. Upon the request of any Lender, the Administrative Agent will provide to such Lender information concerning such Letters of Credit. 2.20.9 Indemnification; Exoneration. (a) In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere provided in this Section 2.20, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Lender from and against any and all liabilities and costs which the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit other than, in the case of the applicable Issuing Lender, as a result of its Gross Negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) the failure of the applicable Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental Acts"). (b) As among the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of such Letter of Credit by, the beneficiary of any Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the provisions of the Letter of Credit applications and Letter of Credit reimbursement agreements executed by the Borrower at the time of request for any Letter of Credit, neither the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender nor any Lender shall be responsible (in the absence of Gross Negligence or willful misconduct in connection therewith, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction): (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of the Letters of Credit that appears on its face to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument that appears on its face to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Letter of Credit transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply duly with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex, or other similar form of teletransmission or otherwise; (v) for errors in interpretation of technical trade terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; and (viii) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders, including, without limitation, any Governmental Acts. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any Issuing Lender's rights or powers under this Section 2.20.9. (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in -30-
connection with the Letters of Credit or any related certificates shall not, in the absence of Gross Negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, put the applicable Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any resulting liability to the Borrower or relieve the Borrower of any of its obligations hereunder to any such Person. (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.20 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the termination of this Agreement. 2.20.10 Cash Collateral. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any application for a Letter of Credit, after the occurrence and during the continuance of Default, the Borrower shall, upon the Administrative Agent's demand, deliver to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, cash, or other collateral of a type satisfactory to the Required Lenders, having a value, as determined by such Lenders, equal to the aggregate outstanding L/C Obligations. In addition, if the available Aggregate Commitment is at any time less than the amount of L/C Obligations outstanding at any time, the Borrower shall deposit cash collateral with the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount by which such L/C Obligations exceed such available Aggregate Commitment. Any such collateral shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a separate interest-bearing account appropriately designated as a cash collateral account in relation to this Agreement and the Letters of Credit and retained by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders as collateral security for the Borrower's obligations in respect of this Agreement and each of the Letters of Credit and L/C Drafts. Such amounts shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Lenders for drawings or payments under or pursuant to Letters of Credit or L/C Drafts, or if no such reimbursement is required, to payment of such of the other Obligations as the Administrative Agent shall determine, in each case without further authorization from the Borrower; provided, however, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of such application. If no Default shall be continuing, amounts remaining in any cash collateral account established pursuant to this Section 2.20.10 which are not to be applied to reimburse an Issuing Lender for amounts actually paid or to be paid by such Issuing Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit or L/C Draft, shall be returned to the Borrower (after deduction of the Administrative Agent's expenses incurred in connection with such cash collateral account). 2.21 Pricing. The Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate for any period shall be determined on the basis of the publicly announced ratings ("Credit Ratings") by Moody's and S&P on the Borrower's Rated Debt during such period, in each case in accordance with the table set forth below, to change when and as such Credit Ratings change. For purposes of determining the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate with respect to any period: (i) Any change in the Credit Rating shall be deemed to become effective on the date of public announcement thereof and shall remain in effect until the date of public announcement that such Credit Rating shall no longer be in effect. If any change -31-
in Credit Rating occurs during an Interest Period, the new Eurodollar Applicable Margin, Applicable Facility Fee Rate and Applicable Utilization Fee Rate shall become effective from the date of the public announcement. (ii) If, during any period, either Moody's or S&P shall not have a publicly-announced Credit Rating with respect to the Borrower's Rated Debt, the Credit Rating announced by the other rating agency with respect thereto shall be used. (iii) Except as provided below, in the event that the Credit Ratings publicly announced by Moody's and S&P with respect to the Borrower's Rated Debt appear in more than one column of the table, the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate will be based on the column which includes the highest rating; provided, however, that if there exists a differential of two or more levels between the Credit Rating publicly announced by Moody's and the Credit Rating publicly announced by S & P, then the Credit Rating which is one level below the higher announced Credit Rating will determine the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate. (iv) If, during any period, neither Moody's nor S&P shall have publicly announced a Credit Rating with respect to the Borrower's Rated Debt, the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate and the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate shall be the margins set forth under the column entitled "No Other Pricing Level Applies."

ARTICLE III CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES 3.1 Yield Protection. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, or the compliance by any Lender therewith, (a) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from payments due from the Borrower (excluding federal taxation of the overall net income of any Lender, franchise taxes and branch profit taxes), or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in respect of its Loans, L/C Interests or other amounts due it hereunder, or (b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or (c) imposes any other condition, in each case, the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with Loans or Letters of Credit, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Loans or Letters of Credit held, or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or reduction in an amount received which such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to making, funding and maintaining its Loans, its L/C Interests, the Letters of Credit and its Commitment. 3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines that the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation -33-
controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below in this Section 3.2), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans, its L/C Interests, the Letters of Credit or its obligation to make Loans or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's or such controlling corporation's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (a) any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines (as defined below in this Section 3.2) or (b) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (a) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement, including transition rules, and (b) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any circumstances that would cause the Borrower to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.2, provided that, except as set forth in Section 3.5(b), the failure to give such notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligation to pay such additional amounts hereunder. 3.3 Availability of Types of Syndicated Advances. If any Lender reasonably determines that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders reasonably determine that (a) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not available or (b) the interest rate applicable to a Type of Syndicated Advance does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining such Syndicated Advance, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of Syndicated Advance. 3.4 Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment, conversion or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not made (whether by borrowing, continuation or conversion) on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, or an optional prepayment, notice of which has been given in accordance with Section 2.5, is not made on the date specified therefor in such notice, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the Eurodollar Advance. -34-
3.5 Mitigation; Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. (a) To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the unavailability of a Type of Syndicated Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender in its reasonable determination. If the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Advances has been suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 as a consequence of a determination by any Lender that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law or any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 3.1 or 3.2, the Borrower may elect (i) subject to Section 3.4, to prepay any outstanding Syndicated Advances to the extent necessary to mitigate its liability under Section 3.1 or 3.2, or (ii) to require the applicable Lender to assign its outstanding Syndicated Loans, L/C Interests and Commitment hereunder to another financial institution designated by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The obligation of a Lender to assign its rights and obligations hereunder as contemplated by this Section 3.5(a) is subject to the requirements that (x) all amounts owing to that Lender under the Loan Documents are paid in full upon the completion of such assignment and (y) any assignment is effected in accordance with the terms of Section 12.3 and on terms otherwise satisfactory to that Lender (it being understood that the Borrower or the replacement Lender shall pay the processing fee payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.3.2 in connection with any such assignment). (b) In determining the amounts payable under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4, each Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to make its allocations and computations, to the extent readily determinable, consistent with the allocations and computations applied generally by such Lender to other customers of similar size and credit quality and under similar circumstances. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Borrower of the written statement. The Borrower shall not be liable for any amounts under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4 accruing more than 120 days prior to the receipt of a demand for payment therefor. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. ARTICLE IV CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 4.1 Effectiveness; Initial Syndicated Advance. This Agreement shall become effective and the Lenders shall be obligated to make the initial Syndicated Advance or Swing Line Loan only after the Administrative Agent shall have received from the Borrower, with sufficient copies (other than in the case of any requested Notes) for each of the Lenders, each of the following items in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent: -35-
(a) a copy of the certificate of incorporation (or comparable constitutive document) of the Borrower, together with all amendments thereto and a certificate of good standing, certified by the appropriate governmental officer of its jurisdiction of organization and by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or other appropriate officer of the Borrower; (b) copies, certified by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Borrower of its by-laws (or any comparable constitutive laws, rules or regulations) and of its board of directors' resolutions (and resolutions of other bodies, if any are deemed necessary by counsel for any Lender) authorizing the execution of the Loan Documents; (c) incumbency certificates, executed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Borrower, which shall identify by name and title and bear the signature of the officers of the Borrower authorized to sign the Loan Documents and to make borrowings hereunder, as applicable, upon which certificate the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely until informed of any change in writing by the Borrower; (d) a certificate, signed by the Chief Financial Officer, stating that on the date hereof no Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing; (e) evidence of the payment of all fees required to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to the Fee Letters; (f) opinions of (i) Ropes & Gray LLP, counsel to the Borrower, and (ii) a Senior Vice President-Legal of the Borrower, substantially in the forms attached as Exhibit B hereto; (g) evidence of delivery of the 4-Year Revolving Credit Agreement by each of the parties thereto; (h) written money transfer instructions, in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto, addressed to the Administrative Agent and signed by an Authorized Officer, together with such other related money transfer authorizations as the Administrative Agent may have reasonably requested; (i) evidence of the termination of the Existing Credit Agreements and repayment of in full of all obligations, indebtedness and liabilities outstanding thereunder from the proceeds of the initial Loans hereunder and/or the initial "Loans" under and as defined in the 4-Year Revolving Credit Agreement; and (j) such other documents as any Lender or its counsel may have reasonably requested (including, without limitation, any Notes requested pursuant to Section 2.14(a)(iv)). 4.2 Each Syndicated Advance and Letter of Credit. No Lender shall be required to make any Loan, nor shall any Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder, unless on the applicable Borrowing Date or date for issuance of such Letter of Credit: -36-
(a) there exists no Default or Unmatured Default; (b) the representations and warranties contained in Article V are true and correct as of such Borrowing Date or date for issuance of such Letter of Credit (other than the representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.5, which shall only be made by the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement) except to the extent any such representation or warranty is stated to relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct on and as of such earlier date; (c) after giving effect to such Loan and the other Loans being made as a part of such Syndicated Advance or the issuance of such Letter of Credit, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Syndicated Advances and outstanding L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans does not exceed the Aggregate Commitment; and (d) all legal matters incident to the making of such Syndicated Advance or the issuance of such Letter of Credit shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders and their counsel.

If any other Default occurs and is continuing (which Default has not been waived under the terms of Section 8.2) the Required Lenders may (a) terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans whereupon the obligation of the Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall also terminate or be suspended, or (b) declare the Obligations to be due and payable, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives, or (c) take the action described in both the preceding clause (a) and the preceding clause (b). If, within 30 days after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7) and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination. 8.2 Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower -54-
may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender affected thereby: (a) extend the maturity of any Loan, Note or Reimbursement Obligation or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount thereof, any interest thereon or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder; (b) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders; (c) except as provided in Section 2.11(d), increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or permit the Borrower to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement; or (d) amend this Section 8.2 or amend or waive any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that specifies the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend or waive any rights or make any determination or grant any consent. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating in any way to the Administrative Agent or any or all of the Letters of Credit shall be effective without the written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender.

No delay or omission of the Lenders or any of them or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by (or with the consent of) the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or afforded by law shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full. -55-

All representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive delivery hereof (including any Notes) and the making of the Loans herein contemplated. 9.2 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation. 9.3 Taxes; Stamp Duties. Any taxes (excluding taxes (including net income taxes, franchise taxes and branch profit taxes) as are imposed on or measured by such Lender's, Swing Line Lender's or Issuing Lender's, as the case may be, net income by the United States of America or any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender, Swing Line Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains its Lending Installation) or other similar assessments or charges made by any Governmental Authority or revenue authority in respect of the Loan Documents shall be paid by the Borrower, together with interest and penalties, if any, as provided in Section 3.1. The Borrower shall pay and forthwith on demand indemnify each of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender, the Swing Line Lender and each Lender against any liability it incurs in respect of any stamp, registration and similar tax which is or becomes payable in connection with the entry into, performance or enforcement of any Loan Document. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Loans or Letters of Credit to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under this Section 9.3, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender in its reasonable determination. If any Lender has demanded compensation under this Section 9.3, the Borrower may elect to require the applicable Lender to assign its outstanding Syndicated Loans, L/C Interests and Commitment hereunder to another financial institution designated by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The obligation of a Lender to assign its rights and obligations hereunder as contemplated by this Section 9.3 is subject to the requirements that (x) all amounts owing to that Lender under the Loan Documents are paid in full upon the completion of such assignment and (y) any assignment is effected in accordance with the terms of Section 12.3 and on terms otherwise satisfactory to that Lender (it being understood that the Borrower or the replacement Lender shall pay the processing fee payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.3.2 in connection with any such assignment). 9.4 Headings.

The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties (and their directors, officers and employees with respect to Section 9.7 to this Agreement) and their respective successors and assigns. 9.7 Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers; which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers or of one outside counsel, but not both) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, review, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders for any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of not more than three firms of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of such persons) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender in connection with the restructuring, workout, collection and/or enforcement of the Loan Documents. (b) The Borrower further agrees to defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender, and each and all of the Issuing Lenders, the Lenders and the Arrangers and each of their respective Affiliates, and each of such Person's respective officers, directors, employees, partners, managers, shareholders, attorneys and agents (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys and paralegals for such Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be designated a party thereto), imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising out of: -57-
(i) this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any act, event or transaction related or attendant thereto or to the making of the Loans, and the issuance or modification of and participation in Letters of Credit hereunder, the management of such Loans or Letters of Credit, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans or Letters of Credit hereunder, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents; or (ii) any liabilities, obligations, responsibilities, losses, damages, personal injury, death, punitive damages, economic damages, consequential damages, treble damages, intentional, willful or wanton injury, damage or threat to the environment, natural resources or public health or welfare, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney, expert and consulting fees and costs of investigation, feasibility or remedial action studies), fines, penalties and monetary sanctions and interest, direct or indirect, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, past, present or future relating to violation of any Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law arising from or in connection with the past, present or future operations of the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors in interest, or, the past, present or future environmental, health or safety condition of any respective Property of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, the presence of asbestos-containing materials at any respective property of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the release or threatened release of any petroleum, toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment (collectively, the "Indemnified Matters"); provided, however, the Borrower shall have no obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder with respect to Indemnified Matters caused solely by or resulting solely from the willful misconduct or Gross Negligence of such Indemnitee as determined by the final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, the Borrower shall contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law, to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Matters incurred by the Indemnitees. (c) The Borrower further agrees to assert no claim against any of the Indemnitees on any theory of liability for consequential, special, indirect, exemplary or punitive damages. No settlement shall be entered into by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any claim, litigation, arbitration or other proceeding relating to or arising out of the transaction evidenced by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other Indemnitee is a party thereto) unless such settlement releases all Indemnitees from any and all liability with respect thereto. After submission of a written request to an Indemnitee from the Borrower detailing the nature of any claim, litigation, arbitration or other proceeding which relates to or arises out of the transaction evidenced by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, such Indemnitee shall inform the Borrower as to whether it will require compliance with the provisions of this clause (c) or whether it will waive such compliance, any waiver of which shall be applicable only for such Indemnitee. (d) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement. -58-

Subject to Section 13.1 hereof, all statements, notices, closing documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent with sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent, if it deems appropriate, may furnish one to each of the Lenders. 9.9 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with GAAP. If any changes in GAAP are hereafter required or permitted and are adopted by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with the agreement of its independent certified public accountants and such changes result in a change in the method of calculation of any of the financial covenants, restrictions or standards herein or in the related definitions or terms used therein ("Accounting Changes"), the parties hereto agree, at the Borrower's request, to enter into negotiations, in good faith, in order to amend such provisions in a credit neutral manner so as to reflect equitably such Accounting Changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' financial condition shall be the same after such Accounting Changes as if such Accounting Changes had not been made; provided, however, until such provisions are amended in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, no Accounting Change shall be given effect in such calculations and all financial statements and reports required to be delivered hereunder shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP without taking into account such Accounting Changes. In the event such amendment is entered into, all references in this Agreement to GAAP shall mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect as of the date of such amendment. 9.10 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable. 9.11 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, on the other hand, shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to review or inform the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any matter in connection with any phase of the business or operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 9.12 GOVERNING LAW.

Each of the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender and Lenders agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for -62-
breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Issuing Lender, Swing Line Lender and Lender waives. 10.2 Powers. The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no implied duties or fiduciary duties to the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender or Lenders, or any obligation to the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender or Lenders to take any action hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents required to be taken by the Administrative Agent. 10.3 General Immunity. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates nor any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower or any Issuing Lender, Swing Line Lender or Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen solely from the Gross Negligence or willful misconduct of such Person. 10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Creditworthiness, Collateral, Recitals, Etc. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any extension of credit hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other obligor under any Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (iv) the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; or (v) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Issuing Lender, Swing Line Lender or Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, legality, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial condition of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent will use its reasonable efforts to distribute to each of the Lenders, in a timely fashion, a copy of all written reports, certificates and information required to be supplied by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; provided that any failure in such regard shall not result in any liability on the part of the Administrative Agent and provided, further that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to the -63-
Administrative Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (either in its capacity as Administrative Agent or in its individual capacity) or any of its Affiliates. 10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders (as applicable under Section 8.2) or under any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender, Lenders and any other holders of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction (which shall not include any requirement that it be indemnified for its willful misconduct or Gross Negligence) by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. 10.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender or Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender and Lenders and all matters pertaining to the Administrative Agent's duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document. 10.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Loan Document, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document (including any electronic transmission) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent or given by the proper person or persons, and, in respect of legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Administrative Agent and which counsel may have acted as counsel for the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 10.8 The Administrative Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender or Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including with -64-
respect to any disagreement between or among any of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender or Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen solely from the Gross Negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. 10.9 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Commitment, Loans made by it, Letters of Credit issued by it and Notes (if any) issued to it, Bank of America (or any other Person succeeding it as the Administrative Agent) shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document as any Lender, Issuing Lender or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender," "Lenders," "Issuing Lender," "Issuing Lenders," "Swing Line Lender," and "Swing Line Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include Bank of America (or any other Person succeeding it as the Administrative Agent) in its individual capacity. Bank of America (or any other Person succeeding it as the Administrative Agent) and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Person is not prohibited hereby from engaging with any other Person. 10.10 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Issuing Lender, Swing Line Lender or Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Issuing Lender, Swing Line Lender or Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 10.11 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, without the consent of the Borrower and on behalf of the Swing Line Lender, Issuing Lenders and Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent -65-
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may appoint, without the consent of the Borrower and on behalf of the Issuing Lenders, Swing Line Lender and Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall be a Lender unless no Lender shall so agree in which event such successor Administrative Agent may be a Person of the Administrative Agent's choosing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, each such successor Administrative Agent shall be subject to approval by the Borrower, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. 10.12 No Duties Imposed on Syndication Agents, Documentation Agents or Arrangers. None of the Persons identified on the cover page to this Agreement, the signature pages to this Agreement or otherwise in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent," "Documentation Agent" or "Arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, if such Person is a Lender, Issuing Lender or Swing Line Lender, those applicable to all Lenders, Issuing Lenders or Swing Line Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Persons identified on the cover page to this Agreement, the signature pages to this Agreement or otherwise in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent," "Documentation Agent" or "Arranger" shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary duty to or fiduciary relationship with any Lender. In addition to the agreement set forth in Section 10.12, each of the Lenders acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. 10.13 Administrative Agent's Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by separate letter agreement, or as otherwise agreed from time to time. -66-
ARTICLE XI SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS 11.1 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default or Unmatured Default occurs and is continuing, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due. 11.2 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Syndicated Loans (other than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Syndicated Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Syndicated Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Syndicated Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made. 11.3 Application of Payments. The Administrative Agent shall, unless otherwise specified at the direction of the Required Lenders which direction shall be consistent with the last sentence of this Section 11.3, apply all payments and prepayments in respect of any Obligations in the following order: (a) first, to pay interest on and then principal of any portion of the Loans which the Administrative Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Lender for which the Administrative Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower; (b) second, to pay Obligations in respect of any fees, expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such; (c) third, to pay interest on and then principal outstanding on the Swing Line Loans, applied ratably to all outstanding Swing Line Loans; (d) fourth, to the ratable payment of Obligations in respect of any fees, expenses, reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders, Swing Line Lender and Issuing Lenders; -67-
(e) fifth, to pay interest due in respect of Loans (other than Swing Line Loans) and L/C Obligations; (f) sixth, to the ratable payment or prepayment of principal outstanding on Loans (other than Swing Line Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine in its sole discretion; (g) seventh, to provide required cash collateral, if any, pursuant to Section 2.20.10; and (h) eighth, to the ratable payment of all other Obligations. Unless otherwise designated (which designation shall only be applicable if no Default has occurred and is continuing) by the Borrower or unless otherwise mandated by the terms of this Agreement, all principal payments in respect of Loans shall be applied first, to repay outstanding Money Market Rate Loans, second to repay other outstanding Floating Rate Loans, and then to repay outstanding Eurodollar Loans with those Eurodollar Loans which have earlier expiring Interest Periods being repaid prior to those which have later expiring Interest Periods. The order of priority set forth in this Section 11.3 and the related provisions of this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuing Lenders as among themselves. The order of priority set forth in clauses (d) through (h) of this Section 11.3 may at any time and from time to time be changed by the Required Lenders without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by Borrower or any other Person. The order of priority set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 11.3 may be changed only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the order of priority set forth in clause (c) may be changed only with the prior written consent of the Swing Line Lender. ARTICLE XII BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS 12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (a) the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the consent of all of the Lenders and (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3. Notwithstanding clause (b) of the preceding sentence, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Administrative Agent. Any assignee or transferee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such transfer or assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions -68-
of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of the rights to such Loan. 12.2 Participations. 12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other Eligible Participants (a "Participant") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any L/C Interest held by such Lender, the Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. The participation agreement effecting the sale of any participating interest shall contain a representation by the Participant to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the participating interest in the Commitment, Loans and L/C Interests under such participation agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Participant in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. 12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan, L/C Interest or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require the consent of such Participant under Section 8.2(a) if such Participant were a Lender. 12.2.3 Benefit of Setoff and Other Provisions. The Borrower agrees that to the extent permitted by law each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be obligated to make any payment with respect to such Sections which is greater than the amount that the Borrower would have paid to the Lender had no such participating interest been sold. -69-
12.3 Assignments. 12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or more commercial banks ("Purchasers") all or any part of its Commitment and outstanding Loans and L/C Interests, together with its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents with respect thereto; provided, however, that the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of such assignment) may be in the amount of such Lender's entire Commitment but otherwise shall not be less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuing Lenders shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective (none of which consents may be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required. 12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the Administrative Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached to Exhibit D hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (b) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto and thereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if the transferor Lender desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and, if the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting its Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment. 12.4 Designated Lenders. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12.4(a), any Lender may from time to time elect to designate an Eligible Designee to provide all or any part of the Loans to be made by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement; provided the designation of an Eligible Designee by any Lender for purposes of this Section 12.4(a) shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower (so long as no Default has occurred and its continuing) and the -70-
Administrative Agent (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Upon the execution by the parties to each such designation of an agreement in the form of Exhibit I hereto (a "Designation Agreement") and the acceptance thereof by the Borrower (if required) and the Administrative Agent, the Eligible Designee shall become a Designated Lender for purposes of this Agreement. The Designating Lender shall thereafter have the right to permit the Designated Lender to provide all or a portion of the Loans to be made by the Designating Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the making of such Loans or portion thereof shall satisfy the obligation of the Designating Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan was made by the Designating Lender. As to any Loan made by it, each Designated Lender shall have all the rights a Lender making such Loan would have under this Agreement and otherwise; provided, (x) that all voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by the Designating Lender and (y) each Designating Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for its obligations under this Agreement, including the obligations of a Lender in respect of Loans made by its Designated Lender. If the Designating Lender's Loans are evidenced by Notes, no additional Notes shall be required with respect to Loans provided by a Designated Lender; provided, however, to the extent any Designated Lender shall advance funds, the Designating Lender shall be deemed to hold any Notes in its possession as an agent for such Designated Lender to the extent of the Loan funded by such Designated Lender. Such Designating Lender shall act as administrative agent for its Designated Lender and give and receive notices and communications hereunder. Any payments for the account of any Designated Lender shall be paid to its Designating Lender as administrative agent for such Designated Lender and neither the Borrower nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for any Designating Lender's application of any such payments. In addition, any Designated Lender may (i) with notice to, but without the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, assign all or portions of its interests in any Loans to its Designating Lender or to any financial institution consented to by the Borrower (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) and the Administrative Agent providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such Designated Lender and (ii) subject to advising any such Person that such information is to be treated as confidential in accordance with such Person's customary practices for dealing with confidential, non-public information, disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any guarantee, surety or credit or liquidity enhancement to such Designated Lender. (b) Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that it shall not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against any Designated Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangements, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law for one year and a day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any Designated Lender; provided that the Designating Lender for each Designated Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage and expense arising out of their inability to institute any such proceeding against such Designated Lender. This Section 12.4(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 12.5 Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a -71-
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.14 of this Agreement. 12.6 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 2.18. ARTICLE XIII NOTICES 13.1 Giving Notice. (a) Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.14(b) with respect to telephonic notices or as elsewhere provided herein, all notices and other communications provided to any party hereto under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in writing or by telex or by facsimile and addressed or delivered to such party at its address set forth below its signature hereto or at such other address as may be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties. Any notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage prepaid, shall be deemed given when received; any notice, if transmitted by telex or facsimile, shall be deemed given when transmitted (answerback confirmed in the case of telexes). (b) The Borrower hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may make available to the Lenders materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder, including, but not limited to, any documents furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 6.1 (collectively, "Borrower Materials") by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks or another similar electronic system (the "Platform"). The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked "PUBLIC" as being suitable only for posting on the portion of the Platform not designated "Public Investor". The Borrower acknowledges that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents (collectively, the "Agent Parties") have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, -72-
liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower's or the Administrative Agent's transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final judgment to have resulted from the Gross Negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Borrower Materials have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Borrower Materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender's e-mail address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address. 13.2 Change of Address. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto. ARTICLE XIV COUNTERPARTS This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. Subject to Section 4.1, this Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Administrative Agent by telex or telephone that it has taken such action. ARTICLE XV USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Patriot Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.
