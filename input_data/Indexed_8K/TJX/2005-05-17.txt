Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2006 Results FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2005--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the first quarter ended April 30, 2005. Net sales for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, a 9% increase over last year. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 3% over last year's strong 8% increase. Net income was $149 million and diluted earnings per share were $.30 versus $.32 in the prior year. Edmond English, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., commented, "We knew the first quarter would be challenging, since we were up against our most difficult comparisons of the year, given last year's extremely strong comparable store sales and margin performance. This challenge was further compounded by unseasonable weather that prevailed across several major trading areas, resulting in first quarter sales and earnings coming in slightly below our expectations. That said, I am encouraged by several aspects of our business. First, in regions with warm weather, our business was very strong, which bodes well for the balance of the season. Second, inventory and expense management has been strong. Open-to-buy positions are more liquid than last year across virtually all our businesses, allowing us to capitalize upon the abundant buying opportunities in the market. Finally, I am encouraged by the progress we are seeing at some of our younger businesses, and the specific actions we have taken to improve their profitability and earnings growth. "At The Marmaxx Group, the combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, first quarter top-line results were in line with our expectations, with sales increasing 6% and comparable store sales increasing 3%. Segment profit was $268 million and segment profit margin was 10.4%, both less than we had planned, but against exceptionally strong profit performance last year when merchandise margins reached the highest levels for the first quarter in the history of The Marmaxx Group. Following a very strong February, sales weakened in March due to difficult weather patterns, and we took aggressive markdowns to keep our stores fresh. We are encouraged by robust sales in regions where the weather was seasonable, especially on the West Coast and in Florida. We also are pleased with continued strength in women's sportswear and our expanded jewelry/accessories and footwear departments, as well as improving trends in our men's and children's categories." English continued, "At our Canadian concepts, Winners and HomeSense, first quarter sales increased 16% and comparable store sales increased 7% above last year in U.S. dollars. In local currency, which we believe more meaningfully reflects our operating performance, comparable store sales decreased 1%, versus a strong 6% increase last year. Winners' segment profit for the quarter was $12 million, which was below our expectations. With unusually harsh weather in Canada, Winners took aggressive markdowns to keep its stores current. I am very pleased with the inventory discipline at Winners. As we enter the second quarter, total inventories per store are well below last year's levels, the open-to-buy position is in great shape, and we are in an excellent position to continue flowing fresh apparel and home fashions to our stores. "At HomeGoods, sales in the first quarter increased 14% and comparable store sales were flat versus a 4% increase last year. Segment profit was $1 million, slightly below our plan. We are encouraged that comparable store sales trends improved as we moved through the quarter. As we enter the summer selling season, we are seeing positive customer response to our merchandise mix and great values on exciting home fashions. "At T.K. Maxx, in the U.K. and Ireland, first quarter sales increased 21% and comparable store sales increased 2% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, comparable store sales decreased 1% against last year's solid 5% gain. While T.K. Maxx was adversely impacted by the ongoing difficult retail environment in the U.K., with profit below plan, they did a good job of limiting their margin exposure through disciplined inventory and expense management. In particular, I am very pleased that T.K. Maxx actually increased its gross profit margin by buying close to need and limiting markdowns." English continued, "A.J. Wright's first quarter sales increased 26% over last year and comparable store sales increased 1% versus last year's very strong 9% increase. Bottom-line results were flat with last year and in line with our expectations. As A.J. Wright's store base is heavily concentrated in the Northeast, the cold weather in March and April had a significant impact on this division. Despite softer sales, A.J. Wright did an excellent job of managing inventories throughout the quarter. As we begin the second quarter, A.J. Wright has solid opportunities to improve year-over-year performance. "Bob's Stores' first quarter sales were slightly less than we had anticipated. However, bottom-line results were in line with plan, and we are pleased with the improvements we are seeing in merchandise margins." English continued, "We continue to generate significant returns on investment, which gives us the ability to grow our businesses while simultaneously pursuing our sizable share repurchase program and maintaining our strong financial position. During the first quarter, we spent a total of $263 million, which was more than we had planned, retiring 11 million shares of TJX stock." English concluded, "As we enter the second quarter, I am encouraged by our business prospects. Our stores look great across all of our divisions. Business was strong in regions where weather was favorable. Our open-to-buy position is in even better shape than at this time last year, giving us the continued ability to navigate through the marketplace and take advantage of the many opportunities to offer our customers excellent values on fresh, summer fashions."

Notes To Consolidated and Consolidated Subsidiaries Condensed Financial Statements 1. In our fourth quarter reporting period ended January 29, 2005, we began to calculate diluted earnings per share in accordance with EITF Issue No. 04-08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share." This accounting pronouncement impacts the company's treatment for earnings per share purposes, of its $517.5 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes issued in February 2001. These notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale price of our stock reaches certain levels or other contingencies are met. EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that shares associated with contingently convertible debt be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether contingent conversion conditions have been met. EITF Issue No. 04-08 also requires that diluted earnings per share for all prior periods be restated to reflect this change. As a result, diluted earnings per share reflect the assumed conversion of our convertible subordinated notes. This change reduces first quarter diluted earnings per share by $.01 per share for both the current and prior first quarter reporting period. 2. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory purchase obligations at the time the inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. As a result, as of April 30, 2005 we have recorded a $179.6 million increase to merchandise inventory on our balance sheet, to reflect this in-transit inventory, as well as an equal increase to accounts payable at that date. Prior years have not been adjusted for this change. This accrual for inventory in transit affects only the reported levels of inventory and accounts payable on the balance sheet, and has no impact on our operating results, cash flows, liquidity or shareholders' equity. 3. During the first quarter ended April 30, 2005, TJX repurchased 11.0 million shares of its common stock, for a cost of $262.9 million. Through April 30, 2005, under its current $1 billion multi-year stock repurchase program, TJX has repurchased 28.7 million shares at a cost of $669.4 million. CONTACT: The TJX Companies, Inc.
