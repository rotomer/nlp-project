Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2006 Results FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 16, 2005--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the second quarter ended July 30, 2005. Net sales for the second quarter were $3.6 billion, a 7% increase over last year, with consolidated comparable store sales increasing 1% over the prior year. Net income was $123 million and diluted earnings per share were $.25, a 9% increase over $.23 in the prior year. For the first half of fiscal 2006, net sales were $7.3 billion, an 8% increase over last year, and year-to-date consolidated comparable store sales increased 2% over the prior year. Net income was $272 million and diluted earnings per share were $.55, versus $.56 in the prior year. Edmond English, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., commented, "Second quarter earnings were less than we had originally planned, primarily due to comparable store sales growth that did not meet our expectations. That said, merchandise margins increased significantly over last year across all divisions, the result of effectively executing our inventory management and close-to-need buying strategies. Also, expenses were well managed. As we enter the back half of the year, we are focused on improving comparable store sales, and believe we have solid opportunities across our businesses. Our inventory position is very liquid, which allows us to continue to buy smarter, generate strong merchandise margins, and offer customers a constant flow of fresh fashions at great values. "At The Marmaxx Group, the combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, second quarter sales increased 4% over last year and comparable store sales increased 2%. Segment profit was up over last year, in line with plan, and segment profit margin also met our expectations. We are on track to net a total of 47 new stores for The Marmaxx Group this year." English continued, "At our Canadian concepts, Winners and HomeSense, second quarter sales increased 8% and comparable store sales decreased 1% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, which we believe more meaningfully reflects our operating performance, comparable store sales decreased 9%, versus a very strong 11% increase last year. Winners' segment profit was essentially flat to last year. We are on track to net 4 new Winners stores and add 17 HomeSense stores in 2005. "At HomeGoods, sales in the second quarter increased 17% and comparable store sales were flat with last year. Bottom-line results were below last year. We now expect to net 37 new HomeGoods stores this year. "At T.K. Maxx, in the U.K. and Ireland, second quarter sales increased 19% and comparable store sales increased 1% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, comparable store sales increased 2% above last year, with an improving trend as we moved through the quarter. Segment profit was up 10% over last year. We now expect to net 27 new T.K. Maxx stores this year." English continued, "A.J. Wright's second quarter sales increased 25% over last year and comparable store sales increased 1% over the prior year. Bottom-line results improved over last year, and we now expect to net 24 new A.J. Wright stores in 2005. "While Bob's Stores' second quarter results were slightly below last year, we are seeing strong merchandise margin growth at this young division. We now expect to end 2005 with a net of 4 new stores at the Bob's Stores chain." English concluded, "We continue to generate significant returns on investment, which gives us the ability to grow our businesses while simultaneously pursuing our sizable share repurchase program and maintaining our strong financial position. During the second quarter, we spent a total of $127 million, retiring 5.5 million shares of TJX stock. Year-to-date, we have spent a total of $390 million in repurchases of TJX stock and have retired a total of 16.4 million shares."

Notes To Consolidated and Consolidated Subsidiaries Condensed Financial Statements 1. In our fourth quarter reporting period ended January 29, 2005, we began to calculate diluted earnings per share in accordance with EITF Issue No. 04-08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share." This accounting pronouncement impacts the company's treatment for earnings per share purposes, of its $517.5 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes issued in February 2001. These notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale price of our stock reaches certain levels or other contingencies are met. EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that shares associated with contingently convertible debt be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether contingent conversion conditions have been met. EITF Issue No. 04-08 also requires that diluted earnings per share for all prior periods be restated to reflect this change. As a result, diluted earnings per share reflect the assumed conversion of our convertible subordinated notes. This change reduces diluted earnings per share by $.01 per share for the second quarters ended July 30, 2005 and July 31, 2004 and by $.02 and $.01 for the six months ended July 30, 2005 and July 31, 2004, respectively. 2. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory purchase obligations at the time the inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. As a result, as of July 30, 2005 we have recorded a $326 million increase to merchandise inventory on our balance sheet, to reflect this in-transit inventory, as well as an equal increase to accounts payable at that date. Prior years have not been adjusted for this change. This accrual for inventory in transit affects only the reported levels of inventory and accounts payable on the balance sheet, and has no impact on our operating results, cash flows, liquidity or shareholders' equity. 3. During the six months ended July 30, 2005, TJX repurchased 16.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $389.7 million. During the second quarter ended July 30, 2005, TJX repurchased 5.5 million shares of its common stock, at a cost of $126.9 million. Through July 30, 2005, under its current $1 billion multi-year stock repurchase program, TJX has repurchased 34.1 million shares at a cost of $796.3 million. CONTACT: The TJX Companies, Inc.
