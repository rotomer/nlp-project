Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2006 Results FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2005--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 29, 2005. Net sales for the third quarter were $4.0 billion, a 6% increase over last year and consolidated comparable store sales were flat versus last year. Net income was $171 million and diluted earnings per share were $.36, compared with $.40 per share in the prior year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2006, net sales were $11.3 billion, a 7% increase over last year, and year-to-date consolidated comparable store sales increased 1% over the prior year. Net income was $444 million and diluted earnings per share were $.91, versus $.95 per share in the prior year. Results for the third quarter and year-to-date periods include a one-time gain of approximately $9 million pre-tax, or $.01 per share, from the Company's portion of the recent Visa/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement. Additionally, results for both periods reflect the negative impact of one-time items previously disclosed: approximately $.01 per share related to the recent hurricanes (detailed below); exit costs and operating losses of approximately $.015 per share associated with the Company's e-commerce business, and; costs of $.01 per share associated with the resignation agreement between TJX and its former CEO. Ben Cammarata, Chairman and Acting Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, "We were disappointed with our sales and earnings results in the third quarter, particularly with the performance of women's sportswear across all divisions. While business was hurt by unseasonably warm weather across much of the U.S., Canada and the U.K., we believe that there are areas of our off-price buying strategies in which better execution would benefit us. That said, we maintained healthy merchandise margins during the quarter, through disciplined inventory management, and expenses were well controlled. As we enter the holiday selling season, we remain focused on profitably growing sales across all of our businesses." Sales by Business Segment The Company's comparable store sales and net sales by division, in the third quarter, were as follows: Third Quarter Third Quarter Comparable Store Sales Net Sales ($ in millions) ---------------------------------- ----------------------- FY2006 FY2005 FY2006 FY2005 - ----------- ----------------- ---------------- ----------- ----------- Marmaxx(a) 0% +2% $2,728 $2,672 - ----------- ----------------- ---------------- ----------- ----------- Winners/ +4%(US$) +10%(US$) $398 $351 HomeSense -4%(C$) +4%(C$) - ----------- ----------------- ---------------- ----------- ----------- T.K.

Wright +2% +3% $159 $129 - ----------- ----------------- ---------------- ----------- ----------- Bob's NA NA $80 $81 Stores - ----------- ----------------- ---------------- ----------- ----------- - ----------- ----------------- ---------------- ----------- ----------- TJX 0% +4% $4,042 $3,817 - ----------- ----------------- ---------------- ----------- ----------- (a) Combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls Margins During the third quarter, the Company's gross margin rate was 24.2% of sales and the selling, general and administrative expenses rate was 17.0%. Both of these rates were unfavorable compared with last year, due to the de-levering effect of flat comparable store sales, combined with the negative impact of the one-time items mentioned above. However, despite softer comparable store sales, merchandise margins in the third quarter were up slightly over last year. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses on a dollar basis were favorable to the Company's plan. The Company's pre-tax income was 6.9% of sales, down compared to the third quarter of last year. Inventory Total inventories as of October 29, 2005, were $2.9 billion compared with $2.8 billion at the same time last year. Consolidated inventories, on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were down 6% from the prior year. At the Marmaxx division, average per store inventories, including the warehouses, were essentially in line with last year's levels. Including merchandise on order, Marmaxx's total inventory commitment was down on a per-store basis. Share Repurchases During the third quarter, the Company spent a total of $125 million, retiring 5.8 million shares of TJX stock. Year-to-date, the Company has spent a total of $515 million in repurchases of TJX stock and has retired a total of 22.2 million shares. As previously announced, during the third quarter, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. At current prices, this would represent approximately 10% of the Company's outstanding common shares. It remains the Company's plan to repurchase a total of $600 million of TJX stock in fiscal 2006. Impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma The Company's third quarter results were negatively impacted by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Combined, these hurricanes negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $.01, including lost sales, the self-insured portion of property damage, and costs incurred to assist the Company's employees. As a result of the hurricanes, a total of 130 stores were closed for various periods of time during the third quarter. 2005 Outlook For the fourth quarter, the Company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $.41 to $.43 with a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2% both on a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Based on its fourth quarter guidance, the Company now expects earnings per share for the full fiscal 2006 year to be in the range of $ 1.32 to $ 1.34. This estimate does not reflect the impact of expensing stock options, which the Company is required to implement in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Stores by Concept During the quarter, the Company netted a total of 89 stores. Year-to-date, the Company has netted 147 stores. As of the end of the quarter, the Company had increased square footage by 9% over the same period, last year.

Notes To Consolidated and Consolidated Subsidiaries Condensed Financial Statements 1. In our fourth quarter reporting period ended January 29, 2005, we began to calculate diluted earnings per share in accordance with EITF Issue No. 04-08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share." This accounting pronouncement impacts the company's treatment for earnings per share purposes, of its $517.5 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes issued in February 2001. These notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale price of our stock reaches certain levels or other contingencies are met. EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that shares associated with contingently convertible debt be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether contingent conversion conditions have been met. EITF Issue No. 04-08 also requires that diluted earnings per share for all prior periods be restated to reflect this change. As a result, diluted earnings per share reflect the assumed conversion of our convertible subordinated notes. This change reduces diluted earnings per share by $.01 per share for the third quarters ended October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004 and by $.02 and $.03 for the nine months ended October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, respectively. 2. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory purchase obligations at the time the inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. As a result, at October 29, 2005 and at October 30, 2004 we recorded increases of $293 million and $202 million, respectively, to merchandise inventory on our balance sheet, to reflect this in-transit inventory, as well as an equal increase to accounts payable at those dates. Periods prior to October, 2004 have not been adjusted for this change. This accrual for inventory in transit affects only the reported levels of inventory and accounts payable on the balance sheet, and has no impact on our operating results, cash flows, liquidity or shareholders' equity. 3. During the nine months ended October 29, 2005, TJX repurchased 22.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $514.7 million. During the third quarter ended October 29, 2005, TJX repurchased 5.8 million shares of its common stock, at a cost of $125.0 million. Through October 29, 2005, under its current $1 billion multi-year stock repurchase program, TJX has repurchased 39.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $921.3 million. In October, 2005, TJX announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new multi-year program for the repurchase of an additional $1 billion of TJX common stock. CONTACT: The TJX Companies, Inc.
