ITEM 1.01      ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
     On December 6, 2005, the Board of Directors of The TJX Companies, Inc., or TJX, adopted the following compensation arrangements for non-employee directors beginning in the fiscal year ending in 2007:
The Executive Committee is excluded from the above committee-specific compensation. Directors may participate in TJX's General Deferred Compensation Plan. TJX does not provide retirement benefits or insurance for non-employee directors. The Stock Incentive Plan was amended to eliminate the annual director option grant and to provide for the deferred share grants described above.
The Lead Director will receive a one-time payment of $35,000, payable February 1, 2006 in recognition of his services in connection with the CEO transition.
The Corporate Governance Principles were amended to provide that each non-employee director's equity ownership should grow over five years to, and be maintained at, a minimum of $200,000 (including shares owned directly and vested deferred shares but excluding unexercised options).
