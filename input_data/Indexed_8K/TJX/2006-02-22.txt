Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports Full Fiscal Year 2006 Results; Fourth Quarter Earnings Above Plan FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 22, 2006--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006. Net sales for the fiscal year were $16.1 billion, an 8% increase over last year and consolidated comparable store sales increased 2%. As previously announced, the Company has adopted the new stock compensation accounting standard as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Accordingly, all results for current and prior periods now reflect the impact of stock option expense (see below). Net income for the 52-week fiscal year was $690 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.41 compared to $1.21 for the prior year. Results for both years were impacted by certain one-time items, which are described further below. Excluding these one-time items, pro forma full-year diluted earnings per share were $1.29 versus $1.25 last year. For the 13-week fiscal 2006 fourth quarter, sales increased 9% to $4.7 billion. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 3% over last year. For the fourth quarter, net income was $289 million, and diluted earnings per share were $.60 compared to $.33 in the prior year. Excluding one-time items, pro forma diluted earnings per share were $.46, an above-plan 24% increase over last year's $.37 in earnings per share. A table reconciling reported results to pro forma results is provided below. Ben Cammarata, Chairman and Acting Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, "Through improved execution and a renewed focus on off-price disciplines, we brought 2005 to a very strong finish, with fourth quarter earnings results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The fourth quarter comparable store sales increase of 3% was achieved on top of a healthy increase last year, with merchandise margins that improved over the prior year despite a challenging competitive environment. During the quarter, we solidly executed our off-price concept by maintaining liquid inventories, making the right buys, and flowing great product at great values to our stores throughout the quarter. Additionally, we were effective in our marketing and managed expenses well. As we begin a new year, driving profitable sales growth continues to be our top priority. Inventories are in excellent shape and we remain extremely focused on executing all aspects of our business." Sales by Business Segment The Company's comparable store sales and net sales by division in the fourth quarter were as follows: Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Comparable Store Sales Net Sales ($ in millions) ------------------------ ------------------------- FY2006 FY2005 FY2006 FY2005 - ----------------- ---------- ------------ ----------- --------- Marmaxx(a) +4% +4% $3,128 $2,954 - ----------------- ---------- ------------ ----------- --------- Winners/HomeSense +5% (US$) +4% (US$) $430 $372 +2% (C$) -4% (C$) - ----------------- ---------- ------------ ----------- --------- T.K.

Maxx and Marshalls Early Adoption of Stock Option Expensing The TJX Companies previously announced its early adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, relating to accounting for stock based compensation, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006. All financial information attached to or discussed in this press release includes stock option expense, which reduced earnings per share by $.03 in the fourth quarter and by $.12 for the full fiscal 2006 year. The Company has elected the modified retrospective transition method. Accordingly, prior period financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the effect of stock option expense on a consolidated basis, as previously disclosed in the pro forma footnote to the TJX financial statements. Additionally, segment data have been adjusted to reflect the related stock option expense for all periods presented. Impact of One-Time Items Results for the fourth quarter and full year of Fiscal 2006 include a previously announced one-time tax benefit of $47 million, or $.10 per share, resulting from the Company's repatriation of accumulated earnings from its foreign operations. Fiscal 2006 results also reflect the impact of certain previously announced, one-time third quarter events (described further in the Company's SEC Form 10-Q for the period ended October 28, 2005), which reduced earnings per share by a net of $.02. In addition, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, TJX's tax provision and net income were favorably impacted by $22 million, or $.04 per share, relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. This liability related to foreign exchange gains on a loan to one of its foreign subsidiaries, which are not taxable under U.S. tax regulations. Finally, results for the fourth quarter and full year of Fiscal 2005 include a one-time, non-cash charge related to lease accounting which reduced earnings per share by $.04. The following table reconciles reported EPS to pro forma EPS (excluding one-time items):(b) Fourth Quarter Full Year FY2006 FY2005 FY2006 FY2005 ------ ------ ------ ------ EPS as reported $0.60 $0.33 $1.41 $1.21 One-time items: Cumulative lease accounting charge - $0.04 - $0.04 Correction to deferred tax liability ($0.04) - ($0.04) - Repatriation tax benefit ($0.10) - ($0.10) - Third quarter events - - $0.02 - ------ ----- ------ ----- Pro forma EPS $0.46 $0.37 $1.29 $1.25 ===== ===== ===== ===== (b) Stock option expense included for all periods Margins During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company's pretax profit margin improved to 7.5%. The gross profit margin increased 1.0 percentage point to 23.1%, representing improved merchandise margins as well as the impact of the one-time lease accounting charge on last year's ratios, which accounts for 0.7 percentage points of this increase. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales improved 0.4 percentage points to 15.5%, primarily due to leverage from general, administrative and store operations costs. For the full year fiscal 2006, consolidated pretax profit margin was 6.3%, down compared to the prior year, primarily due to the de-levering effect of low single digit comparable store sales on expense ratios. Inventory Total inventories as of January 28, 2006, were $2.4 billion compared with $2.4 billion at the same time last year. Consolidated inventories, on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were down 11% from the prior year. At the Marmaxx division, average per-store inventories, including the warehouses, were down 10% from last year's levels. Including merchandise on order, Marmaxx's total inventory commitment was down on a per-store basis. Share Repurchases During the fourth quarter, the Company spent a total of $85 million in repurchases of TJX stock, retiring 3.6 million shares. In Fiscal 2006, the Company spent a total of $600 million in stock repurchases, as planned, and retired a total of 25.9 million shares of TJX stock. During the fourth quarter, the Company completed its $1 billion share repurchase program that was initiated in 2004. As previously announced, in October 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. At current prices, this would represent approximately 9% of the Company's outstanding common shares. 2006 Outlook For the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007, the Company expects earnings per share in the range of $1.42 to $1.46, which represents a 10% to 13% increase over the pro forma $1.29 per share earned in Fiscal 2006, excluding one-time items. This is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth in the 2% to 3% range. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company expects earnings per share in the range of $.31 to $.33, versus $.28 per share in the prior year, which is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth in the 2% to 3% range. Stores by Concept During the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, the Company added a total of 157 stores, net of closings, to end the year with 2,381 stores, and increased square footage by 8% over the same period last year. In the fourth quarter, the Company added a net 10 stores.

Notes To Consolidated and Consolidated Subsidiaries Condensed Financial Statements 1. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 The TJX Companies, Inc. elected to early adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation". SFAS No. 123R requires that the cost of equity-based awards be recognized in the financial statements. In addition, TJX elected the modified retrospective transition method which requires that all prior period financial statements be adjusted to the pro forma amounts previously disclosed in the company's notes to its financial statements. Thus the previously reported results for the periods ended January 29, 2005 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of adopting SFAS 123R. TJX filed a Current Form 8-K on February 2, 2006 which announced its early adoption of SFAS 123R and included the effect of the modified retrospective transition method on certain prior periods. The impact of adopting SFAS 123R reduced net income for the periods ended January 28, 2006 by $12.6 million, or $.03 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and $54.5 million, or $.12 per share, for the full fiscal year. The adjustment to the periods ended January 29, 2005 reduced previously reported net income by $12.0 million, or $.02 per share in the fourth quarter and by $54.4 million, or $.09 per share for the full fiscal year. 2. The tax provision for the periods ended January 28, 2006 includes a one-time benefit of $47 million, or $.10 per share, for the repatriation of approximately US$260 million of earnings from its Canadian operations. Recent tax law changes provided a temporary incentive for multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at reduced income tax rates. In addition, during the fourth quarter TJX recorded an additional tax benefit due to the correction of an overstatement of its deferred tax liability. In prior periods TJX provided for income taxes on foreign currency gains or losses associated with intercompany loans with its Canadian subsidiary. The gains and losses associated with these loans are fully hedged and do not impact pre-tax income, however the foreign currency gains or losses on the underlying intercompany debt are not subject to income taxes. The cumulative impact of this correction increased net income by $22 million, or $.04 per share, in the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 28, 2006. 3. In the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005, The TJX Companies recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to conform its accounting policies with generally accepted accounting principles related to the timing of rent expense. This charge resulted in a one-time, cumulative, non-cash adjustment to rent expense of approximately $19 million after-tax, or $.04 per share, in the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005. On a pre-tax basis the amount of this charge is $30.7 million, which has been recorded in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, on the Company's consolidated income statement. Segment profit for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 has also been reduced by this charge. The pro forma segment profit for the fourth quarter and year-to-date periods ended January 29, 2005, excluding this charge are presented below.
