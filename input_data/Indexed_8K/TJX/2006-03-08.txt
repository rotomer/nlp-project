THE TJX COMPANIES, INC. REDUCES HEADQUARTERS STAFF
AND SENIOR EXECUTIVE SALARIES AS PART OF STRATEGY TO DRIVE
PROFITABLE GROWTH
     Framingham, MA  The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) today announced that, as a part of its overall strategy to drive profitable growth, it has reduced its workforce by approximately 250 positions, affecting corporate and divisional offices in Massachusetts, Canada and the United Kingdom; approximately 100 of these positions represent the elimination of open positions that will not be filled. In concert with this move, the Company announced that 12 of its most senior executives, including its Chairman and Acting CEO and its President, have agreed to 10% salary reductions.
     The staff reductions and senior executive salary cuts result in a cost reduction of $18 million on an annualized basis. For fiscal 2007, the Company anticipates a net benefit to pretax income of $8 million, which reflects $15 million in partial year savings from the cost reductions, partially offset by a $7 million one-time charge related to these actions. The charge will be taken in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and consists primarily of severance and outplacement services for affected Associates. The Company is not revising its earnings forecast for fiscal 2007 as these moves were contemplated in its original guidance.
     Ben Cammarata, Chairman and Acting Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. stated, "Operating with a low cost structure has always been key to our ability to offer customers great values. Upon a careful and comprehensive review of our Headquarters operations, we have identified specific areas where we could provide necessary support and services at reduced costs and improved productivity. The decision to eliminate positions, although very difficult to make, reflects one of many measures our Company is taking to reduce costs and grow our business profitably. I offer my sincere thanks to those Associates affected by this action for their hard work and dedication. As we move forward, our Company remains strong and focused on delivering improved top- and bottom-line results."
     The TJX Companies, Inc. is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. The Company operates 799 T.J. Maxx, 715 Marshalls, 251 HomeGoods and 152 A.J. Wright, as well as 35 Bob's Stores, in the United States. In Canada, the Company operates 174 Winners and 58 HomeSense stores, and in Europe 198 T.K. Maxx stores.
