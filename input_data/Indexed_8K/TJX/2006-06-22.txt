ITEM 3.01
Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On June 15, 2006, The TJX Companies, Inc. (the "Company") provided notice to the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") of a technical deficiency with respect to specific disclosure inadvertently omitted from the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended January 28, 2006.
Under Section 303A.12 (a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, the annual corporate governance certification of our chief executive officer ("CEO") to the NYSE must be disclosed in the Company's annual report to stockholders. The Company inadvertently failed to disclose that our CEO had submitted the annual corporate governance certification to the NYSE. The Company is hereby disclosing that on June 28, 2005 our CEO submitted the annual corporate governance certification with the NYSE, which certification was unqualified.
Although the Company does not believe that this deficiency is material, the Company will correct any potential noncompliance with the NYSE continued listing standards by including the required disclosure in this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, the Company has been advised by the NYSE that by including the required disclosure in this Current Report on Form 8-K it has cured this deficiency.
