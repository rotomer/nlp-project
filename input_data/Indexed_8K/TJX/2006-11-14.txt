Exhibit 99.1 The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports Record Third Quarter Results FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2006--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 28, 2006. Net sales for the third quarter were $4.5 billion, an 11% increase over last year, and consolidated comparable store sales increased 6% over last year. Net income for the quarter was $231 million, and diluted earnings per share were $.48, a 50% increase over $.32 per share in the prior year. Last year's third quarter earnings included a one-time gain and one-time items, detailed below, that negatively impacted the quarter by a net $.02 per share. Excluding the $.02 net effect of these items, diluted earnings per share for this year's third quarter represent a 41% increase over last year's adjusted $.34 per share (see reconciliation in table below). For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, net sales were $12.4 billion, a 9% increase over last year, and year-to-date consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over the prior year. Net income was $533 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.12, a 37% increase over $.82 per share in the prior year on a reported basis. Ben Cammarata, Chairman and Acting Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, "Both our substantial third quarter earnings per share increase and our comparable store sales increase of 6% exceeded our expectations. These results represent continued powerful performance and another record quarter for TJX. Results at The Marmaxx Group, our largest division, were above plan and four of our five smaller divisions also posted significant year-over-year bottom-line improvement that exceeded our expectations. We move into the fourth quarter with good momentum and are ready to flow an exciting array of gift-oriented product, at great values, to our stores throughout the holiday season." Sales by Business Segment The Company's comparable store sales and net sales by division, in the third quarter, were as follows: Third Quarter Third Quarter Comparable Store Sales Net Sales ($ in millions) -------------------------- ------------------------- FY2007 FY2006 FY2007 FY2006 - ----------------- ------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ Marmaxx(a) +5% 0% $2,947 $2,728 - ----------------- ------ ------ ----- ------ ------------ ------------ Winners/HomeSense +11% (US$) +4% (US$) $477 $398 +5% (C$) -4% (C$) - ----------------- ------ ------ ----- ------ ------------ ------------ T.K.

Maxx and Marshalls Impact of One-Time Items on Prior Year's (FY06) Third Quarter Last year's third quarter included a one-time gain from the Company's portion of a Visa/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement. Additionally, results for last year's third quarter reflect the negative impact of one-time items related to hurricanes, including estimated lost sales, self-insured portion of property damage, and employee assistance costs, exit costs and operating losses associated with the Company's e-commerce business, and costs associated with executive resignation agreements. The following table reconciles reported prior year third quarter EPS to adjusted EPS (as described above): Third Quarter FY 2006 --------------------- EPS as reported $0.32 Adjusted for: Executive resignation agreements 0.01 E-commerce exit costs and operating losses 0.01 Hurricane-related costs and estimated impact of lost sales 0.01 Gain from VISA/MC antitrust settlement (0.01) --------------------- Adjusted EPS $0.34 ===================== Margins For the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company's pretax profit margin increased to 8.3% from 6.4% last year, which was driven by significant improvement in segment profit margin at Marmaxx, the Company's largest division, as well as improved segment profit margin across all of our smaller businesses. Gross profit margin increased 1.4 percentage points to 25.4%, primarily due to buying and occupancy cost leverage, as well as a 0.6 percentage-point improvement in merchandise margins, which were favorably impacted by lower markdowns on the strong comparable store sales increase. The SG&A rate also improved 0.5 percentage points, due to leverage from an above-plan comparable store sales increase, the Company's continued focus on cost management and the absence of the one-time items in last year's expenses (see detail in table above), which represented a 0.3 percentage-point improvement in this ratio. These improvements in the SG&A rate were partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense during the quarter. Inventory Total inventories as of October 28, 2006, were $3.2 billion compared with $2.9 billion at the same time last year and, on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were up 5% over the prior year. At the Marmaxx division, per-store inventories, including the warehouses, were up 5% from last year's levels. Including merchandise on order, Marmaxx's total inventory commitment was up on a per-store basis. Share Repurchases During the third quarter, the Company spent a total of $70 million to repurchase TJX stock, retiring 2.4 million shares. Year-to-date, the Company has spent a total of $450 million to repurchase TJX stock and has retired a total of 18.3 million shares. It remains the Company's plan to repurchase a total of $650 million of TJX stock in Fiscal 2007. Stock Option Expense Included As previously announced, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company early-adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R related to accounting for stock based compensation and also adjusted prior period financial statements to reflect the impact of stock option expense. Consequently, the attached consolidated financial statements and business segment results include the impact of stock option expense for both current and prior periods. Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2007 Outlook For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, the Company now expects earnings per share in the range of $.48 - $.50. This range is higher than the $.47 - $.49 range that was contemplated in the Company's earnings guidance provided on August 15, 2006, when the Company offered guidance for its third quarter and full fiscal 2007 year. Last year's earnings per share on a reported basis were $.60, which included a non-recurring tax benefit of $.10 per share from repatriation of earnings from foreign operations and $.04 per share for correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. Excluding the $.14 per share benefit from these items, adjusted earnings per share for last year's fourth quarter were $.46. (See Note 4 to financial statements.) This year's estimated fourth quarter earnings per share would represent a 4% to 9% increase over last year's adjusted earnings per share of $.46. This forecast is based on various assumptions, including estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 3% - 4%, which includes a one-point benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates. Unlike many other companies in the retail industry, TJX does not have a 53rd week in its Fiscal 2007 fourth quarter. For the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007, with above-plan earnings per share during the first nine months of the year, the Company now expects earnings per share in the range of $1.59 to $1.61 as compared to $1.41 on a reported basis in the prior year, a 13% to 14% estimated increase. Prior year earnings per share include a net benefit of $.12 per share from one-time items ($.14 from the non-recurring tax benefit and correction of deferred tax liability, partially offset by the $.02 from the third quarter items detailed above). Excluding the $.12 net benefit of these one-time items, the Company's estimated current year earnings per share would be up 23% to 25% over the adjusted $1.29 earnings per share earned in Fiscal 2006. (See Note 4 to financial statements.) This forecast is based on various assumptions, including consolidated comparable store sales growth of 4%, which includes a one-point benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates. Stores by Concept During the third quarter, the Company added a total of 76 stores. TJX increased square footage by 6% over the same period last year.

See Note 1 to consolidated condensed statements. The TJX Companies, Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Condensed Statements 1. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 The TJX Companies, Inc. elected to early adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS No. 123R requires that the cost of equity-based awards be recognized in the financial statements. In addition, TJX elected the modified retrospective transition method which requires that all prior period financial statements be adjusted to the pro forma amounts previously disclosed in the company's notes to its financial statements. Thus the previously reported results for the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2005 have been adjusted to reflect the effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R. 2. We accrue for inventory purchase obligations at the time the inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. As a result, merchandise inventories include an estimate for "inventory-in-transit" of $327.2 million as of October 28, 2006 and $293.1 million as of October 29, 2005. A liability for a comparable amount is included in accounts payable for the respective period. 3. During the nine months ended October 28, 2006, TJX repurchased 18.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $450 million. During the third quarter ended October 28, 2006, TJX repurchased 2.4 million shares of its common stock, at a cost of $70 million. Through October 28, 2006, under its current $1 billion multi-year stock repurchase program, TJX has spent $457 million on the repurchase of 18.5 million shares of TJX common stock. 4. The following is a reconciliation of fiscal 2006's fourth quarter and full year diluted earnings per share, as reported on a GAAP basis, to the adjusted diluted earnings per share referenced in our earnings release under the caption "Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2007 Outlook". Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2006 --------------------------- Fourth Quarter Full Year -------------- ------------ Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 0.60 $ 1.41 Impact of deferred tax liability correction (0.04) (0.04) Repatriation income tax benefit (0.10) (0.10) Third quarter events(b) - 0.02 -------------- ------------ Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 0.46 $ 1.29 ============== ============ (b) The third quarter events include executive resignation agreements, e-commerce exit costs and operating losses, and hurricane related costs including the estimated impact of lost sales, partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement.
