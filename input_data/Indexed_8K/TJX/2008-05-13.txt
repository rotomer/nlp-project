Exhibit 99.1
The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports First Quarter FY09 Results
FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the first quarter ended April 26, 2008. Net sales for the first quarter of Fiscal 2009 increased 6% to $4.4 billion, and consolidated comparable store sales increased 3% over last year. Net income for the first quarter was $194 million, and diluted earnings per share were $.43 compared to $.34 last year. This years first quarter results include a benefit of $12 million, which rounds to $.02 per share, due to certain tax-related adjustments unanticipated at the beginning of the quarter. Prior years first quarter results included an after-tax charge of $12 million, which rounds to $.03 per share, with respect to the computer intrusion(s). Excluding these items, first quarter Fiscal 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $.41 increased 11% over the adjusted $.37 for the prior year.
Carol Meyrowitz, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, We are pleased with our first quarter performance, as we once again drove strong sales, merchandise margins, and profit growth despite the challenges of the consumer environment and unfavorable weather in the first two months. While we continue our sharp execution of our off-price business model and deliver strong results, we are also funding our expansion domestically and internationally. We are excited by our prospects for growth in Europe, having opened our first HomeSense stores in the U.K. and another T.K. Maxx store in Germany. As we move into the second quarter, we are very well positioned to continue to capitalize upon merchandise opportunities and deliver great value to our customers every day.
Sales by Business Segment
The Companys comparable store sales and net sales by division, in the first quarter, were as follows:
Margins
For the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Companys consolidated pretax profit margin was 6.6%. This compares to 6.4% in the prior year, which included the negative impact (0.5 percentage points) of a charge related to the previously announced computer intrusion(s). Excluding the intrusion(s) charge, this years first quarter consolidated pretax profit margin was 0.3 percentage points below the adjusted 6.9% last year and slightly below the Company's plan, due to slightly lower gross profit margin and reduced interest income versus prior year. The gross profit margin for the Fiscal 2009 first quarter was 24.0%, 0.1 percentage points below the prior year, due to investments in growing the Companys European businesses and deleverage from buying and occupancy costs. These costs were mostly offset by improvement in merchandise margins, which were achieved despite higher fuel costs. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales was 17.3%, flat to prior year and better than the Company expected, due to solid expense control.
Inventory
Total inventories as of April 26, 2008, were $2.9 billion compared with $2.8 billion at the same time in the prior year. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, at April 26, 2008, were down 3% versus being up 7% at the same time last year. At the Marmaxx division, the total inventory commitment, including the warehouses, stores and merchandise on order, was down versus last year on a per-store basis. The Company remains very comfortable with its inventory levels and the liquidity within its inventories, which position it very well entering the second quarter to take advantage of buying opportunities.
Share Repurchases
During the first quarter, the Company spent a total of $225 million in repurchases of TJX stock, retiring 7.0 million shares. It remains the Companys plan to repurchase at least $900 million of TJX stock in Fiscal 2009.
Second Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2009 Outlook
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company expects earnings per share in the range of $.40 to $.42. This compares to $.13 in earnings per share in the prior year, which includes a $.25 per share charge related to the previously announced computer intrusion(s). Excluding this charge, the Companys estimated range for Fiscal 2009 second quarter earnings per share represents a 5%-11% increase over prior years adjusted diluted earnings per share of $.38. This range is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of approximately 3%, of which approximately 0.5 percentage points is due to the impact of foreign exchange.
For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009, the Company is maintaining its guidance of earnings per share in the range of $2.20 to $2.25. This range represents a 33% - 36% increase over earnings per share of $1.66 in the prior year, which include a charge of $119 million or $.25 per share related to the previously announced computer intrusion(s). Excluding this charge, this range represents a 15% to 18% increase over the $1.91 adjusted earnings per share in Fiscal 2008. This range includes an expected $.09 per share benefit from the 53 week in the Companys Fiscal 2009 calendar. Excluding this benefit, the estimated range of $2.11 - $2.16 represents a 10% to 13% increase over the adjusted $1.91 in earnings per share last year. This range is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 2% to 3%, of which approximately 0.5 percentage points is due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

Stores by Concept
During the first quarter, the Company added a total of 33 stores. TJX increased square footage by 4% over the same period last year.

The TJX Companies, Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Condensed Statements
1. During the first quarter ended April 26, 2008, TJX repurchased 7.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $225 million. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of settlement of repurchases. Under the current $1 billion stock repurchase program, approved by the Board of Directors in January 2007, TJX repurchased 24.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $739 million through the fiscal 2009 first quarter. In February 2008, TJXs Board of Directors authorized another multi-year stock repurchase plan of $1 billion, which is in addition to the $261 million remaining under the current program.
2. As of April 26, 2008 TJX assessed its FIN 48 tax liability and as a result of certain actions taken by the Company, TJX was able to reduce its FIN 48 tax liability by approximately $12 million. This tax benefit resulted in an increase of $12 million in net income, or $0.02 per share, for the first quarter ended April 26, 2008.
3. TJX suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions into portions of its computer system that process and store information related to credit and debit card, check and unreceipted merchandise return transactions (the intrusion or intrusions, collectively, the Computer Intrusion), which was discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, and the related theft of customer data, primarily related to portions of the transactions at its stores (other than Bob's Stores) during the periods 2003 through June 2004 and mid-May 2006 through mid-December 2006.
TJX was not able to reasonably estimate the losses it would incur as a result of the Computer Intrusion until the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Prior to establishing this reserve, TJX expensed the costs related to the Computer Intrusion as incurred. The costs incurred in connection with the Computer Intrusion for the first quarter ended April 28, 2007 amounted to a pre-tax charge of $20 million, which reduced net income by $12 million, or $0.03 per share.
4. The following is a reconciliation of our first quarter diluted earnings per share, as reported on a GAAP basis, to the adjusted diluted earnings per share referenced in our earnings release.
