The TJX Companies, Inc. (the "Company") and Ernie Herrman, Senior Executive Vice President, Group President of the Company, entered into a new employment agreement, effective as of January 29, 2010. The term of the agreement continues until February 2, 2013, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. The agreement provides for a minimum base salary of $925,000 and participation in specified benefit programs at levels commensurate with his position and responsibilities. If, prior to the end of the term, the Company terminates Mr. Herrman's employment (other than for cause) or Mr. Hermann terminates his employment in connection with a relocation of more than forty miles, Mr. Herrman is entitled to continuation of base salary and any automobile allowance for a period of twenty-four months; a cash payment (grossed up for taxes) to cover the cost of any COBRA continuation of medical benefits that Mr. Herrman elects, subject to possible early termination if Mr. Herrman obtains other coverage; certain cash incentive awards (Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and Long Range Performance Incentive Plan (LRPIP)) for the year or award cycle in which termination occurs, subject to attainment of the applicable performance goals and adjusted to reflect his period of service during the year or cycle; and vested and accrued, but unpaid, pay and benefits. Mr. Herrman is also entitled to these severance benefits upon termination of his employment during the term if he dies or becomes disabled (except that base salary continuation would be offset by any long-term disability benefits and the MIP award would be his unprorated target MIP award), or if the Company fails to offer him continued service in a comparable position, as reasonably determined by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, at the end of the term of the agreement.
Mr. Herrman agreed to non-competition and non-solicitation provisions during the term of his employment and for twenty-four months thereafter and to confidentiality provisions during and after his employment. Benefits under the agreement are conditioned on compliance with these covenants.
If a change of control occurs during the term of the agreement (with or without a termination of employment), Mr. Herrman is entitled to receive, in addition to any earned but unpaid MIP and LRPIP awards, a lump sum payment equal to his target MIP award for the year in which the change of control occurs, plus his target MIP award for that year prorated for his period of service, plus the maximum award for each uncompleted LRPIP cycle. In addition, upon a change of control, Mr. Herrman is not subject to the non-competition covenant described above following termination of employment. If Mr. Herrman's employment terminates due to his death or disability, if the Company terminates his employment other than for cause, or if he terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the agreement), within twenty-four months following a change of control and prior to the end of the term, instead of the severance benefits payable prior to a change of control, Mr. Herrman is entitled to receive a payment equal to two times his annual base salary (offset by any long-term disability benefits) plus the value of two years of any automobile allowance; continued life and medical insurance for two years, except to the extent he has coverage from another employer; and vested and accrued, but unpaid, pay and benefits. If certain excise taxes would be incurred by Mr. Herrman in connection with a change of control, the Company is obligated to reduce or eliminate his benefits to the extent necessary to maximize his after-tax benefit. The Company is also obligated to pay Mr. Herrman all legal fees and expenses he reasonably incurs in seeking enforcement of his contractual rights following a change of control.
The description of the agreement set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) EXHIBITS.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: January 29, 2010

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
ERNIE HERRMAN
     AGREEMENT dated as of January 29, 2010 between ERNIE HERRMAN ("Executive") and The TJX Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose principal office is in Framingham, Massachusetts 01701(the "Company").
     The Company and Executive intend that the Executive shall be employed by the Company on the terms set forth below and, to that end, deem it desirable and appropriate to enter into this Agreement.
     The parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter contained, agree as follows:
     1. EFFECTIVE DATE; TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall become effective as of January 29, 2010 (the "Effective Date"). Upon effectiveness of this Agreement on the Effective Date, the Employment Agreement between the Company and the Executive dated as of September 8, 2006 (as amended, the "Prior Agreement") shall terminate and be of no further force and effect. Subject to earlier termination as provided herein, Executive's employment hereunder shall continue on the terms provided herein until February 2, 2013 (the "End Date"). The period of Executive's employment by the Company from and after the Effective Date, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, is referred to in this Agreement as the "Employment Period," it being understood that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as entitling Executive to continuation of his employment beyond the End Date and that any such continuation shall be subject to the agreement of the parties. This Agreement is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A and shall be construed accordingly.
     2. SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT.
     (a) . Executive shall diligently perform such duties and assume such responsibilities as shall from time to time be specified by the Company.
Nature of Services
     (b) . Except for illnesses and vacation periods, Executive shall devote substantially all his working time and attention and his best efforts to the performance of his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement. However, Executive may (i) make any passive investments where he is not obligated or required to, and shall not in fact, devote any managerial efforts, (ii) subject to approval by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or withdrawn), participate in charitable or community activities or in trade or professional organizations, or (iii) subject to approval by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or withdrawn), hold directorships in public companies, except only that the Company shall have the right to limit such services as a director or such participation in
Extent of Services
 
charitable or community activities or in trade or professional organizations whenever the Company shall believe that the time spent on such activities infringes in any material respect upon the time required by Executive for the performance of his duties under this Agreement or is otherwise incompatible with those duties.
     3. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.
     (a) . Executive shall be paid a base salary at the rate hereinafter specified, such Base Salary to be paid in the same manner and at the same times as the Company shall pay base salary to other executive employees. The rate at which Executive's Base Salary shall be paid shall be $925,000 per year or such other rate (not less than $925,000 per year) as the Committee may determine after Committee review not less frequently than annually.
Base Salary
     (b) . Reference is made to outstanding awards to Executive of stock options and of performance-based restricted stock made prior to the Effective Date under the Company's Stock Incentive Plan (including any successor, the "Stock Incentive Plan"), to the award opportunity granted to Executive for FYE 2010 under the Company's Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"), and to award opportunities granted to Executive under the Company's Long Range Performance Incentive Plan ("LRPIP") for cycles beginning before the Effective Date. Each of such awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall continue for such period or periods and in accordance with such terms as are set out in the applicable grant, award certificate, award agreement and other governing documents relating to such awards and shall not be affected by the terms of this Agreement except as otherwise expressly provided herein.
Existing Awards
     (c) . Consistent with the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan, during the Employment Period, Executive will be entitled to stock-based awards under the Stock Incentive Plan at levels commensurate with his position and responsibilities and subject to such terms as shall be established by the Committee.
New Stock Awards
     (d) . During the Employment Period, Executive will be eligible to participate in annual grants under LRPIP at a level commensurate with his position and responsibilities and subject to such terms as shall be established by the Committee.
LRPIP
     (e) . During the Employment Period, Executive will be eligible to participate in annual awards under MIP at a level commensurate with his position and responsibilities and subject to such terms as shall be established by the Committee.
MIP
     (f) . Executive shall be entitled during the Employment Period to participate in the Company's tax-qualified retirement and profit-sharing plans maintained for the benefit of Company employees, and in the ESP, in each case in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, the amendment and termination provisions thereof).
Qualified Plans; Other Deferred Compensation Plans
     (g) . Executive shall be subject to Company policies applicable to its executives generally and shall be entitled to receive all such fringe benefits as the Company shall from time to time make available to other executives generally (subject to the terms of any applicable fringe benefit plan).
Policies and Fringe Benefits
 
     (h) . The Company is entitled to terminate Executive's employment notwithstanding the fact that Executive may lose entitlement to benefits under the arrangements described above. Upon termination of his employment, Executive shall have no claim against the Company for loss arising out of ineligibility to exercise any stock options granted to him or otherwise in relation to any of the stock options or other stock-based awards granted to Executive, and the rights of Executive shall be determined solely by the rules of the relevant award document and plan.
Other
     4. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; IN GENERAL.
     (a) The Company shall have the right to end Executive's employment at any time and for any reason, with or without Cause.
     (b) Executive's employment shall terminate upon written notice by the Company to Executive (or, if earlier, to the extent consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, upon the expiration of the twenty-nine (29)-month period commencing upon Executive's absence from work) if, by reason of Disability, Executive is unable to perform his duties for at least six continuous months. Any termination pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be treated for purposes of Section 5 and the definition of "Change of Control Termination" at subsection (a) of Exhibit A as a termination by reason of Disability.
     (c) Whenever his employment shall terminate, Executive shall resign all offices or other positions he shall hold with the Company and any affiliated corporations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Employment Period shall terminate upon termination of Executive's employment for any reason.
     5. BENEFITS UPON NON-VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
     (a) . If the Employment Period shall have terminated prior to the End Date by reason of (I) death or Disability of Executive, (II) termination by the Company for any reason other than Cause or (III) a Constructive Termination, then all compensation and benefits for Executive shall be as follows:
Certain Terminations Prior to the End Date
     (i) For a period of twenty-four (24) months after the Date of Termination (the "termination period"), the Company will pay to Executive or his legal representative, without reduction for compensation earned from other employment or self employment, continued Base Salary at the rate in effect at termination of employment in accordance with its regular payroll practices for executive employees of the Company (but not less frequently than monthly); , that if Executive is a Specified Employee at the relevant time, the Base Salary that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period beginning on the Date of Termination shall instead be accumulated and paid, without interest, in a lump sum on the date that is six (6) months and one day after such date (or, if earlier, the date of Executive's death); that if Executive is eligible for long-term disability compensation benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan, the amount payable under this clause shall be paid at a rate equal to the excess of (a) the rate of Base Salary in effect at termination of employment, over (b) the
provided
and further provided,
 
long-term disability compensation benefits for which Executive is approved under such plan.
     (ii) If Executive elects so-called "COBRA" continuation of group health plan coverage provided pursuant to Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, there shall be added to the amounts otherwise payable under Section 5(a)(i) above, during the continuation of such coverage, an amount (grossed up for federal and state income taxes) equal to the participant cost of such coverage, except to the extent that Executive shall obtain no less favorable coverage from another employer or from self-employment in which case such additional payments shall cease immediately.
     (iii) The Company will pay to Executive or his legal representative, without offset for compensation earned from other employment or self-employment, (A) any unpaid amounts to which Executive is entitled under MIP for the fiscal year of the Company ended immediately prior to Executive's termination of employment, (B) any unpaid amounts owing with respect to LRPIP cycles in which Executive participated and which were completed prior to termination. These amounts will be paid at the same time as other awards for such prior year or cycle are paid.
plus
     (iv) For any MIP performance period in which Executive participates that begins before and ends after the Date of Termination, and at the same time as other MIP awards for such performance period are paid, but in no event later than by the 15th day of the third month following the close of the fiscal year to which such MIP award relates, the Company will pay to Executive or his legal representative, without offset for compensation earned from other employment or self-employment, an amount equal to (A) the MIP award, if any, that Executive would have earned and been paid had he continued in office through the end of such fiscal year, determined without regard to any adjustment for individual performance factors, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is three hundred and sixty-five (365) plus the number of days during such fiscal year prior to termination, and the denominator of which is seven hundred and thirty (730); , that if the Employment Period shall have terminated by reason of Executive's death or Disability, this clause (iv) shall not apply and Executive instead shall be entitled to the MIP benefit described in Section 5(a)(viii) below; , that if Executive is a Specified Employee at the relevant time, the amounts described in this clause (iv) shall be paid not sooner than six (6) months and one day after termination.
provided, however
and further provided
     (v) For each LRPIP cycle in which Executive participates that begins before and ends after the Date of Termination, and at the same time as other LRPIP awards for such cycle are paid, but in no event later than by the 15th day of the third month following the close of the last of the Company's fiscal years in such cycle, the Company will pay to Executive or his legal representative, without offset for compensation earned from other employment or self-employment, an amount equal to (A) the LRPIP award, if any, that Executive would have earned and been paid had he continued in office through the end of such cycle, determined without regard to any adjustment for individual performance factors, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months
 
in such cycle completed prior to termination of employment and the denominator of which is the number of full months in such cycle; , that if Executive is a Specified Employee at the relevant time, the amounts described in this clause (v) shall be paid not sooner than six (6) months and one day after termination.
provided
     (vi) In addition, Executive or his legal representative shall be entitled to the Stock Incentive Plan benefits described in Section 3(b) (Existing Awards) and Section 3(c) (New Stock Awards), in each case in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable arrangement, and to payment of his vested benefits, if any, under the plans described in Section 3(f) (Qualified Plans; Other Deferred Compensation Plans) and any vested benefits under the Company's frozen GDCP.
     (vii) If termination occurs by reason of Disability, Executive shall also be entitled to such compensation, if any, as is payable pursuant to the Company's long-term disability plan. If for any period Executive receives long-term disability compensation payments under a long-term disability plan of the Company as well as payments under Section 5(a)(i) above, and if the sum of such payments (the "combined salary/disability benefit") exceeds the payment for such period to which Executive is entitled under Section 5(a)(i) above (determined without regard to the proviso set forth therein), he shall promptly pay such excess in reimbursement to the Company; that in no event shall application of this sentence result in reduction of Executive's combined salary/disability benefit below the level of long-term disability compensation payments to which Executive is entitled under the long-term disability plan or plans of the Company.
provided,
     (viii) If termination occurs by reason of death or Disability, Executive shall also be entitled to an amount equal to Executive's MIP Target Award for the year of termination, without proration. This amount will be paid at the same time as other MIP awards for such performance period are paid.
     (ix) Except as expressly set forth above or as required by law, Executive shall not be entitled to continue participation during the termination period in any employee benefit or fringe benefit plans, except for continuation of any automobile allowance which shall be added to the amounts otherwise payable under Section 5(a)(i) above during the continuation of such coverage but not beyond the end of the termination period.
     (b) . Unless earlier terminated or except as otherwise mutually agreed by Executive and the Company, Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate on the End Date. Unless the Company in connection with such termination shall offer to Executive continued service in a position on reasonable terms, Executive shall be treated as having been terminated under Section 5(a)(II) on the day immediately preceding the End Date and shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits described in Section 5(a) in respect of such a termination, subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the other provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation, Section 8. If the Company in connection with such termination offers to Executive continued service in a position on reasonable terms, and Executive declines such service, he shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having terminated his employment voluntarily on the End Date and he shall be entitled only to those benefits to which
Termination on the End Date
 
he would be entitled under Section 6(a) ("Voluntary termination of employment"). For purposes of the two preceding sentences, "service in a position on reasonable terms" shall mean service in a position comparable to the position in which Executive was serving immediately prior to the End Date, as reasonably determined by the Committee.
     6. OTHER TERMINATION.
     (a) . If Executive terminates his employment voluntarily, Executive or his legal representative shall be entitled (in each case in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable arrangement) to any Stock Incentive Plan benefits described in Section 3(b) (Existing Awards) or Section 3(c) (New Stock Awards) and to any vested benefits under the plans described in Section 3(f) (Qualified Plans; Other Deferred Compensation Plans) and any vested benefits under the Company's frozen GDCP. In addition, the Company will pay to Executive or his legal representative any unpaid amounts to which Executive is entitled under MIP for the fiscal year of the Company ended immediately prior to Executive's termination of employment, plus any unpaid amounts owing with respect to LRPIP cycles in which Executive participated and which were completed prior to termination, in each case at the same time as other awards for such prior year or cycle are paid. No other benefits shall be paid under this Agreement upon a voluntary termination of employment.
Voluntary termination of employment
     (b) . If the Company should end Executive's employment for Cause all compensation and benefits otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, other than (x) such vested amounts as are credited to Executive's account (but not received) under the ESP and the frozen GDCP in accordance with the terms of those programs; (y) any vested benefits to which Executive is entitled under the Company's tax-qualified plans; and (z) Stock Incentive Plan benefits, if any, to which Executive may be entitled (in each case in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable arrangement) under Sections 3(b) (Existing Awards) and 3(c) (New Stock Awards).
Termination for Cause
     7. BENEFITS UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event of a Change of Control, the determination and payment of any benefits payable thereafter with respect to Executive shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of Exhibit C; , for the avoidance of doubt, that the provisions of Section 11 of this Agreement shall also apply to the determination and payment of any payments or benefits pursuant to Exhibit C.
provided
     8. AGREEMENT NOT TO SOLICIT OR COMPETE.
     (a) During the Employment Period and for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (the "Nonsolicitation Period"), Executive shall not, and shall not direct any other individual or entity to, directly or indirectly (including as a partner, shareholder, joint venturer or other investor) (i) hire, offer to hire, attempt to hire or assist in the hiring of, any protected person as an employee, director, consultant, advisor or other service provider, (ii) recommend any protected person for employment or other engagement with any person or entity other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) solicit for employment or other engagement any protected person, or seek to persuade, induce or encourage any protected person to discontinue employment or engagement with the Company or its Subsidiaries, or recommend to any
 
protected person any employment or engagement other than with the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iv) accept services of any sort (whether for compensation or otherwise) from any protected person, or (v) participate with any other person or entity in any of the foregoing activities. Any individual or entity to which Executive provides services (as an employee, director, consultant, advisor or otherwise) or in which Executive is a shareholder, member, partner, joint venturer or investor, excluding interests in the common stock of any publicly traded corporation of one percent (1%) or less, and any individual or entity that is affiliated with any such individual or entity, shall, for purposes of the preceding sentence, be irrebuttably presumed to have acted at the direction of Executive with respect to any "protected person" who worked with Executive at any time during the six (6) months prior to termination of the Employment Period. A "protected person" is a person who at the time of termination of the Employment Period, or within six (6) months prior thereto, is or was employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries either in a position of Assistant Vice President or higher, or in a salaried position in any merchandising group. As to (I) each "protected person" to whom the foregoing applies, (II) each subcategory of "protected person," as defined above, (III) each limitation on (A) employment or other engagement, (B) solicitation and (C) unsolicited acceptance of services, of each "protected person" and (IV) each month of the period during which the provisions of this subsection (a) apply to each of the foregoing, the provisions set forth in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to be separate and independent agreements. In the event of unenforceability of any one or more such agreement(s), such unenforceable agreement(s) shall be deemed automatically reformed in order to allow for the greatest degree of enforceability authorized by law or, if no such reformation is possible, deleted from the provisions hereof entirely, and such reformation or deletion shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision of this subsection (a) or any other term of this Agreement.
     (b) During the course of his employment, Executive will have learned vital trade secrets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and will have access to confidential and proprietary information and business plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Therefore, during the Employment Period and for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (the "Noncompetition Period"), Executive will not, directly or indirectly, be a shareholder, member, partner, joint venturer or investor (disregarding in this connection passive ownership for investment purposes of common stock representing one percent (1%) or less of the voting power or value of any publicly traded corporation) in, serve as a director or manager of, be engaged in any employment, consulting, or fees-for-services relationship or arrangement with, or advise with respect to the organization or conduct of, or any investment in, any "competitive business" as hereinafter defined or any Person that engages in any "competitive business" as hereinafter defined, nor shall Executive undertake any planning to engage in any such activities. The term "competitive business" (i) shall mean any business (however organized or conducted) that competes with a business in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was engaged, or in which the Company or any Subsidiary was planning to engage, at any time during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date on which the Employment Period ends, and (ii) shall conclusively be presumed to include, but shall not be limited to, (A) any business specified on Exhibit D to this Agreement, and (B) any other off-price, promotional, or warehouse-club-type retail business, however organized or conducted, that sells apparel, footwear, home fashions, home furnishings, jewelry, accessories, or any other category of merchandise sold by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the termination of the Employment Period. For purposes of this subsection (b), a "Person" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company,
 
an association, a partnership, an estate, a trust and any other entity or organization, other than the Company or its Subsidiaries, and reference to any Person (the "first Person") shall be deemed to include any other Person that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the first Person. If, at any time, pursuant to action of any court, administrative, arbitral or governmental body or other tribunal, the operation of any part of this subsection shall be determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, then the coverage of this subsection shall be deemed to be reformed and restricted as to substantive reach, duration, geographic scope or otherwise, as the case may be, to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to make this paragraph lawful and enforceable to the greatest extent possible in the particular jurisdiction in which such determination is made.
     (c) Executive shall never use or disclose any confidential or proprietary information of the Company or its Subsidiaries other than as required by applicable law or during the Employment Period for the proper performance of Executive's duties and responsibilities to the Company and its Subsidiaries. This restriction shall continue to apply after Executive's employment terminates, regardless of the reason for such termination. All documents, records and files, in any media, relating to the business, present or otherwise, of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any copies ("Documents"), whether or not prepared by Executive, are the exclusive property of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Executive must diligently safeguard all Documents, and must surrender to the Company at such time or times as the Company may specify all Documents then in Executive's possession or control. In addition, upon termination of employment for any reason other than the death of Executive, Executive shall immediately return all Documents, and shall execute a certificate representing and warranting that he has returned all such Documents in Executive's possession or under his control.
     (d) If, during the Employment Period or at any time following termination of the Employment Period, regardless of the reason for such termination, Executive breaches any provision of this Section 8, the Company's obligation, if any, to pay benefits under Section 5 hereof shall forthwith cease and Executive shall immediately forfeit and disgorge to the Company, with interest at the prime rate in effect at Bank of America, or its successor, all of the following: (i) any benefits theretofore paid to Executive under Section 5; (ii) any unexercised stock options and stock appreciation rights held by Executive; (iii) if any other stock-based award vested in connection with termination of the Employment Period, whether occurring prior to, simultaneously with, or following such breach, or subsequent to such breach and prior to termination of the Employment Period, the value of such stock-based award at time of vesting plus any additional gain realized on a subsequent sale or disposition of the award or the underlying stock; and (iv) in respect of each stock option or stock appreciation right exercised by Executive within six (6) months prior to any such breach or subsequent thereto and prior to the forfeiture and disgorgement required by this Section 8(d), the excess over the exercise price (or base value, in the case of a stock appreciation right) of the greater of (A) the fair market value at time of exercise of the shares of stock subject to the award, or (B) the number of shares of stock subject to such award multiplied by the per-share proceeds of any sale of such stock by Executive.
     (e) Executive shall notify the Company immediately upon securing employment or becoming self-employed at any time within the Noncompetition Period or the Nonsolicitation
 
Period, and shall provide to the Company such details concerning such employment or self-employment as it may reasonably request in order to ensure compliance with the terms hereof.
     (f) Executive hereby advises the Company that Executive has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed on Executive under this Section 8, and agrees without reservation that each of the restraints contained herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the good will, confidential information and other legitimate business interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries, that each and every one of those restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area; and that these restraints will not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which Executive is bound by them. Executive agrees that Executive will never assert, or permit to be asserted on his behalf, in any forum, any position contrary to the foregoing. Executive also acknowledges and agrees that, were Executive to breach any of the provisions of this Section 8, the harm to the Company and its Subsidiaries would be irreparable. Executive therefore agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the Company shall, in addition to any other remedies available to it, have the right to obtain preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any such breach or threatened breach without having to post bond, and will additionally be entitled to an award of attorney's fees incurred in connection with enforcing its rights hereunder. Executive further agrees that, in the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. Finally, Executive agrees that the Noncompetition Period and the Nonsolicitation Period shall be tolled, and shall not run, during any period of time in which Executive is in violation of any of the terms of this Section 8, in order that the Company shall have the agreed-upon temporal protection recited herein.
     (g) Executive agrees that if any of the restrictions in this Section 8 is held to be void or ineffective for any reason but would be held to be valid and effective if part of its wording were deleted, that restriction shall apply with such deletions as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. Executive further agrees that the restrictions contained in each subsection of this Section 8 shall be construed as separate and individual restrictions and shall each be capable of being severed without prejudice to the other restrictions or to the remaining provisions.
     (h) Executive expressly consents to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and any successor or permitted assign to whose employ Executive may be transferred, without the necessity that this Agreement be re-signed at the time of such transfer. Executive further agrees that no changes in the nature or scope of his employment with the Company will operate to extinguish the terms and conditions set forth in Section 8, or otherwise require the parties to re-sign this Agreement.
     (i) The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive the termination of the Employment Period and the termination of this Agreement, regardless of the reason or reasons therefor, and shall be binding on Executive regardless of any breach by the Company of any other provision of this Agreement.
 
     9. ASSIGNMENT. The rights and obligations of the Company shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company. The rights and obligations of Executive are not assignable except only that stock issuable, awards and payments payable to him after his death shall be made to his estate except as otherwise provided by the applicable plan or award documentation, if any.
     10. NOTICES. All notices and other communications required hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by mailing the same by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

     C.1. .
Benefits Upon a Change of Control Termination
     (a) The Company shall pay the following to Executive (i) as hereinafter provided an amount equal to two times his Base Salary for one year at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination or the Change of Control, whichever is higher, plus (ii) within thirty (30) days following the Change of Control Termination, the accrued and unpaid portion of his Base Salary through the Date of Termination, subject to the following. If Executive is eligible for long-term disability compensation benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan, the amount payable under (i) shall be reduced by the annual long-term disability compensation benefit for which Executive is eligible under such plan for the two-year period over which the amount payable under (i) is measured. If for any period Executive receives long-term disability compensation payments under a long-term disability plan of the Company as well as payments under the first sentence of this subsection (a), and if the sum of such payments (the "combined Change of Control/disability benefit") exceeds the payment for such period to which Executive is entitled under the first sentence of this subsection (a) (determined without regard to the second sentence of this subsection (a)), he shall promptly pay such excess in reimbursement to the Company; that in no event shall application of this sentence result in reduction of Executive's combined Change of Control/disability benefit below the level of long-term disability compensation payments to which Executive is entitled under the long-term disability plan or plans of the Company. If the Change of Control Termination occurs in connection with a Change of Control that is also a Change in Control Event, the amount described in subsection (a)(i) shall be paid in a lump sum on the date that is six (6) months and one day following the date of the Change of Control Termination (or, if earlier, the date of Executive's death), unless the Executive is not a Specified Employee on the relevant date, in which case the amount described in this subsection (a) shall instead be paid thirty (30) days following the date of the Change of Control Termination. If the Change of Control Termination occurs in connection with a Change of Control that is not a Change in Control Event, the amount described in subsection (a)(i) above shall be paid, except as otherwise required by Section 11 of the Agreement, in the same manner as it would have been paid in the case of a termination by the Company other than for Cause under Section 5(a), and in lieu of the MIP and LRPIP benefits described in Section C.2, Executive shall be entitled to the MIP and LRPIP benefits, if any, described in Section 5(a)(iv) and Section 5(a)(v) of the Agreement, payable in accordance with such Sections.
provided,
     (b) Until the second anniversary of the Date of Termination, the Company shall maintain in full force and effect for the continued benefit of Executive and his family all life insurance and medical insurance plans and programs in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Change of Control, provided, that Executive's continued participation is possible under the general terms and provisions of such plans and programs. In the event that Executive is ineligible to participate in such plans or programs, the Company shall arrange upon comparable terms to provide Executive with benefits substantially similar to those which he is entitled to receive under such plans and programs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's obligations hereunder with respect to life or medical coverage or benefits shall be
 
deemed satisfied to the extent (but only to the extent) of any such coverage or benefits provided by another employer.
     (c) On the date that is six (6) months and one day following the date of the Change of Control Termination (or, if earlier, the date of Executive's death), the Company shall pay to Executive or his estate, in lieu of any automobile allowance, the present value of the automobile allowance (at the rate in effect prior to the Change of Control) it would have paid for the two years following the Change of Control Termination (or until the earlier date of Executive's death, if Executive dies prior to the date of the payment under this Section C.1(c)); , that if the Change of Control is not a Change of Control Event, such amount shall instead be paid in the same manner as Executive's automobile allowance would have been paid in the case of a termination by the Company other than for Cause under Section 5(a); , that if Executive is not a Specified Employee on the relevant date, any lump sum payable under this Section C.1(c) shall instead by paid within thirty (30) days following the Change of Control Termination.
provided
and further provided
     C.2. . Within thirty (30) days following a Change of Control that is also a Change in Control Event, whether or not Executive's employment has terminated or been terminated, the Company shall pay to Executive, in a lump sum, the sum of (i) and (ii), where:
Incentive Benefits Upon a Change of Control
     (i) is the sum of (A) the "Target Award" under MIP or any other annual incentive plan which is applicable to Executive for the fiscal year in which the Change of Control occurs, plus (B) an amount equal to such Target Award prorated for the period of active employment during such fiscal year through the Change of Control, plus (C) any unpaid amounts to which Executive is entitled under MIP with respect to any fiscal year completed prior to the Change of Control; and
     (ii) the sum of (A) for Performance Cycles not completed prior to the Change of Control, an amount with respect to each such cycle equal to the maximum Award under LRPIP specified for Executive for such cycle, plus (B) any unpaid amounts owing with respect to LRPIP cycles completed prior to the Change of Control.
If the Change of Control is not also a Change in Control Event, for the avoidance of doubt, Executive shall continue to participate in MIP and LRPIP (or such other incentive plans, if any, in which Executive was participating) in accordance with their terms, subject to Section C.1. above, and shall not be entitled to the supplemental or accelerated payments described in Section C.2.(i) and Section C.2.(ii) above.
     C.3. . Payments under Section C.1. and Section C.2. of this Exhibit shall be made without regard to whether the deductibility of such payments (or any other payments or benefits to or for the benefit of Executive) would be limited or precluded by Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G") and without regard to whether such payments (or any other payments or benefits) would subject Executive to the federal excise tax levied on certain "excess parachute payments" under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"); , that if the total of all payments to or for the benefit of Executive, after reduction for all federal taxes (including the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code) with respect to such
Payment Adjustment
provided
 
payments ("Executive's total after-tax payments"), would be increased by the limitation or elimination of any payment under Section C.1. or Section C.2. of this Exhibit, or by an adjustment to the vesting of any equity-based awards that would otherwise vest on an accelerated basis in connection with the Change of Control, amounts payable under Section C.1. and Section C.2. of this Exhibit shall be reduced and the vesting of equity-based awards shall be adjusted to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to maximize Executive's total after-tax payments. Any reduction in payments or adjustment of vesting required by the preceding sentence shall be applied, first, against any benefits payable under Section C.1(a)(i) of this Exhibit, then against any benefits payable under Section C.2. of this Exhibit, then against the vesting of any performance-based restricted stock awards that would otherwise have vested in connection with the Change of Control, then against the vesting of any other equity-based awards, if any, that would otherwise have vested in connection with the Change of Control, and finally against all other payments, if any. The determination as to whether Executive's payments and benefits include "excess parachute payments" and, if so, the amount and ordering of any reductions in payment required by the provisions of this Section C.3. shall be made at the Company's expense by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or by such other certified public accounting firm as the Committee may designate prior to a Change of Control (the "accounting firm"). In the event of any underpayment or overpayment hereunder, as determined by the accounting firm, the amount of such underpayment or overpayment shall forthwith and in all events within thirty (30) days of such determination be paid to Executive or refunded to the Company, as the case may be, with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.
     C.4. . In addition to the amounts described in Sections C.1. and C.2., Executive or his legal representative shall be entitled to his Stock Incentive Plan benefits, if any, under Section 3(b) (Existing Awards) and Section 3(c) (New Stock Awards), and to the payment of his vested benefits under the plans described in Section 3(f) (Qualified Plans; Other Deferred Compensation Plans) and any vested benefits under the Company's frozen GDCP.
Other Benefits
     C.5. .
Noncompetition; No Mitigation of Damages; etc
     (a) . Upon a Change of Control, any agreement by Executive not to engage in competition with the Company subsequent to the termination of his employment, whether contained in an employment agreement or other agreement, shall no longer be effective.
Noncompetition
     (b) . Executive's benefits under this Exhibit C shall be considered severance pay in consideration of his past service and his continued service from the date of this Agreement, and his entitlement thereto shall neither be governed by any duty to mitigate his damages by seeking further employment nor offset by any compensation which he may receive from future employment.
No Duty to Mitigate Damages
     (c) . The Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses, including but not limited to counsel fees, stenographer fees, printing costs, etc. reasonably incurred by Executive in contesting or disputing that the termination of his employment during a Standstill Period is for Cause or other than for good reason (as defined in the definition of Change of Control Termination) or obtaining any right or benefit to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement following a Change of Control. Any amount payable under this Agreement that is not paid when due shall accrue interest at the prime rate as from time to time
Legal Fees and Expenses
 
in effect at Bank of America, or its successor, until paid in full. All payments and reimbursements under this Section shall be made consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 409A.
     (d) . During a Standstill Period, Executive's employment may be terminated by the Company only upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Executive.
