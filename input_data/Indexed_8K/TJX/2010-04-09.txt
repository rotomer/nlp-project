On April 5, 2010, the Executive Compensation Committee (ECC) of the Board of Directors of The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) amended TJX's Executive Savings Plan (ESP), a plan under which eligible employees can defer up to 20% of base salary and up to 100% of annual and long-term cash bonuses each calendar year and receive matching credits. Under the amendment, named executive officers Ernie Herrman, Senior Executive Vice President, Group President, and Jeffrey G. Naylor, Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, (who are not eligible for the primary benefit under TJX's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan) will be entitled to receive each year for up to 15 years a 100% match on deferrals of up to 10% of base salary, together with an additional match ranging between 50% to 150% of deferrals of up to 10% of base salary if performance under TJXs Management Incentive Plan for the relevant fiscal year produces a payout of between 90% and 125% of the target corporate award opportunities. The amendment also makes certain other changes to the administration of the ESP, including requiring participants to comply with any applicable confidentiality, noncompetition, nonsolicitation or related agreement in order to receive and/or retain amounts attributable to the additional employer credits provided by this amendment.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
