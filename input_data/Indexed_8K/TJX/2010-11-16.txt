Exhibit 99.1
The TJX Companies, Inc. Reports Strong Q3 FY11 EPS, Up 14% Over 40% Growth Last Year
FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 16, 2010--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 30, 2010. Net sales for the third quarter of Fiscal 2011 increased 5% to $5.5 billion and consolidated comparable store sales increased 1% over last year. Net income for the third quarter was $372 million. Diluted earnings per share were $.92, up 14% over $.81 per share last year.
For the first nine months of Fiscal 2011, net sales were $15.6 billion, a 9% increase over last year, and consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over the prior year. Net income was $1.0 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $2.46 up 29% over $1.91 per share in the same period last year. Excluding the non-operating item detailed under Items Impacting Comparability (see below), adjusted diluted EPS for the first nine months of Fiscal 2011 were $2.45, a 28% increase over the prior year.
Carol Meyrowitz, President and Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, I am very pleased with our third quarter overall performance, which exceeded the high end of our expectations. Earnings per share increased 14% on top of 40% EPS growth last year, demonstrating our ability to continue to grow earnings even against challenging comparisons. Importantly, we were able to sustain last years significant increase in profit margin by continuing to run our business with lean inventories, which has led to additional improvement in merchandise margins. Customer traffic continued to be up over large increases last year despite warm weather in September and October, which dampened demand for cold weather apparel. With the weather cooling, November is off to a good start. We are extremely well positioned as we enter the fourth quarter. Our lean inventory position enables us to make the right buys and deliver great value. Further, we believe that our heightened marketing, which is reaching more markets, is helping to drive customer traffic. We will be flowing fresh, gift-giving selections in a variety of categories throughout the holiday selling season and believe that value will continue to be top of mind for consumers.
Sales by Business Segment
The Companys comparable store sales and net sales by division, in the third quarter, were as follows:
Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Companys international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the magnitude of these translations and adjustments, and can have a material impact when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates.
The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on consolidated net sales growth in the third quarter of Fiscal 2011. For the first nine months of Fiscal 2011, the movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a 1 percentage-point favorable impact on consolidated net sales growth. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on earnings per share is discussed below under Items Impacting Comparability.
A table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, is on the Companys website, .

Items Impacting Comparability
Foreign currency exchange rates had an overall net positive impact on third quarter earnings per share of $.01, in this years third quarter, compared with a $.03 per share positive impact last year.
Results for the first nine months of Fiscal 2011 include the earnings benefit from a non-operating item, a reduction in the Companys provision related to the previously announced computer intrusion(s), which positively impacted earnings per share by $.01. Excluding this non-operating item, adjusted earnings per share in the first nine months were $2.45, a 28% increase over last years $1.91. Foreign currency exchange rates had an overall net positive impact on earnings per share for the first nine months of Fiscal 2011 of $.02, compared with an immaterial impact for the same period in the prior year.
Margins
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Companys consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.8%, flat to the prior year, in which the consolidated pretax profit margin increased significantly by 2.0 percentage points.
The gross profit margin for the Fiscal 2011 third quarter was 27.5%, flat to the prior year. Merchandise margin improvement and buying and occupancy cost leverage were offset by the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to the Companys inventory related hedges. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales were 16.5%, also flat to the prior year.
Inventory
Total inventories as of October 30, 2010, were $3.3 billion compared with $3.3 billion at the end of the prior years third quarter. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, at October 30, 2010, were down 6% versus being down 5% at the end of the third quarter last year. The Company remains very comfortable with its inventory liquidity, which positions it very well to flow fresh merchandise throughout the holiday selling season.
Share Repurchases
During the third quarter, the Company spent a total of $256 million in repurchases of TJX stock, retiring 6.0 million shares. For the first nine months of Fiscal 2011, the Company has spent a total of $845 million in repurchases of TJX stock, retiring 19.7 million shares. The Company now expects to repurchase $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion of TJX stock in Fiscal 2011, which is more than originally planned. The Company may adjust the amount of this spending up or down depending on various factors.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2011 Outlook
For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $.89 to $.94, which would represent flat to a 5% decrease versus $.94 per share in the prior year, and remains unchanged from the prior outlook. This is based upon an estimated range for consolidated comparable store sales of a 1% to 3% decrease compared to a 12% increase in the fourth quarter of last year.
For the full year Fiscal 2011, the Company is now expecting diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.40 on a reported basis, or $3.33 to $3.38 on an adjusted basis, excluding the non-operating item described above, which would represent a 17% to 19% increase over $2.84 per share last year. This range is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%.
The Companys earnings guidance assumes that currency exchange rates will remain at current levels.
Stores by Concept
During the third quarter ended October 30, 2010, the Company added a net of 74 stores. TJX increased square footage by 4% over the same period last year.

The TJX Companies, Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Condensed Statements
During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, TJX completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program begun in fiscal 2010 and initiated another multi-year $1 billion stock repurchase program that had been approved in February 2010. Under both plans during the third quarter, TJX repurchased 6.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $256 million. Under both plans for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2010, TJX repurchased 19.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $845 million. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases.
In April 2009, TJX issued $375 million of 6.950% ten year notes and shortly thereafter called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, originally due in 2021. Virtually all of the subordinated notes were converted into 15.1 million shares of TJX common stock during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company used the proceeds from the notes offering to repurchase TJX common stock under its stock repurchase program.
In July 2009, TJX issued $400 million of 4.200% six year notes. TJX used the proceeds of this offering to pay its 7.45% notes due December 15, 2009 at maturity and refinanced substantially all of its C$235 million term credit facility, which was repaid on August 10, 2009.
