Exhibit 99.1
The TJX Companies, Inc. Sees Momentum Continue; Reports 24% Increase in Second Quarter EPS; Raises Full-Year Guidance
FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 14, 2012--The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the second quarter ended July 28, 2012. Net sales for the second quarter of Fiscal 2013 increased 9% to $5.9 billion and consolidated comparable store sales increased 7%. Net income for the second quarter was $421 million and diluted earnings per share were $.56, a 24% increase over $.45 per share last year.
For the first half of Fiscal 2013, net sales were $11.7 billion, a 10% increase over last year, and consolidated comparable store sales increased 8% over the same period last year. Net income was $840 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.11 compared to $.79 in the same period last year. Last years results include a number of items (detailed under Items Impacting Comparability below) that impacted the comparability of earnings per share. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share for the first six months of Fiscal 2013 increased 32% over the adjusted $.84 last year.
Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, We are extremely pleased that our strong momentum continued in the second quarter. Our 24% increase in earnings per share and 7% consolidated comparable store sales growth both significantly exceeded our original expectations, with every business posting excellent results. We are raising our full-year guidance to reflect our second quarter earnings per share. In addition, this marks the seventh consecutive year of very strong second quarter operating performance, which we believe demonstrates the sustainability of our sales and profit growth in both strong and weak economies. Customer traffic was up substantially at all divisions in the U.S., Canada and Europe and drove most of the comparable store sales increase, reflecting our on-point fashions and brands at great values. We are convinced that we will continue to attract more new and loyal customers in the U.S. and internationally with the power of our values, brand and fashion content, and wide customer demographic appeal. August is off to a strong start and we have many exciting opportunities for the second half of 2012. Our inventories are in excellent shape, we see a marketplace full of terrific brands and fashions, and we have great marketing campaigns and in-store initiatives planned. It's important to note that TJX is a company with a business model that enables us to succeed in most macro environments and, at the same time, has terrific growth potential. We are leveraging our four powerful divisions and have deep confidence in our ability to continue delivering profitable growth and high financial returns in the near and long term!
Sales by Business Segment
The Companys comparable store sales and net sales by division, in the second quarter, were as follows:
Comparable store sales outside the U.S. calculated on a constant currency basis, which removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. Sales in Canada and Europe were impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. See below. Figures may not foot due to rounding. Combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Companys international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary-course inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the magnitude of these translations and adjustments, and can have a material impact when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates.
The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a one percentage point negative impact on consolidated net sales growth in the second quarter of Fiscal 2013 versus the prior years second quarter. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on earnings per share is discussed below under Items Impacting Comparability.
A table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investor Information section of the Companys website, .

Items Impacting Comparability
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2013 the earnings per share impact of foreign currency exchange rates was neutral, compared with a $.01 per share positive impact last year.
For the first six months of Fiscal 2013, comparability to the prior year was impacted by the A.J. Wright consolidation in Fiscal 2012, detailed in the table below:
*Figures do not foot due to rounding.
The first six months of Fiscal 2012 included first quarter costs associated with the A.J. Wright consolidation, primarily additional lease obligations for store closings and additional operating losses as well as the costs related to the conversion and grand re-opening of certain former A.J. Wright stores to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods banners.
On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share for the first six months of Fiscal 2013 were $1.11 compared to $.79 last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding the items detailed above, diluted earnings per share for the first six months of Fiscal 2013 represented a 32% increase over last years adjusted $.84.
For the first six months of Fiscal 2013, foreign currency exchange rates had a $.01 negative impact on earnings per share, the same as the $.01 per share negative impact during the same period last year.
Margins
For the second quarter of Fiscal 2013, the Companys consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.5%, up 1.3 percentage points over the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by merchandise margin improvement and expense leverage.
The gross profit margin for the second quarter of Fiscal 2013 was 28.1%, 0.8 percentage points above the prior year. Strong merchandise margin growth as well as buying and occupancy leverage on above-plan sales, partially offset by a negative impact from mark-to-market adjustments on the Companys inventory-related hedges, drove the favorability.
Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales were 16.5% in the second quarter, a 0.4 percentage point improvement over the prior years ratio of 16.9%, primarily driven by expense leverage on above-plan sales growth.
Inventory
Total inventories as of July 28, 2012, were $3.0 billion, compared with $3.4 billion at the end of the second quarter last year. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the distribution centers, at July 28, 2012, were down 12% (down 11% on a constant currency basis) versus being up 16% at the end of the second quarter last year. Further, the Companys store inventory turns were faster than the prior year during the quarter. The Company enters the third quarter with excellent inventory levels and is very well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace and continue shipping ever-changing merchandise selections to its stores.
Share Repurchases
During the second quarter, the Company spent a total of $300 million in repurchases of TJX stock, retiring 7.1 million shares. For the first half of Fiscal 2013, the Company has spent a total of $550 million in repurchases of TJX stock, retiring 13.6 million shares, and it continues to expect to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of TJX stock in Fiscal 2013. The Company may adjust the amount of this spending up or down.
Third Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2013 Outlook
For the third quarter of Fiscal 2013, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.56 to $.59, which represents a 6% to 11% increase over $.53 per share last year. This outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 2% to 4%.
As mentioned above, for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2013, the Company is raising its guidance for diluted earnings per share by $.01 to reflect the Companys second quarter earnings. The Company now expects diluted earnings per share for the full year, on a GAAP basis, to be in the range of $2.39 to $2.45, compared with $1.93 in Fiscal 2012. This guidance represents a 20% to 23% increase over the prior years adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.99 (detailed below) and is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 4% to 5%.
The Companys full-year guidance includes an expected $.07 per share benefit from the 53 week in the Companys Fiscal 2013 calendar. Excluding this estimated benefit, this guidance represents a 17% to 20% increase over the prior years adjusted earnings per share.
rd
The Companys earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year Fiscal 2013 assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.
Stores by Concept
During the second quarter ended July 28, 2012, the Company increased its store count by a net of 32 stores. The Company increased its square footage by 4% over the same period last year.

The TJX Companies, Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Selected Information by Major Business Segment (Unaudited) (In Thousands)
The TJX Companies, Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Condensed Statements
On January 5, 2012, TJX announced that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock in the form of a stock dividend, payable February 2, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 17, 2012. The stock split resulted in the issuance of 373 million shares of common stock. All historical per share amounts and references to common stock activity, as well as basic and diluted share amounts, have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
During the second quarter ended July 28, 2012, TJX repurchased 7.1 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $300 million. During the six months ended July 28, 2012, TJX repurchased 13.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $550 million, with $225 million under the $1 billion stock repurchase plan approved in February 2011, completing the plan, and $325 million under the $2 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors early in fiscal 2013. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, TJXs Board of Directors approved the consolidation of its A.J. Wright division whereby 90 A.J. Wright stores were converted into T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods stores and the remaining 72 stores, its two distribution centers and home office were closed. The majority of the costs to consolidate A.J. Wright were recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 but due to the timing of the store closings the additional closing costs (primarily lease related obligations) and additional operating losses were reported as a $49 million A.J. Wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal 2012 included costs related to the conversion of the 90 A.J. Wright stores to other banners (primarily store payroll and occupancy costs during the approximate eight to twelve-week period in which the stores were closed) and costs related to grand opening events when the stores re-opened. These costs totaled $20 million, with $17 million reflected in the Marmaxx segment and $3 million in the HomeGoods segment for the six months ended July 30, 2011.
