FINANCIAL SUMMARY
(dollars in millions, except per share data)
 
 
 
 
 
HIGHLIGHTScomparing the third quarter 2003 with third quarter 2002:
 
 
INSURANCE OPERATIONScomparing the third quarter 2003 with third quarter 2002:
 
Torchmark's insurance operations consist of the sales and administration of life and supplemental health insurance. To a lesser extent, the Company also markets and administers variable and fixed annuities.
 
Insurance underwriting margin is management's measure of each insurance segment's underwriting performance, and consists of premiums less policy obligations, commissions and other acquisition expenses.
 
Insurance net underwriting income is management's measure of the sum of the insurance underwriting margins of the Company's insurance segments, plus other income, less insurance administrative expenses. It excludes the investment segment, parent company expense and income taxes.
 
Insurance underwriting results are summarized in the following chart:
 
 
Life Insurance
 
Life insurance is Torchmark's primary product line. This segment accounts for 65% of the Company's insurance underwriting margin. The life insurance underwriting margin as a percentage of premium was 25%. In addition, the investments supporting the reserves for the life segment generate most of the investment income that is included in the investment segment. Torchmark distributes life insurance through four major distribution channels: Direct Response, American Income Agency, Liberty National Agency and the Military Agency. At September 30, 2003, life insurance annualized premium in force was $1.4 billion, 57% of the total in force premium for the Company.
 
 
increased 7% to $330 million as double-digit life sales in five of the last six quarters are now favorably affecting life premiums. Annualized life premium in force at September 30, 2003, was $1.4 billion, an increase of 7%.
Premium revenue from life insurance
 
was $82 million, up 6%, and was 25% of premium revenue, the same as for the year-ago quarter. American Income was the leading contributor to life underwriting margin with $23 million, up 9%, followed closely by Direct Response with $22 million, up 12%. Direct Response also increased its underwriting margin as a percentage of premium to 25% from 24% a year ago.
Life insurance underwriting margin
 
of $96 million were up 12%. The Direct Response unit continued as the largest writer of new life insurance sales with $41 million, a 33% increase, in part due to its continued focus on its juvenile life sales which also led to increased sales to the parents of juvenile policyholders. American Income, the second largest life writer, had sales of $28 million, a 14% increase, while the Military distribution unit had double-digit growth of 13% from $7 million of life sales. Life sales by the LNL Agency were $13 million, down 10%, but reflected sales growth in its ongoing target market. In April of this year LNL had stopped sales to one market segment prone to high lapses, which earlier had accounted for 25% of LNL's life sales.
Life insurance sales
 
Recruiting new agents and growing the number of producing agents at the agency distribution channels is critical to growth in sales. American Income continued to increase its number of agents ending the quarter with 2,348, up 95 from June 30, 2003 and up 381 from the year-ago quarter. LNL recently announced enhancement of its management and agent sales incentive plans to increase recruiting and training of new agents. LNL Agency had 2,126 producing agents at the end of the quarter compared with 2,004 a year ago.
 
Health Insurance
 
The Health insurance segment accounts for 33% of Torchmark's insurance underwriting margin. The health insurance underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 16% before administrative expenses. The supplemental health products the Company markets and administers are Medicare supplements, limited benefit hospital/surgical policies and dread disease policies. Torchmark markets its health products primarily through two agencies, the UA Independent Agency and the UA Branch Office Agency. At September 30, 2003, Medicare supplements accounted for 65% of the Company's $1.1 billion of annualized health premium in force.
 
 
 
was $255 million, up 2%. While health premium revenue benefited from Medicare supplement rate increases implemented during the last 12 months, the increase in total health premiums was slight because the level of new sales of Medicare supplements and other health products was not enough to overcome policy lapses.
Premium revenue from health insurance
 
was $41 million, a 1% increase. As a percentage of premium, the underwriting margin remained at 16%. While underwriting margins as a percentage of premium was 19% at the UA Independent Agency, the largest writer of health insurance for Torchmark, the overall health margin as a percent of premium was negatively affected by a continued high claims loss ratio in a closed block of LNL cancer business. The closed block is about half of the $178 million of annualized health premium in force at Liberty National.
Health insurance underwriting margin
 
grew 24% to $59 million. Non-Medicare health sales were $41 million, up 47% as both the UA Independent and Branch offices diversify health sales beyond Medicare supplements. Sales of Medicare supplements were $17 million, or 30% of total health sales. Medicare supplement sales declined 10% from the year-ago quarter.
Health insurance sales
 
The UA Independent Agency had health sales of $27 million during the quarter, an increase of 9%. 76% of the quarter's sales were limited benefit supplemental health plans sold to people under age 65, products increasingly in demand as some employers have eliminated or reduced their major-medical type group coverage for employees, and as individually written major-medical plans have become less available. The UA Independent Agency also sold $6 million of Medicare supplements, down 11% from the year-ago quarter.
 
Health sales at the UA Branch Office, the Company's second largest distributor of health insurance, were $21 million, up 30% from the year-ago quarter. This agency had 1,496 producing agents at quarter-end, up from 1,374 three months earlier, indicating recovery from its low of 1,255 a year ago. This agency increased sales of non-Medicare supplements as it also diversified its target market. The sales of these plans accounted for $15 million, up from $5 million from the year-ago quarter. The remainder of this agency's health sales were Medicare supplements, which at $7 million, were down from $9 million for the second quarter of 2003.
 
Annuities
 
Torchmark's annuities are predominantly variable annuity contracts. The company's former distributor has moved many Torchmark variable annuity customers to another carrier following a dispute over the amount of compensation to be paid to the distributor. Torchmark previously announced it would not emphasize the annuity market in the future, preferring the life insurance business. For this quarter, annuities made up only 2% of the Company's insurance underwriting margin.
 
Underwriting margin from the annuity segment was $3 million, up 17% from the year-ago quarter. The separate account assets on the consolidated balance sheet, which contain the investment accounts of the variable annuities and a small amount of investment accounts for variable life policies, were $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter. The separate account assets balance has declined 4% compared with the year-ago quarter, but declined less than 1% since June 30, 2003. The major changes in the balances during the quarter were market appreciation of $34 million and surrenders of $47 million, the lowest amount of surrenders since year-end 2000.
 
INVESTMENTS  comparing the third quarter 2003 with third quarter 2002:
 
Excess Investment Income
 
Excess investment income is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is net investment income on a tax-equivalent basis, (where the yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce the equivalent pretax yield), reduced by required interest. Required interest includes the interest costs credited to net policy liabilities and the net financing costs. Net financing costs include interest on debt and dividends on trust preferred securities, offset by the income from interest rate swap agreements.
 
Excess investment income was $81 million, compared with $74 million, a 9% increase, or a 15% increase on a per-share basis, as detailed in the following chart:
 
 
 
Tax equivalent investment income increased 6% in line with the 7% increase in average invested assets at amortized cost.
 
Financing costs were $7 million, down 17%. The decline was primarily attributable to $1 million increase in cash settlements received from interest rate swap agreements. Under these agreements, the Company's fixed interest expense obligations are converted to floating rates. While the cash settlements from these agreements are reflected in adjusted net operating income, Financial Accounting Standard 133 requires that the Company also record the "market value" of the swaps (i.e. the present value of the estimated future cash settlements) on the balance sheet. The unrealized gain or loss from quarterly change in the market value is recognized as a "non-cash" capital gain or loss, even though Torchmark plans to hold the swaps until the scheduled termination dates, at which time their market value and the cumulative capital gains and losses recorded will be $0. At September 30, 2003, the cumulative realized gains were $18 million, net of tax.
 
Investment Portfolio Composition at September 30, 2003:
 
At September 30, 2003, the market value of Torchmark's fixed maturity portfolio was $8.0 billion, a 13% increase, and $659 million higher than amortized cost of $7.3 billion. This net unrealized gain is composed of $709 million gross unrealized gains, and $50 million gross unrealized losses. At amortized cost, 90% of fixed maturities were rated "investment grade."
 
The fixed income portfolio, which at amortized cost comprised 93% of total invested assets, earned a tax equivalent yield of 7.4%. Acquisitions during the quarter of fixed maturity investments totaled $484 million at cost, with an average annual effective yield of 6.3%, and an average life of 25 years.
 
Torchmark's fixed maturities leverage ratio (fixed maturities to equity) of $2.51 dollars of fixed maturities per $1.00 of equity, is lower than that of most peers, an indication that credit risk in the fixed portfolio is mitigated compared to most peer companies. (Using fixed maturities at amortized cost and excluding the effect of FAS 115 on equity, the ratio is $2.64 to $1.00.)
 
Realized Capital Gains and Losses during the quarter ended September 30, 2003:
 
After tax net realized capital gains from investments, excluding interest rate swaps, were $1.5 million compared with net realized gains of $0.6 million in the year-ago quarter. There were no write-downs of fixed maturity investments due to "other than temporary" impairments during the quarter, nor were there any write-downs of fixed maturities during the year-ago quarter.
 
SHARE REPURCHASEduring the quarter ended September 30, 2003:
 
Torchmark's ongoing share repurchase program resulted in the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of Torchmark Corporation common stock for a total cost of $62 million ($40.22 average cost per share). Year-to-date the Company has repurchased 5.3 million shares, 490,000 shares more than were purchased in the entire year of 2002. At September 30, 2003, there were 113.1 million Torchmark shares outstanding, 113.8 million on a diluted basis.
 
On July 24, 2003, Torchmark announced that its Board of Directors had reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase plan. On that same date Torchmark announced that it was raising its quarterly dividend by 22%, to 11 cents per share, effective for the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION:
 
FAS 115 requires the adjustment of fixed maturities available for sale to fair market value. Without the FAS 115 adjustment, these assets would be reported at amortized cost. This adjustment includes the unrealized changes in fair market value of these assets due primarily to interest rate fluctuations. Torchmark management views the financial ratios and balance sheet information shown below without the impact of the FAS 115 adjustment; therefore, we have presented this data both with and without the FAS 115 adjustment.
