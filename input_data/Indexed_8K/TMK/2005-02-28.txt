Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On February 22, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Torchmark Corporation determined that C.B. Hudson, Mark S. McAndrew and Tony G. Brill would be the participating executives for 2005 in the Torchmark Corporation Annual Management Incentive Plan (the Section 162(m) Plan).
 
On that same date, the Compensation Committee determined that the maximum bonus pool in 2005 for all executives whose combined cash compensation will exceed $150,000 in 2005, including the Section 162(m) Plan participants Hudson, McAndrew and Brill, will be 0.60% of Torchmark's 2005 pre-tax operating income. The Committee also established the respective maximum percentages for the 2005 bonus pool that Messrs. Hudson, McAndrew and Brill, respectively, could receive. The Committee used growth in Torchmark's net operating income per share from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 as the applicable performance criteria for each participant. The Committee established a threshold level of growth in net operating income per share that must be met before any bonus can be paid to a participant; if the threshold is not met, no bonus will be paid. If the threshold is achieved, each participant will be eligible for a bonus equal to his maximum percentage of the bonus pool, subject to the Compensation Committee's discretion regarding any reduction in bonus.
