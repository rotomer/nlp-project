The AmSouth Funds Board of Trustees recently approved, subject to AmSouth Funds shareholder approval, the reorganization of the AmSouth Funds into either existing Pioneer Funds or new Pioneer Funds created specifically to receive the assets of the corresponding AmSouth Fund.
 
Upon receiving the necessary approvals, the AmSouth Funds in the Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan of Liberty National Life Insurance Company ("PS&R Plan") will be reorganized into Pioneer Funds with generally similar investment objectives and strategies and offering similar share classes as the AmSouth Funds currently offered by the PS&R Plan. The reorganization is expected to occur the weekend of September 24, 2005. The last day trades in the AmSouth Funds will be processed is Tuesday, September 20, 2005.
 
Investment fund mapping changes are:
 
 
The change will necessitate a blackout period for the participants in the plan where participants will be temporarily unable to direct or diversify investments in their individual accounts, rollover or transfer assets from these plans to another plan, obtain in-service or hardship withdrawals, obtain plan loans or obtain distributions from the plan. The class of equity securities that will be subject to the blackout period is Torchmark Corporation's common stock.
 
There will be a three business day blackout from September 21, 2005 through September 23, 2005. No trades can be processed during the blackout period. Trading will be available on Monday, September 26, 2005. Notice of this blackout period was sent to all the Plan's participants and beneficiaries as required under Department of Labor regulations, on August 19, 2005 as well as to all members of the Torchmark Board of Directors and all persons subject to Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 16 reporting.
