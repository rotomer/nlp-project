Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Benefit Plans.
 
In a Form 8-K dated August 24, 2005, it was reported that the Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan of Liberty National Life Insurance Company ("PS&R Plan") would be subject to a blackout period due to the reorganization of the AmSouth Funds in the PS&R Plan into either existing Pioneer Funds or new Pioneer Funds created to receive the assets of the corresponding AmSouth Fund.
 
The change necessitated a three business day blackout period from September 21, 2005 through September 23, 2005 for the participants in the plan where participants were temporarily unable to direct or diversify investments in their individual accounts, rollover or transfer assets from this plan to another plan, obtain in-service or hardship withdrawals, obtain plan loans or obtain distributions from the plan. The class of equity securities that was subject to the blackout period was Torchmark Corporation's common stock.
 
The blackout period ended and trading became available at the opening of business on Monday, September 26, 2005. Notice of this blackout period was sent to all the Plan's participants and beneficiaries as required under Department of Labor regulations, on August 19, 2005 as well as to all members of the Torchmark Board of Directors and all persons subject to Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 16 reporting.
 
Questions about Section 306 (a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were addressed to Larry Hutchison at Torchmark Corporation, 3700 South Stonebridge Drive, McKinney, Texas 75070 (972-569-3245) or Carol McCoy at Torchmark Corporation, 2001 Third Avenue South, Birmingham, Alabama 35233 (205-325-4243).
