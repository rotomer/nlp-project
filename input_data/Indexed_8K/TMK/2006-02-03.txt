Item 8.01 Other Events
 
As previously reported in Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q, Liberty National Life Insurance Company, a Torchmark Corporation subsidiary, is a party to a number of lawsuits (both a large number of lawsuits brought by individual plaintiffs and class action litigation with extremely broad class periods and relief sought) involving allegations of racially discriminatory pricing in the sale of insurance to African Americans prior to 1996. The litigation began with the December 8, 1999 filing of , Case No. CV-99-BU-3262-S in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Over 29 race-distinct mortality cases with approximately 2,000 named plaintiffs have been consolidated with the case (Master Case No. 2:02-CV-02741-UWC) and are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, with one pending Alabama Circuit Court case (, Case No. CV-00-684) stayed pending a disposition of the case.

The previously-reported December 5, 2005 trial date fixed by the U.S. District Court for was reset by that Court to January 18, 2006. On January 18, 2006, all parties to submitted a Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement and a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement in that case to the District Court. After a hearing, the District Court entered an Order Preliminarily Approving Proposed Settlement on January 25, 2006. In the Order, the District Court preliminarily approved the Proposed Settlement Agreement; conditionally certified a settlement class defined as "All black Americans who have (or had at the time of the policy's termination) an ownership or other legal interest in an industrial life insurance policy or burial policy issued by Liberty National Life Insurance Company, or one of its former subsidiaries, Service Insurance Company of Alabama, or Burial Service Insurance Company of Alabama on or before January 10, 1966, at a higher rate than similar plans offered to similarly situated white Americans"; certified the class representatives and class counsel; found that the claims in the case were primarily equitable and that the primary relief under the proposed Settlement was injunctive and equitable, with incidental monetary relief in the form of restitution not to exceed $6 million in the aggregate; approved and directed the giving of notice to class members in the manner and form set out in the Proposed Settlement Agreement beginning February 3, 2005; and fixed March 31, 2006 as the date for the fairness hearing. If approved, the Settlement will substantially resolve all class action issues in race-distinct pricing litigation at Liberty National, except for certain consolidated individual claims for mental anguish and punitive damages previously asserted by approximately 2000 individual plaintiffs, which claims are expressly excluded from the proposed settlement. The Company intends to vigorously defend those claims.
