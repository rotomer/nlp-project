Indemnification and Contribution
provided
 
information furnished to the Company and the Trustee by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company or the Trust shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto).
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Capital Trustees, the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person, if any, who controls the Trust or the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company or the Trust to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company and the Trust in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c) If any proceeding (including any government investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company and the Trust in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph.

indemnifying party
 
proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Preferred Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Trust on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Preferred Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Preferred Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company and the Trust on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Trust or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding
 
the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Preferred Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriter's obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several, in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Preferred Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or buyer on behalf of the Trust, the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company or the Trust and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Preferred Securities.
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company and the Trust, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Time (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or on any other exchange on which the Preferred Securities are listed, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the State of New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iii) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or the Trust shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (v) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets, material outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis of such magnitude and severity in its effect on the financial markets of the United States and (b) such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Preferred Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination in Certain Events
10. . If, at the Closing Time, any one or more of the Underwriters shall default in its or their obligations to take up and pay for the Preferred Securities or otherwise fail or refuse to purchase Preferred Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Preferred Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or
Defaulting Underwriters
 
Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Preferred Securities to be purchased on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the non-defaulting Underwriters for the purchase of such Preferred Securities, but if no such arrangements are made, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the aggregate number of Preferred Securities set forth opposite their names in this Agreement bear to the aggregate number of Preferred Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Preferred Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the aggregate number of Preferred Securities which any non-defaulting Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this paragraph by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Preferred Securities without the written consent of such non-defaulting Underwriter. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Preferred Securities and the aggregate number of Preferred Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Preferred Securities, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Preferred Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

Guarantee
I am familiar with and have examined such documents and records as I deemed necessary to render this opinion, including the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Declaration, the Guarantee, the Subscription Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Junior Subordinated Debentures.
In my examination I have assumed but have not independently verified the genuineness of all signatures on all documents examined by me, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or facsimile copies and the authenticity of all such documents.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, I am of the opinion that:
(i) The Company (1) has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and (2) is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
(ii) Each of Liberty National Life Insurance Company, Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company, United American Insurance Company, United
 
Investors Life Insurance Company and American Income Life Insurance Company (collectively the ""), (1) has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and (2) is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; all of the issued shares of capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims.
Significant Subsidiaries
(iii) Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries engaged in the business of insurance are duly organized and licensed as insurance companies or insurance holding companies, as the case may be, in their respective jurisdictions of incorporation (if so required) and, in the case of the Company, each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or authorized to conduct its business, and, in the case of the Significant Subsidiaries engaged in the business of insurance, each other jurisdiction in which such Significant Subsidiary has written 5% or more of the total amount of premiums written by it during each of the last two calendar years, except for any such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so licensed or authorized would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
(iv) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Declaration, the Guarantee, the Subscription Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Junior Subordinated Debentures and the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities as contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement will not contravene any provision of applicable law or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or, to my knowledge, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Declaration, the Guarantee, the Subscription Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Junior Subordinated Debentures except such as have been obtained or may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Preferred Securities.
 
(v) The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Subscription Agreement and the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated thereby will not violate (A) any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Trust that is material to the Trust or (B) or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Trust.
(vi) After due inquiry, I do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company, the Trust or any of their subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company, the Trust or any of their subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and or the Prospectus and are not so described or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described or to be filed as required.

(viii) Each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements, notes, and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference in such documents, as to which I express no opinion) complied as to form when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in all material respects with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
I am licensed to practice law only in the State of Iowa, and, accordingly, I offer no opinion as to the application of decisions or statutory law (including conflict of law rules) of any jurisdiction other than the State of Iowa, the State of Delaware and the United States of America.
This opinion is delivered pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Underwriting Agreement at the request of the Company and is intended solely for your use as Underwriters. As such, it may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose other than for the legal conclusions expressed herein.

We have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished with respect to other matters in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. We have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and with certain officers and employees of, and counsel and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. On the basis of such consideration, review and discussion, but without independent check or verification, except as stated, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement became effective and at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) the General Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iv) the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except in each case we express no belief and make no statement with respect to the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statements of Eligibility and Qualification of the trustees referred to in the Registration Statement.

We have not reviewed any documents other than those identified above in connection with this opinion, and we have assumed that there are no other documents that are contrary to or inconsistent with the opinions expressed herein. Further, except to the extent addressed by our opinion set forth in paragraph 10 below, we express no opinion with respect to, and assume no responsibility for the contents of, the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Common Securities or the Preferred Securities. No opinion is expressed herein with respect to the requirements of, or compliance with, federal or state securities or blue sky laws. As to any fact material to our opinion, other than those assumed, we have relied without independent investigation on the above-referenced documents and certificates and on the accuracy, as of the date hereof, of the matters therein contained.
To the extent our opinion in paragraph 4 relates to the violation of any Delaware law, rule, or regulation, or the requirement for consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body of the State of Delaware, our opinions relate only to laws, rules, regulations and requirements of law that are of general application and that, in our experience, are likely to have application to transactions of the nature herein referenced (and not to laws, rules, regulations or requirements of law that might be implicated by reason of the specific business activities of any of the above-referenced entities).
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, and limited in all respects to matters of Delaware law, it is our opinion that:
1. The Trust has been duly formed and is validly existing in good standing as a statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, 12 Del. C.  3801 et seq. (the "").
Delaware Act
2. Under the Governing Instrument and the Delaware Act, the Trust has the requisite statutory trust power and authority to (A) conduct its business as described in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, (B) execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Subscription Agreement, and perform its obligations thereunder and (C) issue and perform its obligations under the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities.
3. The execution and delivery by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Subscription Agreement, and the performance of its obligations thereunder, have been duly authorized by all requisite statutory trust action on the part of the Trust and each of the Underwriting Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Trust.
4. The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Subscription Agreement and the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated thereby will not violate (A) the Governing Instrument or (B) any applicable Delaware law, rule or regulation. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body of the State of Delaware that has not been obtained is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Debenture Purchase Agreement and the Subscription Agreement or the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities by the Trust.
5. Under the Governing Instrument and the Delaware Act, the issuance of the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities is not subject to preemptive rights.
6. Assuming that the Trust derives no income from or connected with services provided within the State of Delaware and has no assets, activities (other than maintaining the Delaware Trustee and the filing of documents with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware) or employees in the State of Delaware, the Holders of the Preferred Securities (other than Holders of the Preferred Securities, or Persons who are partners or S corporation shareholders for federal income tax purposes in such Holders of the Preferred Securities, who
 
reside or are domiciled in the State of Delaware or who are otherwise subject to income taxation in the State of Delaware) will have no liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware solely as a result of their participation in the Trust, and the Trust will not be liable for any income tax imposed by the State of Delaware.
7. The Governing Instrument constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and the Trustees, enforceable against the Company and the Trustees in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and remedies, (B) general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered and applied in a proceeding in equity or at law), (C) considerations of public policy and the effect of applicable law relating to fiduciary duties and (D) principles of course of dealing or course of performance and standards of good faith, fair dealing, materiality and reasonableness that may be applied by a court to the exercise of rights and remedies.
8. The Preferred Securities have been duly authorized for issuance by the Governing Instrument and, when issued, executed, authenticated, delivered and paid for in accordance with the Governing Instrument and the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and, subject to the qualifications set forth below, non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. Under the Governing Instrument and the Delaware Act, each Holder of Preferred Securities of the Trust, in such capacity, will be entitled to the same limitation on personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; , however, that we express no opinion with respect to the liability of any Holder of Preferred Securities of the Trust who is, was or may become a named Trustee of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we note that, pursuant to Section 11.4 of the Governing Instrument, the Trust may withhold amounts otherwise distributable to a Holder of Preferred Securities of the Trust and pay over such amounts to the applicable jurisdictions in accordance with federal, state and local law and any amount withheld will be deemed to have been distributed to such Holder and that, pursuant to the Governing Instrument, Holders of Preferred Securities of the Trust may be obligated to make payments or provide indemnity or security under the circumstances set forth therein.
provided
9. The Common Securities have been duly authorized for issuance by the Governing Instrument and, when issued, executed, authenticated, delivered and paid for in accordance with the Governing Instrument and the Subscription Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and, subject to the qualifications set forth below, non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. We note that, pursuant to Section 11.4 of the Governing Instrument, the
 
Trust may withhold amounts otherwise distributable to Holders of Common Securities of the Trust and pay over such amounts to the applicable jurisdictions in accordance with federal, state and local law and any amount withheld will be deemed to have been distributed to such Holders and that, pursuant to the Governing Instrument, Holders of Common Securities of the Trust may be obligated to make payments or provide indemnity or security under the circumstances set forth therein.
10. The statements in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus under the captions "SummaryTorchmark Capital Trust III," "Description of TOPrS" and "The Trusts" to the extent such statements address matters of Delaware law are correct statements of such law in all material respects.
This opinion speaks only as of the date hereof and is based on our understandings and assumptions as to present facts, and on our review of the above-referenced documents and the application of Delaware law as the same exist as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update or supplement this opinion after the date hereof for the benefit of any person or entity with respect to any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in facts or law that may hereafter occur or take effect. We understand that the law firms of Maynard, Cooper & Gale, P.C. and Davis Polk & Wardwell wish to rely as to matters of Delaware law on the opinions set forth above in connection with the rendering of its opinion to you dated on or about the date hereof concerning the Underwriting Agreement, and we hereby consent to such reliance. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the opinions herein expressed are intended solely for the benefit of the addressees hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and may not be relied upon by any other person or entity, or for any other purpose, without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special tax counsel for Torchmark Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Torchmark Capital Trust III, a statutory trust organized under the Statutory Trust Act of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), in connection with the sale pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated June 1, 2006 by and among the Company, the Trust and the underwriters (the "Underwriters") named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement") of trust preferred securities (liquidation amount $25 per capital security) (the "Trust Preferred Securities") of the Trust, which will represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
The Trust Preferred Securities will be guaranteed by the Company with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise pursuant to the Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement to be entered into (the "Guarantee Agreement") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities.
In connection with the issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities, the Trust will also issue common securities (liquidation amount $25 per common security) (the "Common Securities"), which will represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
The proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Common Securities are to be used by the Trust to purchase junior subordinated debentures (the "Debentures") to be issued by the Company. The Trust Preferred Securities and the Common Securities are to be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration") to be entered into by and among the Company, as sponsor, Michael J. Klyce, Larry M. Hutchinson and Gary L. Coleman, as regular trustees (the "Regular Trustees"), The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"), The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as property trustee (the "Property Trustee"), and the holders from time to time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Debentures are to be issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture dated as of November 2, 2001 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as amended by the Agreement of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance effective May 5, 2005 by and among the Company, The Bank of New York and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.

We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and the Trust and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers, trustees or other representatives of the Company, the Trust and others, as applicable, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures; the authenticity, validity and enforceability of all documents submitted to us as originals; the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies; the transactions described in the Prospectus Supplement are performed in the manner described therein; full compliance with the terms of the Declaration; that the Declaration will constitute the entire agreement amount the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof; and that the Certificate of Trust will be in full force and effect and will not be amended. In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed by parties other than the Company or the Trust, we have assumed that such parties had, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and that such documents constitute, or will constitute, valid and binding obligations of such parties. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which were not independently established or verified, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers, trustees and other representatives of the Company, the Trust and others.
In rendering our opinion, we have participated in the preparation of the preliminary Prospectus Supplement. Our opinion is conditioned on, among other things, the initial and continuing accuracy of the facts, information, covenants, representations, and assumptions set forth in the documents referred to above and the statements and representations made by the Company and the Trust.
In rendering our opinion, we have considered the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations (proposed, temporary, and final) promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and Internal Revenue Service rulings all as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions. There can be no assurance, moreover, that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of changes of the facts stated or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in applicable law.

Based solely upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, (i) we are of the opinion that the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) we confirm that the statements of law and legal conclusions set forth under the heading "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Prospectus Supplement represent our opinion.
Except as set forth above, we express no opinion to any party as to the tax consequences, whether United States federal, state, local or foreign, of the issuance of the Debentures, the Trust Preferred Securities, the Common Securities or any transactions related to or contemplated by such issuance. In connection with the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2006 (the "Registration Statement"), we are furnishing this opinion to you solely for your benefit and the benefit of investors purchasing the Trust Preferred Securities upon original issuance. This opinion is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to for any other purpose without our written permission.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement and to the reference to Maynard, Cooper & Gale, P.C. therein under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.
