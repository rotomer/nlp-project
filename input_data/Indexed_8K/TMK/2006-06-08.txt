Section 7.3 .
Execution And Authentication
(a) The Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Trust by a Regular Trustee. In case any Regular Trustee of the Trust who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such Regular Trustee before the Certificates so signed shall be delivered by the Trust, such Certificates nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such Certificates had not ceased to be such Regular Trustee; and any Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Trust by such persons who, at the actual date of execution of such Security, shall be the Regular Trustees of the Trust, although at the date of the execution and delivery of the Declaration any such person was not such a Regular Trustee.
(b) One Regular Trustee shall sign the Certificates for the Trust by manual or facsimile signature.
A Preferred Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized signatory of the Property Trustee. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Preferred Security has been authenticated under this Declaration.
Upon a written order of the Trust signed by one Regular Trustee, the Property Trustee shall authenticate the Preferred Securities for original issue.
The Property Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Trust to authenticate Preferred Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Preferred Securities whenever the Property Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Declaration to authentication by the Property Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as the Property Trustee to deal with the Trust, the Sponsor or an Affiliate.
The Preferred Securities and the Property Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 and the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2, each of which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Declaration. Certificates may be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Regular Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof. The Securities may have letters, numbers, notations, other marks of identification or designation or other changes or additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice and such
Section 7.4 .
Form And Dating
 
legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule and agreements to which the Trust is subject, if any (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Trust). The Trust at the direction of the Sponsor shall furnish any such legend not contained in Exhibit A-1 to the Property Trustee in writing. Each Preferred Security Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication. The terms and provisions of the Securities set forth in Annex I and the forms of Securities set forth in Exhibits A-1 and A-2 are part of the terms of this Declaration and, to the extent applicable, the Property Trustee and the Sponsor, by their execution and delivery of this Declaration, expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound thereby.
The Trust shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, State of New York, an office or agency where Preferred Securities not held in book-entry only form may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). Any such Paying Agent shall comply with Section 317(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. The Trust may appoint the Paying Agent and may appoint one or more additional paying agents in such other locations as it shall determine. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Trust may change any Paying Agent without prior notice to any Holder. Any Paying Agent may be removed by the Regular Trustees at any time and a successor Paying Agent may be appointed at any time by the Regular Trustees. The Paying Agent may resign upon 30 days written notice to the Regular Trustees. The Trust shall notify the Property Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Paying Agent not a party to this Declaration. If the Trust fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Paying Agent, the Property Trustee shall act as such. The Trust or any of its Affiliates may act as Paying Agent. The Property Trustee shall initially act as Paying Agent for the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities.
Section 7.5 .
Paying Agent
The Trust shall require each Paying Agent other than the Property Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Property Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of liquidation amounts or Distributions, and will notify the Property Trustee if there are insufficient funds for such purpose. While any such insufficiency continues, the Property Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Property Trustee. The Trust at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Property Trustee and to account for any money disbursed by it. Upon payment over to the Property Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Trust or an Affiliate of the Trust) shall have no further liability for the money. If the Trust or the Sponsor or an Affiliate of the Trust or the Sponsor acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as Paying Agent.
Section 7.6 .
Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust
If a Holder claims that a Security owned by it has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Security is mutilated and is surrendered to the Trust or in the case of the Preferred Securities to the Property Trustee, the Trust shall issue and the Property Trustee shall, upon written order of the Trust, authenticate a replacement Security if the Property Trustee's and the Trust's requirements, as the case may be are met. An indemnity bond must be provided by the Holder which, in the judgment of the Property Trustee and the Sponsor, is sufficient to protect the Trustees, the Sponsor, the Trust or any authenticating agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Trust may charge such Holder for its expenses in replacing a Security.
Section 7.7 .
Replacement Securities
 
The Preferred Securities outstanding at any time are all the Preferred Securities authenticated by the Property Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, and those described in this Section as not outstanding.
Section 7.8 .

If a Preferred Security is replaced pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Property Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Preferred Security is held by a purchaser.
bona fide
If Preferred Securities are considered paid in accordance with the terms of this Declaration, they cease to be outstanding and Distributions on them shall cease to accumulate.
A Preferred Security does not cease to be outstanding because one of the Trustee, the Sponsor or an Affiliate of the Sponsor holds the Security.
The Trust at any time may deliver Preferred Securities to the Property Trustee for cancellation. The Paying Agent shall forward to the Property Trustee any Preferred Securities surrendered to it. The Property Trustee shall promptly cancel all Preferred Securities surrendered and shall dispose of cancelled Preferred Securities in accordance with its customary procedures unless the Trust otherwise directs. The Trust may not issue new Preferred Securities to replace Preferred Securities that it has paid or that have been delivered to the Property Trustee for cancellation.

(vii) the expiration of the term of the Trust on June 1, 2046;
(viii) before the issuance of any Securities, with the consent of all of the Regular Trustees and the Sponsor; or
(ix) with the consent of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities, voting together as a single class;
that, if a claim has been made under the Preferred Securities Guarantee, the Trust shall not dissolve until (x) such claim has been satisfied and the proceeds therefrom have been distributed to the Holders of the Preferred Securities or (y) the Debt Securities have been distributed to the Holders pursuant to Section 8.2. hereof.

Section 8.2 .
Liquidation Distribution upon Dissolution of the Trust
(a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust (a "Liquidation"), the Holders of the Securities on the date of the Liquidation will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders of Securities after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (including, without limitation, by paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust Act), an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount of $25.00 per Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such Liquidation
 
after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (including, without limitation, by paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust Act), Debt Securities in an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the Liquidation Amount of such Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accumulated and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities, shall have been distributed on a Pro Rata basis (subject to Section 8.2(b) below) to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.
If, upon any such Liquidation, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.
(b) The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive distributions upon any such Liquidation Pro Rata with the Holders of the Preferred Securities except that upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or an event of default under the Preferred Securities Guarantee, the Preferred Securities shall have a preference over the Common Securities with regard to such distributions.
Section 9.1 .

(b) Subject to this Article IX, Preferred Securities shall be transferable.
(c) Subject to this Article IX, the Sponsor and any Related Party may only transfer Common Securities to the Sponsor or a Related Party of the Sponsor; PROVIDED THAT, any such transfer shall not violate the Securities Act and is subject to the condition precedent that the transferor obtain the written opinion of independent counsel experienced in such matters that such transfer would not cause more than an insubstantial risk that:
(i) the Trust would not be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust; and
(ii) the Trust would be an Investment Company required to register under the Investment Company Act or the transferee would become an Investment Company required to register under the Investment Company Act.
(d) Each Common Security that bears or is required to bear the legend set forth in this Section 9.1(d) shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the
 
legend set forth in this Section 9.1(d), unless such restrictions on transfer shall be waived by the written consent of the Regular Trustees, and the Holder of each such Common Security, by such security holder's acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by such restrictions on transfer. As used in this Section 9.1(d), the term "transfer" encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition (by operation of law or otherwise) of any such Common Security.
Any certificate evidencing a Common Security shall bear a legend in substantially the following form, unless otherwise agreed by the Regular Trustees (with written notice thereof to the Property Trustee):
THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD UNLESS SUCH OFFER AND SALE ARE REGISTERED UNDER OR ARE EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE DECLARATION REFERRED TO BELOW.

Each Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer shall be canceled by the Regular Trustees. A transferee of a Certificate shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Holder hereunder upon the receipt by such transferee of a Certificate. By acceptance of a Certificate, each transferee shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound by this Declaration.
Section 9.2 .
Transfer of Certificates
The Trustees may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered on the books and records of the Trust as the sole holder of such Certificate and of the Securities represented by such Certificate for purposes of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such Certificate or in the Securities represented by such Certificate on the part of any Person, whether or not the Trust shall have actual or other notice thereof.

Such Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Trust in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of
 
DTC, and no Preferred Security Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Preferred Security Certificate representing such Preferred Security Beneficial Owner's interests in such Global Certificates, except as provided in Section 9.7 below. The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in any such Security in global form shall be effected through the Clearing Agency in accordance with this Declaration and the procedures of the Clearing Agency therefor.
(b) Except as provided below, beneficial owners of a Preferred Security in global form shall not be entitled to have certificates registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificates in definitive form and will not be considered Holders of such Preferred Security in global form.
(c) Any Global Certificate may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Declaration as may be required by the Clearing Agency, by any national securities exchange or by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. as may be required to comply with any applicable law or any regulation thereunder or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system upon which the Preferred Securities may be listed or traded or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Preferred Securities are subject.
(d) Unless and until definitive, fully registered Preferred Security Certificates (the "Definitive Preferred Security Certificates") have been issued to the Preferred Security Beneficial Owners of a Preferred Security in global form pursuant to Section 9.7:
(i) the provisions of this Section 9.4 shall be in full force and effect with respect to such Preferred Securities;
(ii) the Trust and the Trustees shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Declaration (including the payment of Distributions on the Global Certificates and receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of such Preferred Securities and the sole holder of the Global Certificates and shall have no obligation to the Preferred Security Beneficial Owners of such Preferred Securities;
(iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 9.4 conflict with any other provisions of this Declaration, the provisions of this Section 9.4 shall control; and
(iv) the rights of the Preferred Security Beneficial Owners of Preferred Securities in global form shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Preferred Security Beneficial Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. The Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments of Distributions on the Global Certificates to such Clearing Agency Participants. DTC will make book entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants, PROVIDED, that solely for the purposes of determining whether the Holders of the requisite amount of Preferred Securities have voted on any matter provided for in this Declaration, so long as Definitive Preferred Security Certificates have not been issued, the Trustees may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, any written instrument
 
(including a proxy) delivered to the Trustees by the Clearing Agency setting forth the Preferred Securities Beneficial Owners' votes or assigning the right to vote on any matter to any other Persons either in whole or in part.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Declaration (other than the provisions set forth in this Section 9.4(e)), a Preferred Security in global form may not be transferred as a whole except by the Clearing Agency to a nominee of the Clearing Agency or by a nominee of the Clearing Agency to the Clearing Agency or another nominee or by the Clearing Agency or a nominee of the Clearing Agency to a successor Clearing Agency or a nominee of such successor Clearing Agency.

then in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, any Regular Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and deliver, in exchange for, or in lieu of, any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 9.8, the Regular Trustees may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

(a) No Indemnified Person shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Trust or any Covered Person for any loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Declaration or by law, except that an Indemnified Person shall be liable for any such loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of such Indemnified Person's gross negligence (or, in the case of the Property Trustee, except as otherwise set forth in Section 3.9) or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions.
(b) An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Trust and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Trust by any Person as to matters the Indemnified Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Trust, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which Distributions to Holders of Securities might properly be paid.
Section 10.3 .
Fiduciary Duty
(a) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to any other Covered Person, an Indemnified Person acting under this Declaration shall not be liable to the Trust or to any other Covered Person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity (other than the duties imposed on the Property Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act), are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified Person.
 
(b) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein:
(i) whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between any Covered Persons; or
(ii) whenever this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or therein provides that an Indemnified Person shall act in a manner that is, or provides terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Trust or any Holder of Securities,
the Indemnified Person shall resolve such conflict of interest, take such action or provide such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles. In the absence of bad faith by the Indemnified Person, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Indemnified Person shall not constitute a breach of this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or otherwise.
(c) Whenever in this Declaration an Indemnified Person is permitted or required to make a decision:
(i) in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or
(ii) in its "good faith" or under another express standard, the Indemnified Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Declaration or by applicable law.
Section 10.4 .
Indemnification
(a) (i) The Debt Security Issuer shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of NOLO CONTENDERE or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
(ii) The Debt Security Issuer shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(iii) Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Debt Security Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) or (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
(iv) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Debt Security Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Debt Security Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Debt Security Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Preferred Security Holders.
 
(v) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors of the Debt Security Issuer or Preferred Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Debt Security Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
(vi) The Debt Security Issuer or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Debt Security Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
(vii) For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
(viii) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(b) The Debt Security Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Property Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration or the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The provisions of this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration or the resignation or removal of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be.
 
Any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Property Trustee may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Trust, and the Trust and the Holders of Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Declaration in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. No Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee nor the Property Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person, the Delaware Trustee and the Property Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates.

(a) To pay to the Trustees from time to time such compensation for all services rendered by them hereunder as the parties shall agree in writing from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); and
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Declaration (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their respective agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith.
The provisions of this Section 10.6 shall survive the dissolution of the Trust and the termination of this Declaration and the removal or resignation of any Trustee.
No Trustee may claim any lien or charge on any property of the Trust as a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 10.6.

Section 11.2 .
Certain Accounting Matters
(a) At all times during the existence of the Trust, the Regular Trustees shall keep, or cause to be kept, full books of account, records and supporting documents, which shall reflect in detail, each transaction of the Trust. The books of account shall be maintained on the accrual method of accounting, in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. The Trust shall use the accrual method of accounting for the United States federal income tax purposes. The books of account and the records of the Trust shall be examined by and reported upon as of the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust by a firm of independent certified public accountants selected by the Regular Trustees.
(b) The Sponsor shall cause to be prepared and delivered to each of the Holders of Securities, within 90 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Sponsor, annual financial statements of the Sponsor, including a balance sheet of the Sponsor as of the end of such Fiscal Year, and the related statements of income or loss.
(c) The Regular Trustees shall cause to be duly prepared and delivered to each of the Holders of Securities, any annual United States federal income tax information statement, required by the Code, containing such information with regard to the Securities held by each Holder as is required by the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding any right under the Code to deliver any such statement at a later date, the Regular Trustees shall endeavor to deliver all such statements within 30 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust.
(d) The Regular Trustees shall cause to be duly prepared and filed with the appropriate taxing authority, an annual United States federal income tax return, on a Form 1041 or such other form required by United States federal income tax law, and any other annual income tax returns required to be filed by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust with any state or local taxing authority.
The Trust shall maintain one or more bank accounts in the name and for the sole benefit of the Trust; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all payments of funds in respect of the Debt Securities held by the Property Trustee shall be made directly to the Property Trustee Account and no other funds of the Trust shall be deposited in the Property Trustee Account.

Section 11.3 .
Banking
The Trust and the Regular Trustees shall comply with all withholding requirements under United States federal, state and local law. The Trust shall request, and the Holders shall provide to the Trust, such forms or certificates as are necessary to establish an exemption from withholding with respect to each Holder, and any representations and forms as shall reasonably be requested by the Trust to assist it in determining the extent of, and in fulfilling, its withholding obligations. The Regular Trustees shall file required forms with applicable jurisdictions and, unless an exemption from withholding is properly established by a Holder, shall remit amounts withheld with respect to the Holder to applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that the Trust is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any Holder, the amount withheld shall be deemed to be a distribution in the amount of the withholding to the Holder. In
Section 11.4 .
Withholding
 
the event of any claimed over-withholding, Holders shall be limited to an action against the applicable jurisdiction. If the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual Distributions made, the Trust may reduce subsequent Distributions by the amount of such withholding. Furthermore, if withholding is imposed on payments of interest on the Debt Securities, to the extent such withholding is attributable to ownership by a specific Holder of Preferred Securities, the amount withheld shall be deemed a distribution in the amount of the withholding to such specific Holder.
Except as otherwise provided in this Declaration or by any applicable terms of the Securities,

Meetings of the Holders of Securities; Action by Written Consent
(a) Meetings of the Holders of any class of Securities may be called at any time by the Regular Trustees (or as provided in the terms of the Securities) to consider and act on any matter on which Holders of such class of Securities are entitled to act under the terms of this Declaration, the terms of the Securities or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Preferred Securities are listed or admitted for trading. The Regular Trustees shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class if directed to do so by the Holders of at least 25% in liquidation amount of such class of Securities. Such direction shall be given by delivering to the Regular Trustees one or more notices in a writing stating that the signing Holders of Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purpose for which the meeting is to be called. Any Holders of Securities calling a meeting shall specify in writing the Security Certificates held by the Holders of Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and only those Securities specified shall be counted for purposes of determining whether the required percentage set forth in the second sentence of this paragraph has been met.

which the Preferred Securities are listed or admitted for trading, such vote, consent or approval may be given at a meeting of the Holders of Securities. Any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Holders of Securities may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by the Holders of Securities owning not less than the minimum amount of Securities in liquidation amount that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereon were present and voting. Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Holders of Securities entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. The Regular Trustees may specify that any written ballot submitted to the Security Holder for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Trust within the time specified by the Regular Trustees;
(ii) each Holder of a Security may authorize any Person to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Holder of Securities is entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting.

Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Holder of Securities executing it. Except as otherwise provided herein, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the Holders of the Securities were stockholders of a Delaware corporation;
(iii) each meeting of the Holders of the Securities shall be conducted by the Regular Trustees or by such other Person that the Regular Trustees may designate;
(iv) unless the Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration, the terms of the Securities, the Trust Indenture Act or the listing rules of any stock exchange on which the Preferred Securities are then listed or trading, otherwise provides, the Regular Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any Holders of Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote; and
(v) any Preferred Securities that are owned by the Debt Security Issuer or any entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Debt Security Issuer shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of any vote or consent, be treated as if such Preferred Securities were not issued and outstanding.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused these presents to be executed as of the day and year first above written.
 
 
 
Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of June 8, 2006 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration):
1. DESIGNATION AND NUMBER.
(a) PREFERRED SECURITIES. 4,800,000 Preferred Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of One Hundred Twenty Million Dollars ($120,000,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of $25 per Preferred Security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "7.100% Trust Preferred Securities" (the "Preferred Securities"). The Preferred Security Certificates evidencing the Preferred Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such letters, numbers, notations, other means of identification or designation or other changes or additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice and such legends or endorsements required by law, state exchange rule and agreements to which the Trust is subject, if any (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Trust).
(b) COMMON SECURITIES. 148,454 Common Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of Three Million Seven Hundred Eleven Thousand Three Hundred Fifty Dollars ($3,711,350), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $25 per Common Security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "7.100% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities"). The Common Securities Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such letters, numbers, notations, other means of identification or designation or other changes or additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice and such legends or endorsements required by law, state exchange rule and agreements to which the Trust is subject, if any (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Trust).
2. DISTRIBUTIONS.
(a) Distributions payable on each Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 7.100% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee. Distributions in arrears for more than one quarter will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term "Distributions" as used herein includes such interest payable unless otherwise stated. A
 
Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Debt Securities held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed for any full quarterly Distribution period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full quarterly Distribution period for which Distributions are computed, Distributions will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.
(b) Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accumulate from June 8, 2006 and will be payable quarterly in arrears, on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2006, except as otherwise described below. So long as the Debt Security Issuer shall not be in default in the payment of interest on the Debt Securities, the Debt Security Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debt Securities by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Debt Securities for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Debt Securities, PROVIDED THAT no Extension Period shall last beyond the date of maturity of the Debt Securities, and if the Debt Securities are called for redemption before the end of an Extension Period, the Extension Period shall end on the date fixed for redemption or such earlier date as determined by the Trust. As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accumulate with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Debt Security Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; PROVIDED THAT such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 20 consecutive quarters or extend beyond the maturity of the Debt Securities. Payments of accumulated Distributions and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, accumulated interest thereon shall be payable on the Distribution payment date on which the relevant Extension Period terminates and shall be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust at the close of business on the record date next preceding such Distribution payment date. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Debt Security Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. Each Extension Period, if any, will end on an interest payment date for the Debt Securities; such date will also be a Distribution payment date for the Securities. In the event that the Debt Security Issuer exercises its right to defer payment of interest, then during such Extension Period the Debt Security Issuer shall not (a) declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, or (b) make any payment of interest, principal or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities issued by the Debt Security Issuer (including other junior subordinated debt securities) that rank PARI PASSU with or junior in interest to the Debt Securities or make any guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing or with respect to any guarantee by the Debt Security Issuer of the debt securities of any subsidiary of the Debt Security Issuer if such guarantee ranks PARI PASSU with or junior in interest to the Debt Securities (other than (i) as a result of the exchange, redemption or conversion of one class or series of the capital stock of the Debt Security Issuer (or any capital stock of a subsidiary thereof) for another class or series of the capital stock of the Debt Security Issuer or any class or
 
series of the indebtedness of the Debt Security Issuer for any class or series of the capital stock of the Debt Security Issuer, (ii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the capital stock of the Debt Security Issuer pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted into or exchanged for such capital stock, (iii) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks PARI PASSU with or junior to such stock, (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any such plan in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights pursuant thereto, (v) payments under the Preferred Securities Guarantee or under any similar guarantee by the Debt Security Issuer with respect to any trust common or trust preferred securities of its subsidiaries, and (vi) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the capital stock of the Debt Security Issuer in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of an one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, (2) a dividend reinvestment or shareholder stock purchase plan or (3) the issuance of capital stock of the Debt Security Issuer (or securities convertible or exercisable for such capital stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to such Extension Period).
(c) Distributions on the Preferred Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the relevant record dates. While the Preferred Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates which payment dates correspond to the interest payments dates on the Debt Securities. Subject to any applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of the Declaration, each such payment in respect of the Preferred Securities will be made as described under the heading "Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement" in the Prospectus Supplement dated June 1, 2006, to the Prospectus dated April 28, 2006 (together, the "PROSPECTUS") included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Sponsor, the Debt Security Issuer and the Trust. If the Preferred Securities shall not continue to remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Preferred Securities, shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the securities are listed and, if none, shall be fifteen days prior to the relevant payment dates, which payment dates correspond to the record and interest payment dates on the Debt Securities. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record dates as for the Preferred Securities. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Debt Security Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Debt Securities, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distributions payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
 
(d) In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.
3. LIQUIDATION DISTRIBUTION UPON DISSOLUTION. The Debt Security Issuer agrees not to voluntarily dissolve, wind up or liquidate the Trust other than in connection with a Liquidation Distribution whereby after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (including, without limitation, by paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust Act), a Like Amount of Debt Securities will be distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities in liquidation of such Holders' interests in the Trust, within 90 days following notice given to the Holders of the Preferred Securities, subject to the Regular Trustees' receipt of an opinion of independent counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that the Holders will not recognize any income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the dissolution of the Trust and such distribution to Holders of Preferred Securities.
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust (each a "Liquidation"), the Holders of the Securities on the date of the Liquidation will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders of Securities after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (including, without limitation, by paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust Act), an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated Liquidation Amount of $25 per Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such Liquidation after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (including, without limitation, by paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust Act), Debt Securities in an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the aggregate stated Liquidation Amount of such Securities, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate of, and bearing accumulated and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities, shall have been distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.
If, upon any such Liquidation, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.
If the Debt Securities are distributed to the Holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Debt Security Issuer will use its best efforts to have the Debt Securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange as the Preferred Securities were listed on immediately prior to the distribution of the Debt Securities.
 
4. REDEMPTION AND DISTRIBUTION.
(a) The Debt Securities will mature on June 1, 2046, and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 1, 2011. Upon the repayment of the Debt Securities in whole or in part, whether at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise, the proceeds from such repayment or payment shall be simultaneously applied to redeem a Like Amount of Securities at a redemption price per Security equal to the redemption price of the Debt Securities, together with accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to, but excluding, the date of the redemption, payable in cash (the "Redemption Price"). Holders and the Property Trustee will be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice of such redemption.
(b) If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Common Securities and the Preferred Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and the Preferred Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(f) below.
(c) If, at any time prior to June 1, 2011, a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event (each, as defined below, a "Special Event") shall occur and be continuing, the Debt Security Issuer shall have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, to redeem the Debt Securities in whole (not in part) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accumulated and unpaid interest thereon, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event, provided such event is then continuing. Following such redemption, a Like Amount of Securities shall be redeemed by the Trust at the Redemption Price on a Pro Rata basis; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if at the time there is available to the Debt Security Issuer or the Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90 day period, the Special Event by taking some ministerial action, such as filing a form, making an election or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that has no material adverse effect on the Trust, the Debt Security Issuer, the Sponsor or the Holders of the Securities (each, a "Ministerial Action"), then the Debt Security Issuer or the Trust shall pursue such measure in lieu of a redemption. If the Debt Securities are not redeeemed or distributed to the Holders of the Securities in liquidation of the Trust, the Securities shall remain outstanding.
"Tax Event" means that the Regular Trustees shall have received an opinion of independent tax counsel experienced in such matters (a "Tax Opinion") to the effect that as a result of (a) any amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective change) in the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation or (b) any judicial decision, official or administrative pronouncement or action interpreting or applying such laws or regulations (an "Administrative Action"), in each case, by any legislative body, court, governmental authority or regulatory body, irrespective of the manner in which such amendment, change or Administrative Action is made known, or which pronouncement or decision is announced, in each case, on or after, June 1, 2006, there is more than an insubstantial risk that (i) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date thereof, subject to United States federal income tax with respect to income accrued or received on the Debt Securities, (ii) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date thereof, subject to more than a de minimis amount of taxes (other than withholding taxes), duties or other governmental charges, or (iii) interest paid in cash by the Debt Security Issuer to the Trust on the Debt Securities is not, or within 90 days of the date thereof will not be, deductible, in whole or in part, by the Debt Security Issuer for United States federal income tax purposes.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Tax Event shall not include any change in tax law that requires the Debt Security Issuer for United States federal income tax purposes to defer taking a deduction for any original issue discount ("OID") that accrues with respect to the Debt Securities until the interest payment related to such OID is paid by the Debt Security Issuer in cash; PROVIDED, that such change in tax law does not create more than an insubstantial risk that the Debt Security Issuer will be prevented from taking a deduction for OID accruing with respect to the Debt Securities at a date that is no later than the date the interest payment related to such OID is actually paid by the Debt Security Issuer in cash.
"Investment Company Event" means that the Regular Trustees shall have received an opinion of independent counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of the occurrence of a change (including any announced prospective change) in law or regulation or a written change (including any announced prospective change) in interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority on or after June 1, 2006, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Trust is or will be considered an "investment company" that is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
After the date fixed by the Regular Trustees for any distribution of Debt Securities upon dissolution of the Trust: (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), as the record Holder of the Preferred Securities held in global form, will receive a registered certificate or certificates representing the Debt Securities held in global form to be delivered upon such distribution, and (iii) certificates representing Securities held in definitive form, except for certificates representing Preferred Securities held by the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent Debt Securities having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated Liquidation Amount of, with an interest rate identical to the Coupon Rate of, and accumulated and unpaid interest (including Compound Interest and Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture)) equal to accumulated and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Debt Security Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue.
(d) The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accumulated and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all quarterly Distribution periods terminating on or prior to the date of redemption.
(e) (i) Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Debt Securities in exchange for, the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice") will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Debt Securities. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(e), a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, or by such other means suitable to assure delivery of such written notice, to Holders of Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust. No defect in the
 
Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect to any Holder of Securities shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder of Securities.
(ii) In addition to the Redemption/Distribution Notice to be provided to the Holders of Securities pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 4(e), the Debt Security Issuer or the Trust shall give public notice of any such redemption by the issuance of a press release through the services of the Dow Jones Broad Tape, Reuters News Service and Bloomberg News Service.
(f) In the event that fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the particular Preferred Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a Pro Rata basis not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date from the outstanding Preferred Securities not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Property Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate, or if the Preferred Securities are then held in book-entry form, in accordance with the Depositary's customary procedures, it being understood that, in respect of Preferred Securities registered in the name of and held of record by the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) or any nominee, the distribution of the proceeds of such redemption will be made to each Clearing Agency Participant (or Person on whose behalf such nominee holds such securities) in accordance with the procedures applied by such agency or nominee. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the securities registrar for the Securities in writing of the Preferred Securities selected for redemption.
(g) If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued for a redemption if the Debt Securities are redeemed as set out in the Indenture (which notice will be irrevocable), then (i) with respect to Preferred Securities held in book-entry form, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided that the Debt Security Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption of the Debt Securities, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Depositary or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to such Preferred Securities and will give the Depository irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of such Preferred Securities, and (ii) with respect to Preferred Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, provided that the Debt Security Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption of the Debt Securities, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Paying Agent for such Securities funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to such Securities and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities upon surrender of their certificates evidencing such Securities. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given in connection with a redemption and funds deposited as required, then from and after the required date of such deposit, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding Business Day (and without any
 
interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Property Trustee or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the relevant Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accumulate from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of accumulated and unpaid Distributions on the Redemption Date of the Securities will be subject to the rights of Holders on the close of business on the relevant record date in respect of a Distribution Date occurring on or prior to such Redemption Date.
Neither the Regular Trustees nor the Trust shall be required (i) in the event of any redemption in part, to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection for redemption of Securities and ending at the close of business on the earliest date in which the relevant Redemption/Distribution Notice is deemed to have been given to all holders of Securities to be so redeemed or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except for the unredeemed portion of any Securities being redeemed in part.
(h) Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (i) in respect of Preferred Securities held in global form, the Depositary or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), (ii) with respect to Preferred Securities held in definitive form, to the Holders thereof, and (iii) in respect of the Common Securities, to the Holders thereof.
(i) Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Sponsor or any of its subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Preferred Securities by tender, in the open market or otherwise.
5. VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS - PREFERRED SECURITIES.
(a) Except as provided under Sections 5(b) and 7 of this Annex I to the Declaration and as otherwise required by law, the Preferred Securities Guarantee and the Declaration, the Holders of the Preferred Securities will not have voting rights.
(b) Subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities then outstanding, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or may direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the Property Trustee, as holder of the Debt Securities, to (i) exercise the remedies available under the Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities, (ii) waive any past default and its consequences that are waivable
 
under the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debt Securities shall be due and payable, or (iv) in accordance with Section 8 hereof, consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture where consent is required, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing then the holders of 25% of the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities then outstanding may direct the Property Trustee to declare the principal of and interest on the Debt Securities immediately due and payable; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of greater than a majority of the Holders in principal amount of Debt Securities then outstanding (a "Super Majority") affected thereby, the Property Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities then outstanding. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Preferred Securities. Other than with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting any remedy available to the Property Trustee as set forth above, the Property Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Preferred Securities under this paragraph unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that for United States federal income tax purposes, such action will not cause the Trust to be classified as other than a grantor trust. If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debt Securities, any Holder of Preferred Securities may institute a legal proceeding against any person to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Debt Securities. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debt Security Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Debt Securities on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a Holder of Preferred Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal of or interest on the Debt Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified in the Debt Securities. In connection with such Direct Action, the rights of the Holders of Common Securities will be subrogated to the rights of such Holder of Preferred Securities to the extent of any payment made by the Issuer to such Holder of Preferred Securities in such Direct Action. Except as provided in the preceding sentences, the Holders of Preferred Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Debt Securities.
The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Preferred Securities of any notice of default received from the trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities. Such notice shall state that such event of default also constitutes an Event of Default under the Declaration.
Any approval or direction of Holders of Preferred Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Preferred Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Preferred Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Preferred Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be
 
taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents.
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Preferred Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Preferred Securities or to distribute the Debt Securities in accordance with the Declaration and the terms of the Securities.
Notwithstanding that Holders of Preferred Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Preferred Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding.
6. VOTING RIGHTS - COMMON SECURITIES.
(a) Except as provided under Sections 6(b), 6(c) and 7 of this Annex I of the Declaration and as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Common Securities will not have voting rights.
(b) The Holders of the Common Securities are entitled, in accordance with Article V of the Declaration, to vote to appoint, remove or replace any Trustee or to increase or decrease the number of Trustees.
(c) Subject to Section 2.6 of the Declaration and only after any Event of Default with respect to the Preferred Securities has been cured, waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under the Declaration, including (i) directing the time, method, place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debt Security Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Debt Security Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities, (ii) waive any past default and its consequences that are waivable under the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debt Securities shall be due and payable, PROVIDED THAT, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the relevant Super Majority, the Property Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities outstanding. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Preferred Securities. Other than with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting any remedy available to the Property Trustee or the Debt Security Trustee as set forth above, the Property Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Common Securities under this paragraph unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that for United States federal income tax purposes, such action will not cause the Trust to be classified as other than a grantor trust. If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Declaration, any Holder of Common
 
Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against any Person to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Declaration, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other Person.
Any approval or direction of Holders of Common Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Common Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Common Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Common Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents.

Distributions payable on each Preferred Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 7.100% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Preferred Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee. Distributions in arrears for more than one quarter will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term "Distributions" as used herein includes such cash distributions and any such interest payable, including Additional Interest, if any, unless otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Debt Securities held by the Property Trustee and to the extent the Property Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed for any full quarterly Distribution period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full quarterly Distribution period for which Distributions are computed, the amount of Distributions payable will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.
Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Preferred Securities will be cumulative, will accumulate from June 8, 2006 and will be payable quarterly in arrears, on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, of each year, commencing on September 1, 2006, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debt Securities, to Holders of record one (1) Business Day prior to such payment dates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Preferred Securities are not then in book in book-entry only form, such Distributions shall be paid to Holders of record on the date that is fifteen days prior to the relevant payment dates, unless otherwise provided in the Declaration. The Debt Security Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Debt Securities for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters (each an Extension Period"); PROVIDED THAT no Extension Period shall last beyond the date of the maturity of the Debt Securities and if the Debt Securities are called for redemption before the end of an Extension Period, the Extension Period shall end on the date fixed for redemption or such earlier date as determined by the Trust. As a consequence of such deferral, Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accumulate with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Debt Security Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; PROVIDED THAT such Extension Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 20 consecutive quarters or extend beyond the maturity date of the Debt Securities. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Debt Security Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.
The Preferred Securities shall be redeemable as provided in the Declaration.
