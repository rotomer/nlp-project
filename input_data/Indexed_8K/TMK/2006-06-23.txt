Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and delivered to the Representative or to counsel for the Underwriters shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to each Underwriter as to the matters covered thereby.
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and any amounts paid in settlements caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof (including the Rule 430B information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; , , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to losses, claims, damages, liabilities and any amounts paid in settlements caused by
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto).
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person, if any, who controls the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c) If any proceeding (including any government investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities
 
underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriter's obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several, in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or buyer on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Time (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or on any other exchange on which the Securities are listed, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the State of New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iii) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (v) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets, material outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis of such magnitude and severity in its effect on the financial markets of the United States and (b) such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination in Certain Events
10. . If, at the Closing Time, any one or more of the Underwriters shall default in its or their obligations to take up and pay for the Securities or otherwise fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the non-defaulting Underwriters for the purchase of such Securities, but if no such
Defaulting Underwriters
 
arrangements are made, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in this Agreement bear to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representative may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the aggregate principal amount of Securities which any non-defaulting Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this paragraph by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such non-defaulting Underwriter. In any such case either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel itemized in detail reasonably satisfactory to the Company) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
12. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, immediately upon commencement of discussions with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company (and each employee, representative or other agent of the Company) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Company relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.

In addition, the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, on April 28, 2006.
As special counsel, we have examined the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the form of the Securities (collectively, the ""); originals or copies of certain corporate documents of the Company; certificates and statements of public officials, corporate agents, officers of the Company and other persons; and such other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for our opinions set forth below. Also, we have relied upon such certificates and statements of public officials, corporate agents, officers of the Company, and other persons with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters that were not independently established.
Transaction Documents
We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the original documents of all documents submitted to us
 
as certified or photostatic copies or by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission or which we obtained from the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System. With respect to any instrument or agreement executed or to be executed by any party other than the Company, we have assumed, to the extent relevant to the opinions set forth herein, that (i) such party (if not a natural person) has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (ii) such party has full right, power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each instrument or agreement to which it is a party and each such instrument or agreement has been duly authorized (if applicable), executed and delivered by, and, with respect to any party other than the Company, is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement or obligation, as the case may be, of such party.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that:
(i) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(ii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except as (i) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
(iii) The Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, except as (i) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

(v) To our knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency is required under Applicable Laws (as defined below) for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities. As used herein, the term "" means the laws of the State of Alabama, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America which, in our experience are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
Applicable Laws
(vi) The Company is not, and after giving effect to the issuance of the Securities and assuming the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
(vii) The statements (a) in the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes," "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," "Underwriting" and "Description of Securities We May OfferDescription of Debt Securities" and (b) in the Registration Statement in Item 15, in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
We have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished with respect to other matters in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. We have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and with certain officers and employees of, and counsel and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. On the basis of such consideration, review and discussion, but without independent check or verification, except as stated, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement became effective and at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) the General Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iv) the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
 
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except in each case we express no belief and make no statement with respect to the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statements of Eligibility and Qualification of the trustees referred to in the Registration Statement. In expressing the foregoing opinion and belief, we express no opinion or belief as to the conveyance of the General Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
Our role as special counsel to the Company has been limited to matters relating to the issuance and sale of the Securities, including the preparation of the Registration Statement (other than the Incorporated Documents), the General Disclosure Package and Prospectus and the various agreements and documents specifically referred to herein. Accordingly, our opinion is limited to matters specifically set forth herein, and we do not express any opinion concerning the purchase of Securities by the ultimate purchasers thereof.
Any opinion or statement herein which is expressed to be "to our knowledge" or is otherwise qualified by words of like import means that the lawyers currently practicing law with our law firm who have devoted substantive attention to matters for the Company have no current conscious awareness of any facts or information contrary to such opinion or statement. Except to the extent expressly set forth in this opinion, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of any fact, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of any fact should be drawn from our representation of the Company the rendering of this opinion.
We are members of the Bar of the State of Alabama, and this opinion is limited in all respects to the laws of the State of Alabama, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the United States of America. As to all matters governed by the laws of the State of New York with respect to our opinions in paragraphs (ii) and (iii), we are relying on the opinion dated today of your counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell. This opinion is based on the law in effect and the facts and circumstances existing on the date of this opinion. We assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention with respect to the opinions and statements expressed above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.

The Debt Securities are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of February 1, 1987 between the Company and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York (the "Original Trustee"), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture (as so supplemented, the "Indenture") to be entered into by and among the Company, J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (ultimate successor-in-interest to the Original Trustee) and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Prospectus Supplement dated June 20, 2006 (including the Prospectus dated April 28, 2006); (ii) the form of the Debt Securities; (iii) the Indenture; and (iv) the Underwriting Agreement. We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, as applicable, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.

In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed by parties other than the Company, we have assumed that such parties had, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or otherwise, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and that such documents

As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which were not independently established or verified, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.
In rendering our opinion, we have participated in the preparation of the preliminary Prospectus Supplement.

This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of changes of the facts stated or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in applicable law.
Based solely upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we confirm that the statements of law and legal conclusions set forth under the heading "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Prospectus Supplement represent our opinion.
Except as set forth above, we express no opinion to any party as to the tax consequences, whether United States federal, state, local or foreign, of the issuance of the Debt Securities or any transactions related to or contemplated by such issuance. In connection with the sale of the Debt Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2006 (the "Registration Statement"), we are furnishing this opinion to you solely for your benefit and the benefit of investors purchasing the Debt Securities upon original issuance.
