As previously reported in Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q, Liberty National Life Insurance Company and Torchmark Corporation were parties to purported class action litigation filed in the Circuit Court of Choctaw County, Alabama on behalf of all persons who currently or in the past were insured under Liberty cancer policies which were no longer being marketed, regardless of whether the policies remained in force or lapsed ( Case No. CV-2002-009-B). These cases were based on allegations of breach of contract in the implementation of premium rate increases, misrepresentation regarding the premium rate increases, fraud and suppression concerning the closed block of business and unjust enrichment. On December 30, 2003, the Alabama Supreme Court issued an opinion granting Liberty's and Torchmark's petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that the Choctaw Circuit Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction and ordering that Circuit Court to dismiss the action. The plaintiffs then filed their purported class action litigation against Liberty and Torchmark in the Circuit Court of Barbour County, Alabama on December 30, 2003 ( Civil Action No. CV-03-0137). On April 16, 2004 the parties filed a written Stipulation of Agreement of Compromise and Settlement with the Barbour County, Alabama Circuit Court seeking potential settlement of the case. A fairness hearing on the potential settlement was held by the Barbour County Circuit Court on July 15, 2004. After receipt of briefs on certain issues and submission of materials relating to objections to the proposed settlement to the Court-appointed independent special master, the Court reconvened the previously-continued fairness hearing on September 23, 2004. After the September 23, 2004 hearing, the Court, after hearing from the objectors to the potential settlement, ordered the appointment of an independent actuary to report back to the Court on certain issues. The report of the independent actuary was subsequently furnished to the special master and the Court on a timely basis.

On November 22, 2004, the Court entered an order and final judgment in whereby the Court consolidated with , CV-92-021 (previously reported in Forms 10-K and 10-Q) for purposes of the Stipulation of Settlement and certified the class as a new subclass of the class previously certified by that Court in . The Court approved the Stipulation and Settlement and ordered and enjoined Liberty to perform its obligations under the Stipulation. Subject to the Stipulation, Liberty and Torchmark were permanently enjoined from instituting, engaging or participating in, maintaining, authorizing or continuing premium rate increases inconsistent with the Stipulation; failing to implement temporary premium waivers in accordance with the Stipulation; failing to implement the new benefits procedure described in the Stipulation; and failing to implement the special schedules and special provisions of the Stipulation for subclass members who have cancer and are receiving benefits and for subclass members who have no other cancer or medical insurance and/or are not covered by Medicare. The Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims, released the defendants, enjoined subclass members from any further prosecution of released claims and retained continuing jurisdiction of all matters relating to the settlement. In an order issued February 1, 2005, the Court denied the objectors' motion to alter, amend or vacate its earlier final judgment on class settlement and certification. The Companies proceeded to implement the settlement terms. On March 10, 2005, the plaintiffs filed notice of appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court.

In an opinion issued on September 29, 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court voided the Barbour County Circuit Court's final judgment and dismissed the appeal. The Supreme Court held that the Barbour County Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction in to certify the class as a subclass of the class and to enter a final judgment approving the settlement since was filed as an independent class action collaterally attacking rather than being filed in under the Barbour County Court's reserved continuing jurisdiction over that case. Liberty is analyzing the Supreme Court's opinion and evaluating the appropriate course of action in response to that opinion.
