Torchmark Corporation's response to the order posted by the Florida Department of Insurance Regulation on its website June 3, 2009:
The Company believes the action of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation was unwarranted and the Company plans to vigorously respond to the allegations made against it. Liberty National does not illegally discriminate against insurance applicants because of the country of their birth.
The Florida regulator's claims relate to past underwriting practices of the Company with regard to applications submitted by persons who lived in this country, but who were not United States citizens. This legal status results in risk analysis, processing and proof differences which Liberty National believes an insurer lawfully may take into account. The Company believes that the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation has misinterpreted the facts in significant respects, believes that its past and current practices were consistent with Florida law at the time, and is optimistic that a satisfactory resolution of this matter can be achieved through appropriate administrative procedures. We look forward to working with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation toward that end.
