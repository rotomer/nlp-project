On June 25, 2009, Torchmark Corporation ("Torchmark") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named on Schedule A thereto (the "Underwriters"), for the issuance and sale of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Torchmark's 9.25% senior notes due 2019 (the "Notes"). The Notes will be issued under an Indenture dated as of February 1, 1987 (as supplemented, the "Indenture"), between Torchmark and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York (the "Original Trustee"), as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 14, 2001 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 23, 2006 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"), and as proposed to be further supplemented by a Third Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of June 30, 2009 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture"), between Torchmark and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the "Trustee"), the successor-in-interest to the Original Trustee.
Torchmark expects that the net proceeds of this offering will be approximately $296,970,000, after giving effect to the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. The offering of the Notes is being made pursuant to Torchmark's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159910, the "Registration Statement"), which became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 11, 2009, and a related Prospectus Supplement dated June 25, 2009, which was filed with the SEC on June 26, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). Further information concerning the Notes and related matters is set forth in the Prospectus Supplement.
The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by Torchmark. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of Torchmark and the Underwriters against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the sale of the Notes.
The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 9.25% per annum. Interest on the Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2019.
The Indenture provides that if an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the affected series issued under the Indenture then outstanding may declare the principal amount of all the debt securities and interest, if any, accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately. An event of default with respect to the Notes is defined in the Indenture as being (i) Torchmark's failure to pay any installment of interest on the Notes for 30 days after the date payment is due, (ii) a default in the payment of any principal on the Notes when due at maturity, by declaration of acceleration or otherwise, (iii) Torchmark's failure to perform any of the covenants or the breach of a covenant or warranty in the Indenture applicable to the Notes which shall not have been remedied within a period of 60 days after receipt of written notice from the trustee or holders of at least 10% aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes that performance or cure of breach was required, (iv) certain events involving Torchmark's bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, (v) a default under any other indebtedness of Torchmark if Torchmark fails to pay a principal amount due in excess of $10,000,000 or if a principal amount in excess of $10,000,000 is declared due prior to the date it would have otherwise been due, and (vi) Torchmark's failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on any Note called for redemption on a redemption date.
The Notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Torchmark's option, at any time or from time to time at a make-whole premium, upon notice mailed to each holder of the Notes at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. The "make-whole premium" redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined in the Third Supplemental Indenture) on such Notes discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Third Supplemental Indenture) plus 75 basis points. Accrued interest will be paid to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The foregoing description is a summary of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Third Supplemental Indenture and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement and the other documents relating to this transaction that are attached as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which are incorporated herein by reference.
From time to time, certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, commercial banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Torchmark. For example, affiliates of the Underwriters are participants in Torchmark's credit facility. The Underwriters and/or their affiliates have received, and may receive, customary fees, expenses and commissions for these transactions. In addition, affiliates of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. hold commercial paper issued by Torchmark.
The trustee for the issuance of the Notes is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and any amounts paid in settlements caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof (including the Rule 430B information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; , , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to losses, claims, damages, liabilities and any amounts paid in settlements caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto).
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person, if any, who controls the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c) If any proceeding (including any government investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriter's obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several, in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or buyer on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Time (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or on any other exchange on which the Company's common stock is listed, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the State of New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iii) trading of any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (v) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets, material outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or
Termination in Certain Events
 
international calamity or crisis of such magnitude and severity in its effect on the financial markets of the United States and (b) such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
10. . If, at the Closing Time, any one or more of the Underwriters shall default in its or their obligations to take up and pay for the Securities or otherwise fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and the non-defaulting Underwriters for the purchase of such Securities, but if no such arrangements are made, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in this Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the aggregate principal amount of Securities which any non-defaulting Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this paragraph by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such non-defaulting Underwriter. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
Defaulting Underwriters

11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses

I am familiar with and have examined such documents and records as I deemed necessary to render this opinion, including the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities.
In my examination I have assumed but have not independently verified the genuineness of all signatures on all documents examined by me, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or facsimile copies and the authenticity of all such documents.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, I am of the opinion that:

(ii) Each of Liberty National Life Insurance Company, Globe Life And Accident Insurance Company, United American Insurance Company, United Investors Life Insurance Company and American Income Life Insurance Company (collectively the ""), (1) has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and (2) is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; all of the issued shares of capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims.
Significant Subsidiaries
(iii) Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries engaged in the business of insurance are duly organized and licensed as insurance companies or insurance holding companies, as the case may be, in their respective jurisdictions of incorporation (if so required) and, in the case of the Company, each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or authorized to conduct its business, and, in the case of the Significant Subsidiaries engaged in
 
the business of insurance, each other jurisdiction in which such Significant Subsidiary has written 5% or more of the total amount of premiums written by it during each of the last two calendar years, except for any such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so licensed or authorized would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
(iv) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities and the issuance and sale of the Securities as contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement will not contravene any provision of applicable law or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or, to my knowledge, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities except such as have been obtained or may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities.

by reference in such documents, as to which I express no opinion) complied as to form when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in all material respects with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
I am licensed to practice law only in the State of Iowa, and, accordingly, I offer no opinion as to the application of decisions or statutory law (including conflict of law rules) of any jurisdiction other than the State of Iowa, the State of Delaware and the United States of America.
This opinion is delivered pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Underwriting Agreement at the request of the Company and is intended solely for your use as Underwriters.

The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act; the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reference to Rule 424(b)(8)); the Final Term Sheet has been filed with the Commission in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the best of our knowledge, threatened by the Commission. In addition, the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, on June 11, 2009.
As special counsel, we have examined the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the form of the Securities (collectively, the ""); originals or copies of certain corporate documents of the Company; certificates and statements of public officials, corporate agents, officers of the Company and other persons; and such other documents as we have deemed
Transaction Documents
 
necessary as a basis for our opinions set forth below. Also, we have relied upon such certificates and statements of public officials, corporate agents, officers of the Company, and other persons with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters that were not independently established.
We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission or which we obtained from the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System. With respect to any instrument or agreement executed or to be executed by any party other than the Company, we have assumed, to the extent relevant to the opinions set forth herein, that (i) such party (if not a natural person) has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (ii) such party has full right, power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each instrument or agreement to which it is a party and each such instrument or agreement has been duly authorized (if applicable), executed and delivered by, and, with respect to any party other than the Company, is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement or obligation, as the case may be, of such party.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that:
(i) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(ii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that we express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law and (y) applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto.
(iii) The Securities have been duly authorized for issuance by the Company and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally,
 
concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Securities are to be issued, provided that we express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law and (y) applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto.
(iv) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities will not contravene any provision of applicable law or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company.
(v) To our knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency is required under Applicable Laws (as defined below) for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities. As used herein, the term "" means the laws of the State of Alabama, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America which, in our experience are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
Applicable Laws
(vi) The Company is not, and after giving effect to the issuance of the Securities and assuming the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
(vii) The statements (a) in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes," "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Description of Securities We May OfferDescription of Debt Securities" and (b) in the Registration Statement in Item 15, in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
We have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished with respect to other matters in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. We have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and with certain officers and employees of, and counsel and independent registered public accounting firm for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. On the basis of such consideration, review and discussion, but without independent check or verification, except as stated, no
 
facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement became effective and at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) the General Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iv) the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except in each case we express no belief and make no statement with respect to the financial statements and financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statements of Eligibility and Qualification of the trustees referred to in the Registration Statement. In expressing the foregoing opinion and belief, we express no opinion or belief as to the conveyance of the General Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
Our role as special counsel to the Company has been limited to matters relating to the issuance and sale of the Securities, including the preparation of the Registration Statement (other than the Incorporated Documents), the General Disclosure Package and Prospectus and the various agreements and documents specifically referred to herein. Accordingly, our opinion is limited to matters specifically set forth herein, and we do not express any opinion concerning the purchase of Securities by the ultimate purchasers thereof.
Any opinion or statement herein which is expressed to be "to our knowledge" or is otherwise qualified by words of like import means that the lawyers currently practicing law with our law firm who have devoted substantive attention to matters for the Company have no current conscious awareness of any facts or information contrary to such opinion or statement. Except to the extent expressly set forth in this opinion, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of any fact, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of any fact should be drawn from our representation of the Company the rendering of this opinion.
We are members of the Bar of the State of Alabama, and this opinion is limited in all respects to the laws of the State of Alabama, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the United States of America. As to all matters governed by the laws of the State of New York with respect to our
 
opinions in paragraphs (ii) and (iii), we are relying on the opinion dated today of your counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. This opinion is based on the law in effect and the facts and circumstances existing on the date of this opinion. We assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention with respect to the opinions and statements expressed above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.
This opinion is being delivered to you at the request of the Company in connection with the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, and may not be relied on by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement dated June 25, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Torchmark Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 9.25% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of February 1, 1987 between the Company and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York (the "Original Trustee"), as supplemented by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 14, 2001, a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 23, 2006 and a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 30, 2009 (as supplemented, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (successor in interest to the Original Trustee), as trustee under the Indenture (the "Trustee").
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
 
We have also reviewed the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159910) (including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company and have participated in the preparation of the preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 25, 2009 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Securities, the free writing prospectus dated June 25, 2009 set forth in Schedule B to the Underwriting Agreement relating to the pricing information and the prospectus supplement dated June 25, 2009 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The registration statement became effective under the Act and the Indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on June 11, 2009 pursuant to Rule 462(e). The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement", and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated June 11, 2009 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus". The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus".
We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR") or the Interactive Data Electronic Applications system ("IDEA"), except for required EDGAR or IDEA formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in the Underwriting Agreement.
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that we express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law and (y) applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto.
 
2. The Securities, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Securities are to be issued, provided that we express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law and (y) applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
We have considered the statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes", "Description of Securities We May OfferDescription of Debt Securities" and "Underwriting" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture, the Securities and the Underwriting Agreement. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, we have assumed that each party to the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the Securities (the "Documents") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, provided that we make no such assumption to the extent that we have specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company, and (ii) each Document (other than the Underwriting Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto, (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
 
We are members of the Bars of the States of New York and California and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, except that we express no opinion as to any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
This opinion is rendered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Securities from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent, except that Maynard, Cooper & Gale, P.C., special counsel to the Company, may rely on our opinions in paragraphs 1 and 2 as to matters governed by the laws of the State of New York in rendering their opinion to be delivered pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement dated June 25, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Torchmark Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 9.25% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Securities").
We have also reviewed the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159910) (including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company and have participated in the preparation of the preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 25, 2009 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Securities, the free writing prospectus dated June 25, 2009 set forth in Schedule B to the Underwriting Agreement relating to the pricing information and the prospectus supplement dated June 25, 2009 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement", and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated June 11, 2009 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus". The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the free writing prospectus set forth in Schedule B to the Underwriting Agreement for the Securities are
 
hereinafter called the "Disclosure Package". The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus".
We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR") or the Interactive Data Electronic Applications system ("IDEA"), except for required EDGAR or IDEA formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or quantitative information. Furthermore, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes", "Description of Securities We May OfferDescription of Debt Securities" and "Underwriting"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to you in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and with certain officers and employees of, and counsel and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
(i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
 
(ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities:
