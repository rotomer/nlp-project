Exhibit 99.1
 
 
McKinney, TX, July 27, 2009Torchmark Corporation (NYSE: TMK) reported today that for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, net income was $1.38 per share compared with $1.47 per share for the year-ago quarter. Net operating income for the quarter was $1.53 per share, a 6% per share increase compared with $1.44 per share for the year-ago quarter.
Reconciliations between net income and net operating income are shown in the Financial Summary below.
FINANCIAL SUMMARY
Net operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, has long been consistently used by Torchmark's management to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and nonrecurring items which are included in net income. Management believes that an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company's business.
 
 
INSURANCE OPERATIONS  comparing the second quarter 2009 with second quarter 2008:
Life insurance accounted for 70% of the Company's insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 62% of total premium revenue.
Health insurance, excluding Medicare Part D, accounted for 24% of Torchmark's insurance underwriting margin for the quarter and 31% of total premium revenue. Medicare Part D accounted for 3% of insurance underwriting margin and 7% of total premium revenue.
Net sales of life insurance increased 12%, while health sales, excluding Medicare Part D, fell 48%.
Insurance Premium Revenue
 
Insurance Underwriting Income
Insurance underwriting margin is management's measure of profitability of its life, health and annuity segments' underwriting performance, and consists of premiums less policy obligations, commissions and other acquisition expenses.
Insurance underwriting income is the sum of the insurance underwriting margins of the life, health and annuity segments, plus other income, less insurance administrative expenses. It excludes the investment segment, parent company expense and income taxes.

UA Independent Agency
is distributed by Direct Response and the UA agencies. Second quarter premium revenue was $45 million, same as the year-ago quarter. Underwriting margin for the second quarter 2009 was $5 million, same as the year-ago quarter.
Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan
For GAAP reporting, Medicare Part D premiums are recognized evenly throughout the year when they become due, and benefit costs are recognized when the costs are incurred. Due to the design of the product, premiums are evenly distributed throughout the year, but benefit costs are much higher earlier in the year. As a result, under GAAP, benefit costs can exceed premiums in the first part of the year but be less than premiums during the remainder of the year. For net operating income purposes, Torchmark defers excess benefits incurred in earlier interim periods to later periods in order to more closely match the benefit cost with the associated revenue. For the full year, the total premiums and benefits will be the same under this alternative method as they are under GAAP. The Company reports this difference between GAAP and management's non-GAAP disclosures, net of tax, as a reconciling item for the interim
 
periods in the Financial Summary shown on page 1 of this release. A chart reconciling the Company's non-GAAP financial presentation to a GAAP presentation may be viewed at www.torchmarkcorp.com on the Investor Relations page at Financial Reports.
consist of variable and fixed annuity contracts. Underwriting margin from the annuity segment was $5 million, up from $1 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase is due primarily to the effects of fluctuations in the equity markets on variable annuity account values. The variable annuity business is Torchmark's only business where margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets.
Torchmark Annuities
Administrative Expenses were $39.8 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter, primarily the result of an increase in pension expense.
INVESTMENTS
Excess Investment Income  comparing the second quarter 2009 with the second quarter 2008:
Management uses excess investment income as the measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is net investment income reduced by required interest. Required interest includes interest credited to net policy liabilities and interest on debt.
 
Net investment income was flat, while average invested assets increased 2%. The income remained level because more cash was held in short term investments than invested in bonds in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the year-ago quarter. In addition, the yield on short-term investments was .2% compared to 1.8% in the year-ago quarter. Interest credited on net policy liabilities increased 11% while the related liabilities increased 8%.
 
Investment Portfolio
The composition of the investment portfolio at June 30, 2009 is as follows:
 
The investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime mortgages. Torchmark has no counterparty risk as it is not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivatives contracts and does not participate in securities lending.
Fixed maturities at amortized cost by asset class are as follows:
 
The market value of Torchmark's fixed maturity portfolio was $8.1 billion; $1.4 billion lower than amortized cost of $9.4 billion. The $1.4 billion of net unrealized losses compares to $2.2 billion at March 31, 2009. Management believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to general economic conditions. Due to its strong liquidity position, Torchmark does not intend to sell the securities and plans to hold these investments to maturity.
Below investment grade bonds, at amortized cost, were $1.4 billion, or 15% of fixed maturities, compared to $1.3 billion, or 13% at 3/31/09. The increase in below investment grade bonds is due to rating agency downgrades of bonds that were previously investment grade.
The fixed maturity portfolio earned an annual effective yield of 6.97% during the second quarter of 2009, same as the year-ago quarter.
 
Acquisitions of fixed maturity investments during the quarter totaled $246 million at cost. Comparable information for acquisitions of fixed maturity investments is as follows:
 
Realized Capital Losses on Investmentsduring the quarter ended June 30, 2009:
Torchmark incurred a $38.1 million charge to earnings due to impairments and had $8.5 million of realized gains from dispositions during the quarter ended June 30, 2009. This resulted in a net capital loss of $29.6 million ($11.8 million after tax). The tax benefit exceeded 35% of the net capital loss because of a change in estimated deferred tax valuation allowance due primarily to increases in unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. Year-to-date, net capital losses have been $75.9 million ($52.8 million after tax).
LIQUIDITY/CAPITAL
Torchmark's operations consist primarily of writing basic protection life and supplemental health insurance policies which generate strong and stable cash flows. Less than 1% of revenue arises from asset accumulation products where margins are significantly impacted by changes in the equity markets. Capital at the insurance companies continues to be sufficient to support current operations.
EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009:
Torchmark projects that for the year ending December 31, 2009, net operating income per share will range from $5.93 to $6.08, assuming no more share repurchases for the year.
