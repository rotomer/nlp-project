McKinney, TX, July 28, 2010Torchmark Corporation (NYSE: TMK) reported today that for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, net income was $1.53 per share compared with $1.38 per share for the year-ago quarter. Net operating income for the quarter was $1.58 per share, a 3% per share increase compared with $1.53 per share for the year-ago quarter.
Reconciliations between net income and net operating income are shown in the Financial Summary below.
FINANCIAL SUMMARY
Net operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, has long been consistently used by Torchmark's management to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and nonrecurring items which are included in net income. Management believes that an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company's business.

Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan
For GAAP reporting, Medicare Part D premiums are recognized evenly throughout the year when they become due, and benefit costs are recognized when the costs are incurred. Due to the design of the product, premiums are evenly distributed throughout the year, but benefit costs are much higher earlier in the year. As a result, under GAAP, benefit costs can exceed premiums in the first part of the year but be less than premiums during the remainder of the year. For net operating income purposes, Torchmark defers excess benefits incurred in earlier interim periods to later periods in order to more closely match the benefit cost with the associated revenue. For the full year, the total premiums and benefits will be the same under this alternative method as they are under GAAP. The Company reports this difference between GAAP and management's non-GAAP disclosures, net of tax, as a reconciling item for the interim periods in the Financial Summary shown on page 1 of this release. A chart reconciling the Company's non-GAAP financial presentation to a GAAP presentation may be viewed at www.torchmarkcorp.com on the Investor Relations page at Financial Reports.
 
consist of variable and fixed annuity contracts. Underwriting loss from the annuity segment was $1 million compared to a $5 million gain for the year-ago quarter. The change is due primarily to the effects of fluctuations in the equity markets on variable annuity account values. The variable annuity business is Torchmark's only business where margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets.

INVESTMENTS
Excess Investment Income  comparing the second quarter 2010 with the second quarter 2009:
Management uses excess investment income as the measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is net investment income reduced by required interest. Required interest includes interest on net policy liabilities and interest on debt.
 
Net investment income was up 9%, while average invested assets increased 10%. Interest credited on net policy liabilities increased 8%, in line with the 8% increase in the related liabilities. Interest on debt increased 26% due to higher average long-term debt outstanding and a higher average interest rate resulting from the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt at the end of the second quarter of 2009.
Investment Portfolio
The composition of the investment portfolio at June 30, 2010 is as follows:
 
 
Fixed maturities at amortized cost by asset class are as follows:
 
 
The market value of Torchmark's fixed maturity portfolio was $10.9 billion; $178 million higher than amortized cost of $10.7 billion. The $178 million net unrealized gain compares to net unrealized losses of $173 million at March 31, 2010, and $1.4 billion a year ago.
The investment portfolio contains no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by sub-prime mortgages. Torchmark has no counterparty risk as it is not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivatives contracts and does not participate in securities lending.
At amortized cost, 92% of fixed maturities (94% at market value) were rated "investment grade."
The fixed maturity portfolio earned an annual effective yield of 6.75% during the second quarter of 2010, compared to 6.97% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is due primarily to the portfolio restructuring that took place in the third quarter of 2009 and lower new money yields.
Acquisitions of fixed maturity investments during the quarter totaled $377 million at cost. Comparable information for acquisitions of fixed maturity investments is as follows:
 
 
Realized Capital Losses on Investments  during the quarter ended June 30, 2010:
Torchmark had a net capital loss of $5.5 million ($3.6 million after tax) resulting from dispositions and extinguishment of debt during the quarter ended June 30, 2010. Year-to-date, the Company had net capital gains of $2.3 million ($1.5 million after tax).
SHARE REPURCHASE  during the quarter ended June 30, 2010:
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of Torchmark Corporation common stock at a total cost of $63.2 million at an average price per share of $51.86. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the Company repurchased 675,000 shares at a total cost of $33.1 million at an average price per share of $48.96.
LIQUIDITY/CAPITAL:
Torchmark's operations consist primarily of writing basic protection life and supplemental health insurance policies which generate strong and stable cash flows. Less than 1% of revenue arises from asset accumulation products where margins are significantly impacted by changes in the equity markets. Capital at the insurance companies continues to be more than sufficient to support current operations. In addition, the parent company held $300 million liquid assets of cash at June 30, 2010.
EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010:
Torchmark projects that for the year ending December 31, 2010, net operating income per share will range from $6.25 to $6.30 assuming no further share repurchases other than those mentioned above.
