If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or a Fronting Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or a Fronting Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Fronting Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Fronting Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Each of the Lenders hereby expressly agrees to reimburse the Borrower promptly on demand for all amounts that the Borrower is required to pay to the Administrative Agent as a result of such Lender's failure, plus all related and reasonable costs and expenses. The Administrative Agent agrees that the Borrower shall have each of the rights and remedies available to the Administrative Agent with respect to obtaining reimbursement from Lenders.
Section 3.01(h)
Section 3.01(h)
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (which notice shall state in reasonable detail the reasons therefor together with a statement that other borrowers with similar Eurodollar Rate Loans are being treated similarly), any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
3.02 Illegality.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(b) . If any Lender or any Fronting Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such Fronting Bank or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or such Fronting Bank's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Fronting Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Fronting Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Fronting Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Fronting Bank or such Lender's or such Fronting Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Fronting Bank's policies and the policies of such
Capital Requirements

Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Fronting Bank to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Fronting Bank's right to demand such compensation, that the Loan Parties shall not be required to compensate a Lender or such Fronting Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such Fronting Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Loan Parties of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Fronting Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

It is
 
agreed that the Borrower's liability hereunder is independent of any other guaranties or other obligations at any time in effect with respect to the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof, and that the Borrower's liability hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence, validity, enforcement or non-enforcement of any such other guaranties or other obligations or any provision of any Applicable Law purporting to prohibit payment by TMK of the Guaranteed Debt in the manner agreed upon among the Guaranteed Parties and TMK.
(d) . Credit may be granted or continued from time to time by the L/C Administrator or the Lenders to TMK without notice to or authorization from the Borrower regardless of TMK's financial or other condition at the time of any such grant or continuation. No Guaranteed Party shall have an obligation to disclose or discuss with the Borrower its assessment of the financial condition of TMK.
Dealings with TMK
(e) . Until the irrevocable payment in full of the Obligations and termination of all commitments which could give rise to any Obligation, the Borrower shall have no right of subrogation with respect to the Guaranteed Debt and hereby waives any right to enforce any remedy which any Guaranteed Party now has or may hereafter have against TMK, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Debt, and the Borrower hereby waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to any Guaranteed Party to secure payment of the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof or any other liability of TMK to any Guaranteed Party. Upon such irrevocable payment and termination, TMK shall indemnify the Borrower for the full amount of any payment made by the Borrower under this Guaranty and the Borrower shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment.
Subrogation
(f) . The Borrower authorizes the Guaranteed Parties to take any action or exercise any remedy with respect to any non-Cash Collateral from time to time securing the Guaranteed Debt, which the Guaranteed Parties in their sole discretion shall determine, without notice to the Borrower. In the event the Guaranteed Parties in their sole discretion elect to give notice of any action with respect to any non-Cash Collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt or any part thereof, ten (10) days' written notice mailed to the Borrower by ordinary mail at the address set forth in shall be deemed reasonable notice of any matters contained in such notice. The Borrower consents and agrees that no Guaranteed Party shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the Borrower or against or in payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Debt.
Collateral
Schedule 10.02
(g) . In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Debt is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of TMK, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Borrower forthwith upon demand by a Guaranteed Party. The Borrower further agrees that, to the extent that TMK makes a payment or payments to any of the Guaranteed Parties on the Guaranteed Debt, or any Guaranteed Party receives any proceeds of collateral securing the Guaranteed Debt, which payment or receipt of proceeds or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be returned or repaid to TMK, its estate, trustee, receiver, debtor in possession or any other party, including, without limitation, the
Rights to Payments, Etc
 
Borrower, under any insolvency or bankruptcy Law, state or federal Law, common Law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment, return or repayment, the obligation or part thereof which has been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the date when such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction occurred.
(h) . No delay on the part of any Guaranteed Party in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by any Guaranteed Party of any right, power or remedy shall preclude any further exercise thereof; nor shall any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of any of the terms or provisions of this Guaranty be binding upon any Guaranteed Party, except as expressly set forth in writing duly signed and delivered on the L/C Administrator's and the Lenders' behalf by the Administrative Agent. The failure by any Guaranteed Party at any time or times hereafter to require strict performance by TMK or the Borrower of any of the provisions, warranties, terms and conditions contained in any promissory note, security agreement, agreement, guaranty, instrument or document now or at any time or times hereafter executed pursuant to the terms of, or in connection with, this Agreement by TMK or the Borrower and delivered to the Guaranteed Parties shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of any Guaranteed Party at any time or times hereafter to demand strict performance thereof, and such right shall not be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge of any Guaranteed Party, their agents, officers or employees, unless such waiver is contained in an instrument in writing duly signed and delivered on the L/C Administrator's, Fronting Banks' and the Lenders' behalf by the Administrative Agent. No waiver by any Guaranteed Party of any default shall operate as a waiver of any other default or the same default on a future occasion, and no action by any Guaranteed Party permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair any Guaranteed Party's rights or powers, or the obligations of the Borrower under this Guaranty. Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount of any Guaranteed Debt owing by TMK to any Guaranteed Party shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower irrespective of whether the Borrower was a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made.
No Waiver
(i) . In addition to and without limitation of any rights, powers or remedies of the Guaranteed Parties under Applicable Law, any time after maturity of the Guaranteed Debt, whether by acceleration or otherwise, the Guaranteed Parties may, in their sole discretion, with notice after the fact to the Borrower and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply toward the payment of the Guaranteed Debt (i) any indebtedness due to or to become due from any of the Guaranteed Parties to the Borrower, and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to the Borrower (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) at any time held by or coming into the possession of any of the Guaranteed Parties or any Lender whether for deposit or otherwise.
Setoff
(j) . Wherever possible, each provision of this shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any provision of this shall be prohibited by or invalid under such Law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this .
Severability
Section 10.19
Section 10.19
Section 10.19
 
(k) . It is understood that while the amount of the Guaranteed Debt guaranteed hereby is not limited, if in any action or proceeding involving any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency or other Law affecting the rights of creditors generally, this Guaranty would be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of the aggregate liability under this Guaranty with respect to the Borrower, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the aggregate amount of such liability shall, with respect to the Borrower, without any further action of the Guaranteed Parties, be automatically limited and reduced with respect to the Borrower to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding. The obligations of the Borrower under this shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
