Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
McKinney, TX, October 26, 2011Torchmark Corporation (NYSE: TMK) reported today that for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, net income was $1.30 per share compared with $0.94 per share for the year-ago quarter. Net operating income for the quarter was $1.22 per share, a 13% per share increase compared with $1.08 per share for the year-ago quarter.
Reconciliations between net income and net operating income are shown in the Financial Summary below.
FINANCIAL SUMMARY
Net operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, has long been consistently used by Torchmark's management to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and nonrecurring items which are included in net income. Management believes that an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company's business.

Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan
For GAAP reporting, Medicare Part D premiums are recognized evenly throughout the year when they become due, and benefit costs are recognized when the costs are incurred. Due to the design of the product, premiums are evenly distributed throughout the year, but benefit costs are much higher earlier in the year. As a result, under GAAP, benefit costs can exceed premiums in the first part of the year but be less than premiums during the remainder of the year. For net operating income purposes, Torchmark defers excess benefits incurred in earlier interim periods to later periods in order to more closely match the benefit cost with the associated revenue. For the full year, the total premiums and benefits will be the same under this alternative method as they are under GAAP. The Company reports this difference between GAAP and management's non-GAAP disclosures, net of tax, as a reconciling item for the interim periods in the Financial Summary shown on page 2 of this release. A chart reconciling the Company's non-GAAP financial presentation to a GAAP presentation may be viewed at on the Investor Relations page at Financial Reports.

INVESTMENTS
Excess Investment Income  comparing the third quarter 2011 with the third quarter 2010:
Management uses excess investment income as the measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is net investment income reduced by required interest. Required interest includes interest on net policy liabilities and interest on debt.
 
Both net investment and average invested assets increased 3%. The impact of the lower new money yield was offset by the fact that we held less cash than last year. Interest on net policy liabilities increased 8%, while the related liabilities increased 6%.
