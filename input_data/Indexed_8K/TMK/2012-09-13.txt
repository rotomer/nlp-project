This Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A (this "Amendment") amends the Current Report on Form 8-K of Torchmark Corporation ("Torchmark" or the "Company") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2012 (the "Original Form 8-K"), in which Torchmark revised certain items in Torchmark's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report") based on Torchmark's retrospective adoption, effective January 1, 2012, of Accounting Standards Update 2010-26, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts." The revised sections of the Annual Report were set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to the Original Form 8-K (the "Original Exhibit 99.1").
Torchmark is filing this Amendment solely to delete disclosures of its credit ratings that appeared on page 50 of the Original Exhibit 99.1. These disclosures are being removed pursuant to The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which repealed Rule 436(g) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and thereby eliminated the exemption from the expert consent and liability provisions under the Securities Act for any credit ratings issued by a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization." The Original Form 8-K, which is repeated in this Form 8-K/A in its entirety, is not modified in any other respects.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On January 1, 2012, Torchmark Corporation (the "Company") adopted Accounting Standards Update 2010-26, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts" ("ASU 2010-26"), on a retrospective basis. This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to reflect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2010-26 on the Company's previously issued financial statements. For further detail, see Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The following items of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 are being revised in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K:
 
 
 
 
 
These revisions are being made in accordance with applicable accounting rules and should not be read as a restatement of the Company's financial statements.
The revised sections of the Annual Report have not been updated for any other activities or events occurring after February 28, 2012, the date this information was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. This Current Report on Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2012 and our Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments thereto for updated information.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
    Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the major insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.
How Torchmark Views Its Operations:
 
    As fully described in in the the product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and benefit administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:
Insurance Product Line Segments.

Torchmark's operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.
 
    Net income declined slightly from $499 million to $497 million in 2011. It rose 30% or $116 million in 2010, largely as a result of after-tax realized investment gains of $24 million in 2010, compared with losses of $85 million after tax in 2009. The 2009 losses included $94 million of write downs of fixed maturities which were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Realized investment gains were $17 million in 2011. On a diluted per share basis, 2011 net income increased 12% to $4.53, after an increase in 2010 of 31% to $4.05. The above-mentioned after-tax realized investment gains added $.15 to 2011 net income per diluted share and $.20 per share in 2010, while the 2009 loss reduced net income $.69 per share of which the impairment writedowns accounted for $.76 of the loss. More information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption in this report where there is a more complete discussion. Also, as explained in in the , we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Also included in 2010 results is a $35 million after tax loss on the disposal of United Investors, representing $.28 per diluted share.
Summary of Operations:
Realized Gains and Losses
Note 14Business Segments
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
As shown in the above chart, after tax segment operations, before discontinued operations, rose each year over the prior year from $447 million in 2009 to $480 million in 2010 to $494 million in 2011. The primary contributor to the growth in both 2011 and 2010 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment, which margins rose $31 million in 2011 and $34 million in 2010. The life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented. Growth in 2010 was also affected positively by the $20 million increased contribution of excess investment income, the measure of profitability of the investment segment. Excess investment income in 2010 increased over 2009 investment segment income largely because of the unusually large holdings in low-yielding cash and short-term investments held in 2009 due to the uncertain economic climate at that time. These short-term holdings were invested in 2010 as financial conditions improved. Excess investment income was also negatively affected in 2009 because of our issuance of a $300 million 9

debt security in June, 2009 (net proceeds of $296 million) and repayment of a $99 million 8

% security which matured in August, 2009. These transactions resulted in a net increase in our financing costs in 2009 and reduced excess investment income. Growth in 2011 earnings was negatively affected by a decline in the health insurance segment underwriting margin of $10 million, and a $6 million decline in excess investment income from the investment segment. The 2011 decline in health contribution was largely a result of the discontinuance of sales of certain limited-benefit health insurance products because of healthcare reform. The decline in excess investment income was due to the continuing low-interest rate environment which has pressured investment yields and spreads over policy benefit requirements, discussed more fully under the captain in this report.
Investments
 
Total revenues were flat in 2011 at $3.38 billion compared with $3.37 billion in 2010. Revenues increased 8% in 2010 over revenues of $3.12 billion in 2009. Life premium rose 4% or $63 million in 2011 and $72 million in 2010. Net investment income rose 2% or $17 million in 2011, compared with $44 million in 2010. However, growth in revenues in 2011 and 2010 were negatively affected by the declines in health premium described further under this caption.
 
While life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending December 31, 2011, margins as a percentage of premium rose in 2011 to 27% from 26% in 2010 and 25% in 2009. Segment profits for life insurance were not only positively affected by the premium growth, but also by improvements in mortality and persistency in both periods. Life net sales declined 1% in 2011 to $325 million but rose 1% in 2010 to $330 million. Life insurance segment results are discussed further in this report under the caption

Insurance.
 
We primarily market two health insurance products: Medicare Supplement insurance and the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. We also market limited-benefit cancer and accident health products and prior to September, 2010, an under-age-65 limited-benefit hospital-surgical product. Health premium declined 6% in 2011 to $929 million from $987 million in 2010. Health premium declined 3% in 2010. The decreases in both years were caused primarily by the de-emphasis and discontinuance of sales in 2010 of our limited-benefit hospital-surgical health product. Declines in agent counts in the distribution units that market our health products were another negative factor. These factors have caused reductions in net sales of health products which have in turn pressured premium growth. Medicare Supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium, but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product in recent years, resulting in premium declines in each successive year. Our Medicare Part D premium declined 6% in 2011, after having increased 14% in 2010. However, enrollees into our Medicare Part D program for the plan year 2012 were 225 thousand, an increase of 56% over the 2011 enrollees. Therefore, we expect premium growth in 2012 at approximately the same rate. See the discussion under for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.
Health Insurance
 
We offer fixed annuities, but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products, favoring life insurance instead. With the sale of United Investors in 2010, we disposed of 37% of our annuity deposit balance. See the caption for further discussion of the Annuity segment.
Annuities
 
As previously mentioned, the investment segment's pretax profitability, or excess investment income, increased $20 million in 2010 but declined $6 million in 2011. Profitability in this segment is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. In recent years, growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio. One reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Also, there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, in which the funds are held in cash. Growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by Torchmark's share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. In 2011, net investment income rose 3% while the portfolio (at amortized cost) grew 4%, in accordance with the general pattern in recent periods. However, in 2010, the growth in net investment income slightly exceeded the growth in the average portfolio for the first time in many years, primarily as a result of the special constraints on the growth in 2009 net investment income. During 2009, due primarily to uncertainty
 
about liquidity in the financial markets, we held significantly more cash and short term investments than we normally would. Additionally, in 2009, we sold a significant portion of higher-yielding but lower-rated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in lower-yielding but higher-rated bonds in 2009 and early 2010 to improve our risk-adjusted return. These factors contributed to reduced 2009 net investment income.
 
The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets. The lower new-money yields resulting from the low-interest-rate environment noted above have had the effect of compressing excess investment income as required interest has grown. We have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect, including lowering the discount rate going forward and increasing premium rates on sales of new products. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. Financing costs in 2011 were $78 million, an increase of 3% over $75 million in 2010. This increase was primarily a result of increased charges related to our letters of credit facility. In 2010, financing costs increased 8% as interest expense on our long-term debt rose $9 million or 13%. As noted earlier, in 2009 we issued our $300 million 9

Torchmark's current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment-grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 96% of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 95% were investment grade at December 31, 2011. The average quality rating of the portfolio was A-. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no direct investment in European Sovereign debt, no counterparty risks, no credit default swaps, or derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption in this report and in the for a more detailed discussion of this segment.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Capital Resources
 
In each of the years 2011 and 2009, income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. As reported in in the under the caption , we have been involved in certain issues in 2011 or 2009 in which we either received settlements or incurred settlement losses and expenses. In 2011, we settled a state administrative matter in the pretax amount of $6.9 million ($4.5 million after tax) and accrued an estimated liability for a litigation settlement expected to settle in early 2012 in the pretax amount of $12.0 million ($7.8 million after tax). Both of these issues involved matters arising many years ago. Additionally, as described under the same caption of Note 1, we received a tax settlement in the amount of $2.9 million in 2009. The tax settlement primarily involved the results of prior year examinations. The state administrative settlement and the litigation accrual are included in "Other operating expense" and the tax settlement is an adjustment to "Income taxes" in the . However, as described in , we remove items such as these that are concerned with prior periods when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods.

Note 1
 
Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Company's excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these
 
purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. Due to poor economic conditions, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009. However, in the first quarter of 2010, the Board of Directors reactivated the Company's share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, retroactively restated for the three-for-two stock split described in in the .

Option proceeds increased significantly in 2011 due to optionholders exercising several years of option grants that are due to expire in 2012.
 
Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.
 
A discussion of each of Torchmark's segments follows. The following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in .
Note 14Business Segments
 
    Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2011 life premium representing 65% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 71% of the total in 2011. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.
Life Insurance.
 
We completed the process of combining selected United American (UA) Exclusive Agency Branch Offices with the Liberty National Exclusive Agency during 2011. For this reason, all data will be reported on a combined basis in this report.
 
Life insurance premium rose 4% to $1.73 billion in 2011 after having increased 5% in 2010 to $1.66 billion. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:
 
 
 
We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: "annualized premium in force," "net sales," and "first-year collected premium." Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.
 
Annualized life premium in force was $1.81 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of 3% over $1.75 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.69 billion at December 31, 2009.
 
The following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method.
 
 
 
The table below discloses first-year collected life premium by distribution channel.
 
 
 
The focuses primarily on members of labor unions, but also on credit unions and other associations as well as referrals from new customers for its life insurance sales. It is Torchmark's highest profit margin business. The American Income Agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any Torchmark distribution method in 2011. Life premium for this agency rose 8% to $608 million in 2011, after having increased 10% in 2010. Net sales increased 3% in 2011 to $142 million, after having risen 8% in 2010. Net sales rose 18% in 2009. First-year collected premium rose 2% in 2011 to $113 million, after having increased 16% in 2010. The average face amount of policies issued in 2011 was approximately $34 thousand. As in the case of all of Torchmark's agency distribution systems, continued increases in product sales are largely
American Income Exclusive Agency
 
dependent on increases in agent count. The American Income agent count was 4,381 at December 31, 2011 compared with 3,912 a year earlier, an increase of 12%. However, the agent count had declined 6% in 2010 from 4,154 a year earlier. This agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business. Additionally, the systematic, centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruitment of new agents.
 
consists of two primary components: insert media and direct mail. Insert media targets primarily the adult market. It involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media, such as coupon packets, newspapers, bank statements, and billings. Direct mail focuses primarily on young middle-income households with children. The juvenile life insurance policy is a key product for this group. Not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales, but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders. Parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time. At this time, we believe that the Direct Response unit is the largest U.S. writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance. We expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of Direct Response's premier markets.
Direct Response
 
The Direct Response operation accounted for 34% of our life insurance premium during 2011, increasing 5% over 2010 premium. Life premium for this channel rose 6% in 2010 and 5% in 2009. Net sales were flat in 2011 after a 4% increase in 2010 to $137 million. First-year collected premium declined 1% to $89 million in 2011 after a 6% gain in 2010. The average face amount of policies issued in 2011 was approximately $20 thousand.
 
The markets primarily life insurance and supplemental health insurance, focusing primarily on middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was $288 million in 2011, a 2% decrease compared with $295 million in 2010. Life premium for this agency declined 1% in 2010 from 2009. First-year collected premium declined 10% to $31 million in 2011, after having also declined 1% in 2010. The average face amount of policies issued in 2011 was approximately $25 thousand.
Liberty National Exclusive Agency
 
The Liberty Agency's net sales declined 19% to $36 million in 2011, after also having declined 19% a year earlier. As noted above, in the case of all of our agencies, the size of the agency drives product sales. This agency had 1,345 producing agents at December 31, 2011, compared with 2,001 a year earlier, a decline of 33%. The agent count at Liberty had also declined 19% in 2010 from 2,471. The decrease in agent count has been due in part to the closing of several offices which had low production. In addition, agent compensation issues that arose in 2009 have negatively impacted agent counts. The bonus thresholds proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated. Management reduced the bonus threshold later in 2009. Also, due to deteriorating first-year persistency, management modified compensation incentives in 2009 to place more emphasis on the persistency of newly issued policies. These changes resulted in the departure of a number of the less productive agents in 2010 and 2011. While these modifications caused a loss of agents, they resulted in improved persistency and margins, and contributed to Torchmark's overall improvement in life insurance margins.
 
The Liberty Exclusive Agency agent counts have also decreased due to issues related to its health insurance business. This agency's health insurance marketing efforts had historically been focused on limited-benefit hospital-surgical plans. These plans were subject to intense competition from other companies which offered lower-margin products providing agents with products that were easier to sell, thus discouraging sales of our products and ultimately resulting in decreases in agent counts. In addition, these limited-benefit hospital-surgical plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments. Sales of these limited-benefit hospital/surgical plans were discontinued after September, 2010. These developments caused further increases in agent turnover. In response, the agency has shifted its marketing focus to a product mix more weighted towards life insurance and supplemental health insurance products (not affected by healthcare reform) that have higher margins and persistency. Additionally, we are in the process of changing the cost structure of this agency to a more commission-driven model. Going forward, branch office operating expenses will be the responsibility of the branch managers and all new agent recruits will be independent contractors rather than employees. We are also implementing new agent recruiting and training programs similar to those used at American Income. We believe these changes will increase the Agency's profitability and stability in the long run.
 
We also offer life insurance through consisting of the Military Agency, the United American Independent Agency, and other small miscellaneous sales agencies. The Military Agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life products with term insurance riders. Military premium represented 11% of life premium at December 31, 2011. The United American Independent Agency represented approximately 1% of Torchmark's total life premium at that date. This agency is focused on health insurance, with life sales being incidental.
Other Agencies
 
 
 
Gross margins, as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 7% in 2011 and 9% in 2010. The margin increased to $461 million in 2011 after rising to $430 million in 2010. As a percentage of life insurance premium, the 2011 margin rose to 27% after rising to 26% a year earlier. Margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth. Improved mortality was also a factor in 2011.
 
 
    Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement and Part D prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal Medicare program, cancer coverage, and accident coverage. All health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement and Part D are classified here as limited-benefit plans. For several years, our primary health insurance product had been limited-benefit hospital/surgical plans. However, as previously discussed under the caption , these plans became subject to intense competition which resulted in decreasing agent counts, most notably in the Liberty National Exclusive Agency but also in the UA Independent Agency. In addition, these plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments. These factors contributed to the Company's decisions to discontinue the marketing of these limited-benefit hospital/surgical products after September, 2010. We do continue to market the limited-benefit cancer and accident products. Since 2009, Medicare Supplement sales have exceeded those of the limited-benefit products, and represented 59% of health net sales exclusive of Medicare Part D in 2011. Medicare Supplement sales have been stronger than limited-benefit sales due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below.

Life Insurance
 
Total health premium represented 35% of Torchmark's total premium income in 2011. Excluding Part D premium, health premium represented 28% of total premium income in 2011, compared with 29% in 2010 and 32% in 2009. Health underwriting margin, excluding Part D, accounted for 25% of the total in 2011, compared with 28% in 2010 and 30% in 2009. These declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment. Health results have also been affected by the discontinuance of sales of the previously-mentioned health products. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.
 
 
 
 
We market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the United American Independent Agency being our market leader. The following table presents net sales by distribution method for the last three years.
 
 
 
 
The following table discloses first-year collected health premium by distribution method.
 
 
 
 
The Medicare Part D Health product will be presented and discussed separately in this report.
 
Health premium other than Part D has declined in each successive year presented, falling 6% in 2011 to $734 million and 7% in 2010. Net sales decreased 1% in 2011 to $64 million after a decline of 33% in 2010. First-year collected premium has also declined in each period considered. These declines in sales and premium resulted from several factors: (1) our previously-mentioned emphasis on life sales, due to life's superior margins and its greater contribution to investment income; (2) the discontinuance of sales of various limited-benefit health products; and (3) the decline in agent counts in certain distribution units that market health products.
Health insurance, excluding Medicare Part D.
 
 
Medicare Supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium, partially because Medicare Supplement products are generally more persistent than the limited-benefit products, but also because of more stable sales in recent periods. Medicare Supplement premium also continues to grow in relation to our limited-benefit health premium. Medicare Supplement premium represented 60% of non-Part D health premium in 2011, compared with 58% in 2010 and 55% in 2009.
 
The represented 39% of all Torchmark non-Part D health premium income at $290 million in 2011. The Liberty Agency markets Medicare Supplements and limited-benefit health products consisting primarily of cancer insurance. In 2011, health premium income in this Agency declined 12% from prior year premium of $331 million. Premium also fell 15% in 2010 from $389 million. First-year collected premium declined 20% to $13 million in 2011, after declining 52% a year earlier. As noted earlier, the discontinuance of sales of certain health products and the earlier increased competition in the health insurance market had caused steep declines in the agent count in this Agency. As of December 31, 2011, this Agency had 1,345 agents, a decline of 33% from the 2010 year end count of 2,001. In 2010, the number of agents fell 19% from 2,471 at year end 2009. The decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales, translating into declines in premium. Net sales for 2011 rose 19% from $14 million in 2010 to $17 million due to the introduction of new products. In 2010, this Agency's net sales fell 52%. Also discussed under the caption are efforts designed to strengthen this Agency.
Liberty National Exclusive Agency
Life Insurance
 
is Torchmark's largest in terms of health premium income. This Agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark whose size range from very large, multi-state organizations down to one-person offices. All of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies. Torchmark had 1,447 active producing agents at December 31, 2011 compared with 1,406 a year earlier. This agency is our largest distributor of non-Part D health insurance in terms of health net sales, representing 51% in 2011. This Agency is also our largest producer of Medicare Supplement insurance, with $270 million or 61% of our Medicare Supplement premium income in 2011. Net sales for this Agency increased 2% to $33 million in 2011, after having declined 25% in 2010 from $43 million in 2009. The greater amount of net sales in 2009 were due to increases in group Medicare Supplement sales. Group Medicare Supplement sales fluctuate greatly from period to period and do not indicate a trend. Total health premium income for the UA Independent Agency was $306 million in 2011, a 3% decline from 2010 premium of $315 million. Premium income also declined 4% in 2010. These declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses.
The UA Independent Agency
 
predominantly a life insurance distribution channel, is our third largest health insurance distributor based on premium income. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans. Approximately 69% of the agency's 2011 health premium was from accident policies. Sales of the plans by this Agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.
The American Income Exclusive Agency,
 
Health premium at this agency rose 1% in 2011 to $80 million, after having increased 5% to $79 million in 2010. However, net health sales declined 27% to $10 million in 2011. Net sales were $13 million in both 2010 and 2009. Net health sales comprised only 6% of the American Income Agency's total net sales in 2011.
 
, primarily a life operation, also offers health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups. In both 2011 and 2010, net health sales were $5 million. In 2011, net health sales for this group represented approximately 4% of Direct Response's total life and health net sales. Direct Response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year. Health premium rose 5% in 2011 to $57 million and 17% in 2010.
Direct Response
 
      Torchmark, through its subsidiary United American, offers coverage under the government's Medicare Part D plan. The Medicare Part D plan is a stand-alone prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Part D is regulated and partially funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for participating private insurers like United American. Under Part D, private carriers are the primary insurers, while CMS provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance. Total Medicare Part D premium was $197 million in 2011, compared with $209 million in 2010, a decline of 6%. Part D premium rose 14% in 2010. Changes in Part D premium generally result from changes in the number of
Medicare Part D.
 
enrollees. At December 31, 2011, United American had approximately 225 thousand enrollees for the 2012 Part D plan, compared with 144 thousand for the 2011 plan year and 158 thousand for the 2010 plan year. Growth for the plan year 2012 was largely a result of a new lower cost Part D plan which allowed us to pick up a large number of low-income automatic enrollees and to grow our own individual sales. The new product is priced to achieve the same underwriting margin as our existing product. Our Medicare Part D product is sold through the Direct Response operation and to groups through the UA Independent Agency. Part D net sales were $115 million in 2011, compared with $39 million in 2010 and $43 million in 2009. We count only sales to new first-time enrollees in net sales, and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees.
 
We believe that the Medicare Part D program is a meaningful component of our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior-age market and with Medicare Supplements, the government assurances with regard to the risk-sharing agreements for participating insurers, limited-risk due to the incremental income added to our health insurance margins, and the renewal of the business every year. Due to our experience with service to the senior-age market and the use of our existing Direct Response marketing system, entry to this business required little new investment. However, as with any government-sponsored program, the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market.
 
As presented in the following table, Torchmark's health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense declined 5% in 2011 to $189 million but remained essentially flat at $199 million in 2010. As a percentage of premium income, margins were 20% in both 2011 and 2010 as compared with 19% in 2009.
 
 
 
 
    As described in , we sold our subsidiary United Investors. United Investors was our carrier of variable annuities and a primary carrier of fixed annuities. As a result of the sale, we disposed of approximately 37% of our annuity deposit balance as of December 31, 2010, including all of our variable annuities. Accordingly, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.
Annuities.
Note 3Discontinued Operations
 
Our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2011, 2010, and 2009, were $1.29 billion, $1.24 billion, and $959 million, respectively. Underwriting income was $2.3 million, $1.3 million, and $3.2 thousand in each of the years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
 
While the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year, policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly. The stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist primarily of surrender charges and are not based on account size. These charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. In each of the years presented, the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities. Furthermore, spreads were increased by the introduction of a new annuity form on Liberty National paper in mid-2009. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits.
 
Operating expenses are included in the Other and Corporate Segments and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2011.
Administrative expenses.    
 
 
 
Insurance administrative expenses have trended upwards and rose 2% in 2011, after having increased 4% in 2010. As a percentage of premium, they increased .1% in each successive year to 6.0% in 2011. Employee costs increased 25% in 2010, primarily as a result of unusually high employee health insurance costs in that year. Partially offsetting the increase in 2010 employee costs was a decline in legal costs, as we favorably settled certain previously reserved litigation during 2010. In 2011, however, legal expenses returned to normal levels. Expenses for 2011 correlated more closely by expense component to 2009 expenses, as 2010 expenses reflected the aforementioned unusual items. Parent Company expense declined in 2011 primarily as a result of the decline in certain employee benefit liabilities related to retired employees. Stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of Torchmark stock has increased, resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options. As stated in in the , management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense, and therefore treats it as a Parent Company expense.
Note 14Business Segments
Notes to Consolidated financial Statements
 
As mentioned in Note 1 in the , we incurred two settlement expense issues in 2011 that related to events occurring many years ago: the settlement of a state administrative issue of $7 million and a litigation issue in the estimated amount of $12 million. In addition to these two items, we recorded two nonrecurring charges. In 2011, we sold aviation equipment at a loss of $979 thousand and in 2009, we wrote down Company-occupied real estate that was other-than-temporarily impaired in the amount of $355 thousand. While these nonrecurring expenses were included in "Operating expenses" for the respective year in the in accordance with accounting guidance, they are considered as non-operating expenses by management.

Consolidated Statements of Operations
 
We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in in the It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or "financing costs." We also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used over $5 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.
Investments.    
Note 14
Business Segments
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
.    The following table summarizes Torchmark's investment income and excess investment income.
Excess Investment Income
 
 
 
 
Excess investment income declined $6 million or 2% in 2011 from the prior year. Excess investment income rose $20 million or 8% in 2010. On a per diluted share basis, excess investment income rose 10% to $2.36 per share in 2011, after having risen 9% in the prior year. The favorable increases in the per share amounts relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share purchases.
 
The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 3% to $707 million in 2011. It increased 8% to $685 million in 2010 from $632 million in 2009. Presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets.
 
 
Growth in net investment income generally correlates somewhat with the growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost. With the exception of the years 2009 and 2010, growth in investment income has slightly lagged the growth in mean assets for several years. One of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than the growth in mean invested assets in recent years is due to the low-interest-rate environment during that period. As a result, new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested. During these lags, we have held cash at lower yields. During 2009, because of the uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets, we held significantly more cash and short-term investments than in other years. Holding this larger balance of low-yielding securities in 2009 resulted in the extremely low growth rate in income in that year, and also affected the higher growth rate in 2010 as these lower yielding cash balances were invested in 2010. The trend of lags in growth in net investment income in relation to the growth in mean invested assets is expected to continue until yields on suitable new investments exceed the portfolio yield.
 
Excess investment income is reduced by required interest on net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt. Information about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table.
 
 
 
The combined average interest discount rate has risen in each of the last three years due to changes in the mix of the in force business. For more specific information on life and health discount rates, please refer to in the .
Note 6Future Policy Benefit Reserves
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below reconciles interest expense per the to financing costs.
Consolidated Statements of Operations
 
The table below presents the components of financing costs.
 
 
 
 
Financing costs increased $2 million or 3% in 2011. They rose $6 million or 8% in 2010. The increase in financing costs in 2010 reflects the issuance in June 2009 of $300 million principal amount 9% Senior Notes due in 2019. In 2010, we incurred a full year of interest on this issue. The 2011 increase in interest on short-term debt was primarily a result of the $2.1 million increase in financing charges on our letter of credit facility, arising from the December, 2010 restructuring of our credit facility. More information on this facility is disclosed under the caption in the section of this report and in in the . The 2010 decrease was due to a decline in short-term rates over the previous year, but was also impacted by a 22% decline in the average balance of commercial paper outstanding compared with 2009.
Short-Term Borrowings
Financial
Condition
Note 11Debt
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates.
 
However, growth in our excess investment income decreases when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs, such as we have experienced in recent periods. In an extended low-interest-rate environment, the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long-term rates. We believe, however, the decline would be relatively slow, as only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years. We also believe that the deferred acquisition costs and benefit reserve balances on our life and health business would not be impacted by an extended low-interest-rate environment. While these balances for annuities could be affected, the impact would be immaterial.
 
In response to the lower interest rates, we raised the new business premium rates on certain life products. The increased premiums will provide additional margin on these policies to help offset the possible future reductions in excess investment income and are not expected to have a detrimental impact on sales.
 
.    Torchmark's current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment-grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities (maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date) that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. Further, we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If such longer-term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives, we consider investing in short-term securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time. During calendar years 2009 through 2011, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, primarily with longer-term maturities as presented in the chart below.
Investment Acquisitions
 
The following table summarizes selected information for fixed-maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield. This date is commonly known as the "worst call date." Two different average life calculations are shown, average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date.
 
 
 
We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment. However, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart. The average life of funds invested in 2009 (to both next call and maturity) was lower than that of funds invested during 2011 and 2010 due to actions taken for statutory capital management purposes and the limited availability of longer term investments.
 
During the three years 2009 through 2011, we have invested primarily in investment-grade corporate bonds. Purchases in 2011 were almost entirely in these corporates. During 2009 and 2010, we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds, primarily Build America Bonds authorized by the American Recovery and Retirement Act of 2009. The investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services. In assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds, we took into account a number of factors, including the geographic location of the municipalities.
 
New cash flow available for investment is primarily provided through our insurance operations, but has also been affected by other factors. Issuer calls, as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years are a factor. Issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost. Calls increase funds available for investment,
 
but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $187 million in 2011, $109 million in 2010, and $181 million in 2009. The higher level of acquisitions in 2009 was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below.
 
    During 2009, the Company sold $703 million of fixed maturities at amortized cost, including $293 million of below- investment-grade securities. The market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where, even though the sales price was less than amortized cost, management determined that better risk-adjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities. Other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes. Due in large part to selling below-investment-grade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investment-grade securities, below-investment-grade securities declined significantly as a percentage of total fixed maturities at year end 2009. The reduction in below-investment-grade securities had a positive impact on the risk-based capital position of our insurance subsidiaries at that date and thereafter.
Sales transactions.
 
    Because Torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmark's components of invested assets at amortized cost as of December 31, 2011 with the latest industry data.
Portfolio Analysis.
 
 
At December 31, 2011, approximately 95% of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixed-maturity portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, made up an additional 4%. The remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities, mortgage loans, and other long-term and short-term investments.
 
Because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities. An analysis of our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 is as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
At December 31, 2011, fixed maturities had a fair value of $11.9 billion, compared with $10.5 billion at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, fixed maturities were in a $964 million net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized gain position of $108 million at December 31, 2010. Approximately 77% of our fixed maturity assets at December 31, 2011 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 11% were redeemable preferred stocks. This compares with 74% corporate bonds and 13% redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2010. On a combined basis, residential mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were less than 2% of the assets at amortized cost at December 31, 2011. The $60 million of CDOs at amortized cost made up less than 0.6% of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. The $14 million of residential mortgage-backed securities are rated AAA. For more information about our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2011 and 2010, including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see in the .
Note 4Investments
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products, Torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery. Even though these fixed maturity investments are available for sale, Torchmark generally expects and intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired.
 
Additional information concerning the fixed-maturity portfolio is as follows.
 
 
 
Credit risk is the level of certainty that a security's issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. Approximately 88% of our fixed-maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities (including redeemable preferred and asset-backed securities). As we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, credit risk is a concern. We mitigate this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring only investment-grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer. We continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. We also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors.
Credit Risk Sensitivity.    
 
The following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at December 31, 2011.
 
 
At December 31, 2011, approximately 32% of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost (31% at fair value) were in the financial sector, including 16% in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 12% in banks at amortized cost. Financial guarantors, mortgage insurers, and insurance brokers comprised approximately 4% of the portfolio. After financials, the next largest sector was utilities, which comprised 16% of the portfolio at amortized cost. The balance of the portfolio is spread among 262 issuers in a wide variety of sectors. As previously noted, gross unrealized losses were $239 million at December 31, 2011, declining from $368 million a year earlier. The portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $964 million at December 31, 2011.
 
As shown in the table above, the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was approximately 50% for our investments in CDOs. As previously noted, CDOs represented less than 0.6% of our fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2011. We evaluated each of the impaired securities in this and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of the impairments were other-than-temporary. Our portfolio consisted of five CDO investments at December 31, 2011, in which three were carried at a value of $0, one was considered only temporarily impaired, and one was previously considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
 
The CDO considered temporarily impaired was carried at an amortized cost of $23.4 million and had a fair value of $7.7 million. The CDO considered other-than-temporarily impaired was previously written down and carried at an amortized cost of $37.0 million, based on the present value of expected cash flows at the original purchase yield. This CDO had a fair value of $22.7 million at December 31, 2011. The collateral underlying these CDOs is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies, and no sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages are included in the collateral.
 
In reaching these conclusions concerning the other-than-temporary impairment of our CDOs, we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers of each of these CDOs the current status of the collateral underlying our investments, the credit events (defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral) experienced to date, and the possibility of future credit events. We calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience. We reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events could have on our expected future cash flows. We calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate. While there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations, we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions.
 
An analysis of the fixed-maturity portfolio by a composite rating at December 31, 2011 is shown in the table below. The composite rating for each security is the average of the security's ratings as assigned by Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average.
 
 
 
The portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of A- based on amortized cost. Approximately 93% of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending. There are no off-balance sheet investments, as all investments are reported on our . We have no direct exposure to European sovereign debt.
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 
Our current investment policy is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.
 
An analysis of changes in below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows.
 
 
    Torchmark's financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company's investment portfolio. Since 96% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed-maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, in accordance with GAAP, these liabilities are not marked to market.
Market Risk Sensitivity.
 
The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.
 
 
Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.
Realized Gains and Losses.    
 
Investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.
 
Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period-to-period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.
 
The following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011.
 
 
 
 
As described in under the caption in the we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2009 through 2011 as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as discussed in and in our in this report. The writedowns resulted in pretax charges of $20 thousand in 2011 ($13 thousand after tax), $5 million in 2010 ($3 million after tax), and $143 million in 2009 ($94 million after tax). The 2009 charge included $83 million on CDOs ($55 million after tax) and $24 million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers ($16 million after tax). The remaining writedowns in 2009 were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds. In 2010, we acquired $7.3 million book value of our 9

    Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.
Liquidity.
 
    The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries' operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries' prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. The leading source of the excess cash is investment income. However, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash comes from underwriting income.
Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity.
 
    Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, operating expenses of the Parent, and Parent Company dividends to Torchmark shareholders. In 2011, the Parent received $790 million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries, as compared with $401 million in 2010 and $392 million in 2009. The 2011 dividend included $305 million of additional dividends available as a result of the sale of United Investors. After paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in 2011 of approximately $672 million, including the $305 million from the sale of United Investors. Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In 2012, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive approximately $470 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries, and that approximately $360 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of in the Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company. As additional liquidity, the Parent held $27 million of cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2011, compared with $63 million a year earlier. The Parent also had available a $51 million receivable from subsidiaries at December 31, 2011.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had available $177 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility, as compared with $203 million a year earlier. For detailed information about this line of credit facility, see the section of .
Short-Term Borrowings.

The following table presents certain information about our short-term borrowings, all of which was commercial paper.
 
 
 
There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the three years ended December 31, 2011.
 
In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2012 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, a short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.
 
Consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were $859 million in 2011, compared with $1.03 billion in 2010, and $976 million in 2009. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies have received $230 million in investment calls and tenders and $180 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2011. Maturities, tenders, and calls totaled $639 million in 2010 and $761 million in 2009.
Consolidated Liquidity
.
 
Our cash and short-term investments were $105 million at year-end 2011 and $582 million at year-end 2010. Included in cash at December 31, 2010 was the $343 million of proceeds received from the sale of United Investors on that date. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $11.9 billion at December 31, 2011. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.
 
    As described in in the and under the subcaption Torchmark had outstanding $120 million (par amount) 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. The capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders. As described in in the we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the Trust Preferred shareholders. The trust is an off-balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with GAAP rules, because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest. While these liabilities are not on our , they are represented by Torchmark's 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust in the amount of $124 million which is on our balance sheets at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. The 7.1% preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 7.1% interest payment on our debt to the trusts.

As a part of its above-mentioned credit facility, Torchmark had outstanding $198 million in stand-by letters of credit at December 31, 2011. However, these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole.
 
As of December 31, 2011, we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third-party entities other than as described above.

The carrying value of the funded debt was $914 million at December 31, 2011, compared with $913 million a year earlier. As fully explained in , we issued $300 million principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due in 2019 in June of 2009 for proceeds of $296 million. A portion of these proceeds were used to repay the $99 million due upon the August, 2009 maturity of our 8% Senior Debentures. In addition, we also used $175 million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in 2009 in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes. The regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by rating-agency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios. The subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investment-grade fixed maturities.
Note 11Debt
 
Our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325% of required regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark. At December 31, 2011, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had RBC ratios of approximately 336%. Should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below 325%, management has more than sufficient liquidity at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325%.
 
As noted under the caption in this report, we reactivated our share repurchase program during the first quarter of 2010. We previously had suspended the program indefinitely in March, 2009 due to general economic conditions at that time. However, since reactivation, we have made share purchases each quarter of 2010 and 2011. Under this program, we acquired 19 million shares at a cost of $788 million in 2011 (average of $41.68 per share), 6 million shares for $204 million in 2010, and 3 million shares for $47 million in 2009. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year. Please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption in this report.
Summary of Operations
Summary of Operations
 
Torchmark has recently increased the dividend on its common shares. In the first quarter of 2010, the dividend was increased from $.0933 per share to $.10 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2010, it was further increased to $.1067 per share. In the second quarter of 2011, it was again raised to $.12 per share.
 
Shareholders' equity was $3.9 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $3.7 billion at December 31, 2010. During the twelve months since December 31, 2010, shareholders' equity was reduced by the $788 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another $185 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises, but has been increased by the $497 million of net income and by after tax unrealized gains of $538 million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved.
 
We plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so. Excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies.
 
We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders' liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders' equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders' equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders' equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders' equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders' equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. From time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders' equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.
 
The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmark's capital structure.
 
 
 
 
Previously, the FASB issued guidance which offered an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our . However, unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. Therefore, we have not elected this option.
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 
Torchmark's ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 10.7 times in 2011, compared with 11.3 times in 2010 and 9.3 times in 2009. This times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption in this report.

Financial Strength Ratings
 
The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by Standard & Poor's and A. M. Best. The following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2011.
 
 
A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+ (Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time.
 
The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poor's Corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. The minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.
 
 
 
    Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims that are tried in Alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in Alabama are based upon the compensatory damages (including mental anguish) awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined. Additionally, it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the State of Mississippi, a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to in the

The FASB has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to Torchmark, effective in future periods:
 
Under this guidance, the components of comprehensive income must be presented as either 1) a continuous statement (including the components of net income) or 2) as two separate but consecutive statements (an income statement followed by a comprehensive income statement). This guidance is effective for us in interim and annual periods beginning in 2012. Because we already present comprehensive income as contemplated by the second alternative, this guidance should not result in any change.
Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05).
 
The primary purpose of this new guidance is to converge the measurement criteria and disclosures of fair value in U.S. GAAP with those of International Accounting Standards. The measurement principles are generally consistent with current U.S. GAAP and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. The guidance will require additional disclosures, including expanded disclosures for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and a requirement to disclose the level in the fair value hierarchy of items whose fair value is disclosed but not measured at fair value on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for us in calendar 2012, with early adoption prohibited.
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure (ASU 2011-04).
 
The issuance of this update permits an optional qualitative assessment in order to simplify how an entity tests its goodwill for impairment. Under this assessment, if an entity concludes that a reporting units' fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, it would not be required to perform any further impairment testing for that reporting unit. Otherwise, the two-step impairment test under current guidance would be required for the reporting unit. This new guidance lists factors to consider in making the qualitative assessment. The revised guidance is applicable to us beginning in 2012, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this new guidance to impact the value of our goodwill, only to modify the way we test for its impairment.
Goodwill Impairment Testing (ASU 2011-08).
 
. Private health insurance carriers will be required to pay a new fee to the Federal government beginning in calendar year 2014 under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This guidance addresses questions about how to recognize and classify the fees, basically requiring that it be expensed ratably throughout the year. It is effective for Torchmark beginning in the year 2014. Because the majority of Torchmark's health products are excluded from the mandate, the impact of adoption should be immaterial.
Health Insurer's Fees Paid to the Federal Government (ASU 2011-06)
 
 
    Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in in the A list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in

Future Policy Benefit Reserves
.
 
Approximately 81% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2011 were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are "locked in" and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in in the under the caption Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. Torchmark had no premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended December 31, 2011.

Future Policy Benefits.
 
The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.
 
    Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs eligible for deferral consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract, as indicated in  under the caption in the Additionally, our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in
Deferred Acquisition Costs.
Note

Significant Accounting Policies
Deferred Acquisition Costs
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 1
.
 
Approximately 98% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2011 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are "locked-in" at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2011.
 
The remaining 2% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. As noted earlier in this report, our variable annuity block was disposed of as of December 31, 2010. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2011.
 
    This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability
Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable.
 
for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.
 
    We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to manage risk. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed-maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption in this report. However, as discussed under the caption in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.
Valuation of Fixed Maturities.
Market Risk
Sensitivity
Financial Condition
 
At times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. Illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is presented in under the caption .

Fair Value Measurements
 
We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value, where fair value has declined below carrying value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in and in the and the discussions under the captions and in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.

We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2011, our gross liability under these funded plans was $282 million, but was offset by assets of $258 million.
Defined benefit pension plans.    
 
The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. Our discount rate, rate of return on assets, and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in in the The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary,

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries (Torchmark) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of Torchmark's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Torchmark Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
 
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted for the Company's adoption of guidance relating to a change in accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts.
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Torchmark's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on Torchmark's internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1Significant Accounting Policies
 
Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark or alternatively, the Company) through its subsidiaries provides a variety of life and health insurance products and annuities to a broad base of customers.
Business:    
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), under guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Basis of Presentation:    
 
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Torchmark and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Principles of Consolidation:    
 
Torchmark accounts for its variable interest entities under accounting guidance which clarifies the definition of a variable interest and the instructions for consolidating variable interest entities (VIE's). Only primary beneficiaries are required or allowed to consolidate VIE's. Therefore, a company may have voting control of a VIE, but if it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, it is not permitted to consolidate the VIE. The trust that is liable for Torchmark's Trust Preferred Securities meets the definition of a VIE. However, Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of this entity because its interest is not variable. Therefore, Torchmark is not permitted to consolidate its interest, even though it owns 100% of the voting equity of the trust and guarantees its performance. For this reason, Torchmark reports its 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust as "Due to affiliates" each period at its carrying value. However, Torchmark views the Trust Preferred Securities as it does any other debt offering and consolidates the trust in its segment analysis because GAAP requires that the segment analysis be reported as management views its operations and financial condition.
 
Additionally, as further described under the caption below in this note, Torchmark holds passive interests in limited partnerships which provide investment returns through the provision of tax benefits (principally from the transfer of Federal or state tax credits related to federal low-income housing). These interests are also considered to be VIEs. They are not consolidated because the Company has no power to control the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of these entities and therefore the Company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these interests. Torchmark's involvement is limited to its limited partnership interest in the entities. Torchmark has not provided any other financial support to the entities beyond its commitments to fund its limited partnership interests, and there are no arrangements or agreements with any of the interests to provide other financial support. The maximum loss exposure relative to these interests is limited to their carrying value.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests
 
When a component of Torchmark's business is sold or expected to be sold during the ensuing year, Torchmark reports the assets and liabilities of the component as assets and liabilities of subsidiaries held for sale. Assets or liabilities of subsidiaries held for sale are segregated and are recorded in the at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized. Torchmark reports the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations when the component is sold or expected to be sold, the operations and cash flows of the business have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction, and Torchmark will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transaction. The results of discontinued operations are reported in discontinued operations in the for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the business is either disposed of or is accounted for as a disposal group, including any gain or loss recognized on the sale or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.

Torchmark classifies all of its fixed-maturity investments, which include bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, as available for sale. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in equity securities, which include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Mortgage loans, included in "Other long-term investments," are carried at amortized cost. Investments in real estate, included in "Other long-term investments," are reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method. Short-term investments include investments in interest-bearing time deposits with original maturities of twelve months or less.
Investments:    
 
Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. Income attributable to investments is included in Torchmark's net investment income. Net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 included $552 million, $522 million, and $487 million, respectively, which was allocable to policyholder reserves or accounts. Realized investment gains and losses are not allocated to insurance policyholders' liabilities.
 
:    Fair values for cash, short-term investments, short-term debt, receivables and payables approximate carrying value. Fair values for long-term debt investments, equity securities, and certain other assets are determined in accordance with specific accounting guidance. Fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. Otherwise, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments in active markets, quotes in inactive markets, or other observable criteria. For specific information regarding Torchmark's measurements and procedures in valuing financial instruments, please see under the caption The fair values of Torchmark's long-term debt issues, along with the trust preferred securities, are based on quoted market prices. Mortgage loans are valued at discounted cash flows.

    Torchmark evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment as described in  under the caption . If a security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and is treated as a realized loss. The written-down security will be amortized and revenue recognized in accordance with estimated future cash flows.
Impairment of Investments:
Note 4
Investments
Other-than-temporary-impairments
 
Current accounting guidance is such that if an entity intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired security prior to recovery of its cost basis, the security is to be considered other-than-temporarily impaired and the full amount of impairment must be charged to earnings. Otherwise, losses on fixed maturities which are other-than-temporarily impaired are separated into two categories, the portion of loss which is considered credit loss and the portion of loss which is due to other factors. The credit loss portion is charged to earnings while the loss due to other factors is charged to other comprehensive income.
 
Cash consists of balances on hand and on deposit in banks and financial institutions. Overdrafts arising from the overnight investment of funds offset cash balances on hand and on deposit.
Cash:    
 
 
Note 1Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Premium income for traditional long-duration life and health insurance products is recognized when due from the policyholder. Premiums for short-duration health contracts are recognized as revenue over the contract period in proportion to the insurance protection provided. Profits for limited-payment life insurance contracts are recognized over the contract period. Premiums for universal life-type and annuity contracts are added to the policy account value, and revenues for such products are recognized as charges to the policy account value for mortality, administration, and surrenders (retrospective deposit method). Life premium includes policy charges of $24 million, $26 million, and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Other premium consists of annuity policy charges in each year. Profits are also earned to the extent that investment income exceeds policy liability interest requirements. The related benefits and expenses are matched with revenues by means of the provision of future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in a manner which recognizes profits as they are earned over the same period.
Recognition of Premium Revenue and Related Expenses:    
 
The liability for future policy benefits for universal life-type products is represented by policy account value. The liability for future policy benefits for all other life and health products, approximately 81% of total future policy benefits, is provided on the net level premium method based on estimated investment yields, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other assumptions which were considered appropriate at the time the policies were issued. Assumptions used are based on Torchmark's previous experience with similar products. Once established, assumptions for these products are generally not changed. An additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions. These estimates are periodically reviewed and compared with actual experience. If it is determined that existing contract liabilities, together with the present value of future gross premiums, will not be sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits and to recover unamortized acquisition costs, then a premium deficiency exists. Such a deficiency would be recognized immediately by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future policy benefits. From that point forward, the liability for future policy benefits would be based on the revised assumptions.
Future Policy Benefits:    
 
Certain costs of acquiring new insurance business are deferred and recorded as an asset. These costs are essential to the acquisition of new insurance business and are directly related to the successful issuance of an insurance contract including sales commissions, policy issue costs, and underwriting costs for policies that are successfully issued. Deferred acquisition costs are amortized in a systematic manner which matches these costs with the associated revenues. The method of amortization has not changed due to the adoption of the new guidance described under the caption following in this Note. Policies other than universal life-type policies are amortized with interest over the estimated premium-paying period of the policies in a manner which charges each year's operations in proportion to the receipt of premium income. Limited-payment contracts are amortized over the contract period. Universal life-type policies are amortized with interest in proportion to estimated gross profits. The assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs with regard to interest, mortality, morbidity, and persistency are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits. For interest-sensitive and deposit-balance type products, these assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations. For all other products, amortization assumptions are generally not revised once established. Deferred acquisition costs are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing to determine if there is a premium deficiency. These tests ensure that the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized deferred acquisition cost asset. These cash flows consist primarily of premium income, less benefits and expenses taking inflation into account. The present value of these cash flows, less the benefit reserve, is then compared with the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance. In the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less, the deficiency would be recognized by a charge to earnings and either a reduction of unamortized acquisition costs or an increase in the liability for future benefits, as described under the caption .

Deferred Acquisition Costs
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
Future Policy Benefits
 
Costs related to advertising are generally charged to expense as incurred. However, certain direct response advertising costs are capitalized when there is a reliable and demonstrated relationship between total costs and future benefits that is a direct result of incurring these costs. Torchmark's Direct Response advertising costs consist primarily of the production and distribution costs of direct mail advertising materials, and when capitalized are included as a component of deferred acquisition costs. They are amortized in the same manner as other deferred acquisition costs. Direct response advertising costs charged to earnings and included in other operating expense were $16 million, $12 million, and $10 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Capitalized advertising costs were $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and $972 million at December 31, 2010.
:
Advertising Costs
 
The adoption of the new accounting guidance described below changed the method by which Torchmark reports direct response advertising costs. Prior to the adoption, the Company capitalized all such advertising costs as permitted under previous guidance.
 
Torchmark has adopted the new accounting guidance under Accounting Standard Update 2010-26 (ASU 2010-26), issued by the FASB concerning policy acquisition costs. While the guidance was not effective until January 1, 2012, the Company elected to retrospectively adopt the new guidance as permitted by ASU 2010-26. Retrospective adoption means that the deferred acquisition cost asset has been adjusted to a level as if the new guidance had been in effect in prior periods presented, with an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance. This new guidance amends the previous accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in order to address the diversity in practice surrounding the capitalization and deferral of these costs. As a result of this new standard, certain costs that were previously capitalized (deferred) and amortized as deferred acquisition costs are no longer allowed to be deferred and are expensed as incurred. The new guidance limits the deferral of costs to those direct incremental costs related to the successful issuance of an insurance contract, and includes primarily sales commissions, policy issue, and underwriting costs for policies that are successfully issued. Previously, the Company was allowed to defer any cost that varied with and related to the production of new business. For Torchmark, the costs that are no longer deferrable primarily relate to agent distribution systems, and include such costs as training, recruiting, office space, and certain management and underwriting expenses.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard:
 
The limitations on acquisition cost deferrals resulting from the retrospective adoption have resulted in an increase in commissions and expenses from those previously reported. However, as a result of the retrospective writedown of the deferred acquisition cost asset, the amortization of previously deferred costs decreased, partially offsetting the impact of the increased expenses. The cumulative effect of the retrospective adoption of the standard resulted in a decrease in shareholders' equity of $309 million as of January 1, 2009. A summary of the impact on previously reported financial statement balances due to the adoption is as follows:
 
 
 
 
The adoption of this guidance causes a delay in the recognition of underwriting profit on newly issued business, but not the ultimate profitability of that business. The adoption had no impact on Torchmark's cash flows, liquidity, or the statutory earnings of its insurance subsidiaries.
 
 
Note 1Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Torchmark establishes a liability for known policy benefits payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience. Torchmark makes an estimate after careful evaluation of all information available to the Company. However, there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, will be Torchmark's ultimate obligation.
Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable:    
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement book values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. More information concerning income taxes is provided in .
Income Taxes:    
Note 8Income Taxes
 
Property and equipment, included in "Other assets," is reported at cost less allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is recorded primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets which range from two to ten years for equipment and five to forty years for buildings and improvements. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Impairments, if any, are recorded when, based on events and circumstances, it becomes evident that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Original cost of property and equipment was $119 million at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. Accumulated depreciation was $71 million at year end 2011 and $65 million at the end of 2010. Depreciation expense was $6.8 million in 2011, $6.0 million in 2010, and $4.6 million in 2009.
Property and Equipment:    
 
    Certain of Torchmark's subsidiaries own and occupy buildings containing asbestos. These facilities are subject to regulations which could cause the Company to be required to remove and dispose of all or part of the asbestos upon the occurrence of certain events. Otherwise, the subsidiaries are under no obligation under the regulations. At this time, no such events under these regulations have occurred. For this reason, the Company has not recorded a liability for this potential obligation, as the time at which any obligation could be settled is not known. Therefore, there is insufficient information to estimate a fair value.
Asset Retirements:
 
    As of December 31, 2011, Torchmark had $293 million invested in limited partnerships that provide low-income housing tax credits and other related Federal income tax and state premium tax benefits to Torchmark. The carrying value of Torchmark's investment in these entities was $283 million at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, Torchmark was obligated under future commitments of $109 million, which amount is included in the above carrying value. Interests for which the return has been guaranteed by unrelated third-parties are accounted for using the effective-yield method. The remaining interests are accounted for using the amortized-cost method.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Interests:
 
For 2011 and 2010, the Federal income benefits accrued during the year, net of the amortization associated with guaranteed interests, were recorded in "Income taxes." Amortization associated with non-guaranteed interests and interests providing for state premium tax benefits was reflected as a component of "Net investment income." For years prior to 2010, the Federal income tax benefits accrued during the year, net of the amortization associated with all interests, were recorded in "Income taxes." All state premium tax benefits, net of the related amortization, were recorded in "Net investment income." At December 31, 2011, $281 million associated with the Federal interests was included in "Other assets" with the remaining $12 million state-related interests included in "Other invested assets." At December 31, 2010, the comparable amounts were $269 million and $14 million, respectively. Any unpaid commitments to invest are recorded in "Other liabilities." In the segment analysis, the amortization associated with the non-guaranteed interests is reflected as a component of "Income tax expenses," and not "Net investment income," consistent with the treatment of the guaranteed interests. Management views this presentation as a more accurate matching of costs with the associated revenues with respect to the low-income housing interests.
 
 
Note 1Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
    The excess cost of business acquired over the fair value of their net assets is reported as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing based on certain procedures outlined by GAAP. The procedures involve measuring the carrying value of each reporting unit of Torchmark's segments, including the goodwill of that unit, against the estimated fair value of the corresponding unit. If the carrying value of a unit including goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, then the goodwill in that unit could potentially be impaired. In that event, further testing is required under the accounting guidance to determine the amount of impairment, if any. If there is an impairment in the goodwill of any reporting unit, it is written down and charged to earnings in the period of test.
Goodwill:
 
Torchmark has tested its goodwill annually in each of the years 2009 through 2011. These tests involved assigning carrying value by allocating the Company's net assets to each of the reporting units of Torchmark's segments, including the portion of goodwill assigned to the unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using discounted expected cash flows associated with that unit. Judgment and assumptions are used in developing the projected cash flows for the reporting units, and such estimates are subject to change. The Company also exercises judgment in the determination of the discount rate, which management believes to be appropriate for the risk associated with the cash flow expectations. The fair value of each reporting unit is then measured against that reporting unit's corresponding carrying value. Because the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value, including goodwill, of each reporting unit in each period, Torchmark's goodwill was not impaired in any of those periods.
 
Torchmark accounts for purchases of treasury stock on the cost method. Issuance of treasury stock is accounted for using the weighted-average cost method.
Treasury Stock:    
 
    During 2011, Torchmark settled a state administrative matter involving issues arising over a period of many years. The settlement resulted in a pre-tax charge of $6.9 million ($4.5 million after tax). Additionally in 2011, the Company accrued an estimated liability for settlement of an insurance litigation matter expected to settle in 2012. The liability for this litigation, which arose many years ago, was estimated to be $12.0 million pretax ($7.8 million after tax). Please refer to in the for a discussion of the litigation settlement. In 2009, Torchmark recorded a $2.9 million tax settlement primarily resulting from the favorable settlements of U.S. Federal income tax issues that related to prior tax years. More information on this tax settlement is provided in . Management removes items that are related to prior periods when evaluating the operating results of current periods. Therefore, these items are excluded in its presentation of segment results as disclosed in , because accounting guidance requires that operating segment results be presented as management views its business.

Torchmark accounts for stock-based compensation by recognizing an expense in the financial statements based on the "fair value method." The fair value method requires that a fair value be assigned to a stock option or other stock grant on its grant date and that this value be amortized over the grantees' service period.
Stock Compensation:    
 
 
Note 1Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The fair value method requires the use of an option valuation model to value employee stock options. Torchmark has elected to use the Black-Scholes valuation model for option expensing. A summary of assumptions for options granted in each of the three years 2009 through 2011 is as follows:
 
 
The expected term is generally derived from Company experience. However, expected terms of grants made under the Torchmark Corporation 2005 Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) and the 2007 Long-Term Compensation Plan (2007 Plan), involving grants made in the years 2005 through 2010, were determined based on the simplified method as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110. This method was used because the 2005 and 2007 Plans limited grants to a maximum contract term of seven years, and Torchmark had no previous experience with seven-year contract terms. Prior to 2005, substantially all grants contained ten-year terms. Because a large portion of these grants vest over a three-year period, the Company did not have sufficient exercise history during 2010 or previous years to determine an appropriate expected term on these grants. Beginning in 2011, all grants with seven-year terms are based on Company experience. The Torchmark Corporation 2011 Incentive Plan replaced the previous plans and allows for option grants with a ten-year contractual term which vest over five years in addition to seven-year grants which vest over three years as permitted by the previous plans. The Company has no historical experience with five-year vesting, and will therefore use the simplified method to determine the expected term for these grants until such experience is developed. Volatility and risk-free interest rates are assumed over a period of time consistent with the expected term of the option. Volatility is measured on a historical basis. Monthly data points are utilized to derive volatility for periods greater than three years. Expected dividend yield is based on current dividend yield held constant over the expected term. Once the fair value of an option has been determined, it is amortized on a straight-line basis over the employee's service period for that grant (from the grant date to the date the grant is fully vested).
 
Torchmark management views all stock-based compensation expense as a corporate or Parent Company expense and, therefore, presents it as such in its segment analysis (See ). It is included in "Other operating expense" in the .

    Torchmark declared a three-for-two stock split paid in the form of a 50% stock dividend on all of the Company's outstanding common stock. The record date for the split was the close of business on June 1, 2011. On July 1, 2011, the payment date, holders of Torchmark common stock as of the record date received one additional share of stock for every two shares held. The Company paid $123 thousand in cash to acquire 2,841 fractional shares as a result of the split. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect this split for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. "Common stock" and "Retained earnings" presented for all prior periods in the accompanying and have also been retroactively adjusted to reflect this split.

Note 2Statutory Accounting
 
Life insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are required to file statutory financial statements with state insurance regulatory authorities. Accounting principles used to prepare these statutory financial statements differ from GAAP. Consolidated net income and shareholders' equity (capital and surplus) on a statutory basis for the insurance subsidiaries were as follows:
 
 
The excess, if any, of shareholder's equity of the insurance subsidiaries on a GAAP basis over that determined on a statutory basis is not available for distribution to Torchmark without regulatory approval. More information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends can be found in
Note 12Shareholders' Equity.
 
Torchmark's statutory financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting practices prescribed by the insurance department of the state of domicile of each insurance subsidiary. All states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) statutory accounting practices (NAIC SAP) as the basis for statutory accounting. However, certain states have retained the prescribed practices of their respective insurance code or administrative code which can differ from NAIC SAP. There are no significant differences between NAIC SAP and the accounting practices prescribed by the states of domicile for Torchmark's life insurance companies that affect statutory surplus.
 
 
Note 3Discontinued Operations
 
During the third quarter of 2010, Torchmark's subsidiary, Liberty, entered into an agreement to sell its wholly-owned subsidiary, United Investors Life Insurance Company (United Investors), to an unaffiliated insurance carrier. The sale was completed as of December 31, 2010. United Investors marketed primarily term and interest-sensitive life insurance, fixed annuities, and, prior to 2009, variable annuities. Consideration for the sale consisted of $343 million in cash at the closing, as well as post-closing proceeds receivable from the buyer of approximately $21 million which was received in early 2011. The transaction resulted in a pretax loss of approximately $38 million ($35 million after tax), which has been reported as a realized loss on the disposal of a discontinued operation in 2010. Due to the sale, Torchmark's consolidated financial statements are presented to reflect the transactions as discontinued operations.

    Torchmark measures the fair value of its financial assets based on a hierarchy consisting of three levels which indicate the quality of the fair value measurements as described below:
Fair value measurements:
 
 
 
 
The great majority of the Company's fixed maturities are not actively traded and direct quotes are not generally available. Management therefore determines the fair values of these securities after consideration of data provided by third-party pricing services and independent broker/dealers. Over 99% of the fair value reported at December 31, 2011 was determined using data provided by third-party pricing services. Prices provided by third-party pricing services are not binding offers but are estimated exit values. They are based on observable market data inputs which can vary by security type. Such inputs include benchmark yields, available trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market data. As part of the Company's controls over pricing, management reviews and analyzes all prices obtained to insure the reasonableness of the values, taking all available information into account. One very important control is the corroboration of prices obtained from third-party sources against other independent sources. When corroborated prices produce small variations, the close correlation indicates observable inputs, and the median value is used. When corroborated prices present greater variations, additional analysis is required to determine which value is the most appropriate. When only one price is available, management evaluates observable inputs and performs additional analysis to confirm that the price is appropriate. All fair value measurements based on prices determined with observable market data are reported as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements.
 
When third-party vendor prices are not available, the Company attempts to obtain at least three quotes from broker/dealers for each security. When at least three quotes are obtained, and the standard deviation of such quotes is less than 3%, (suggesting that the independent quotes were likely derived using similar observable inputs), the Company uses the median quote and classifies the measurement as Level 2. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no assets valued as Level 2 in this manner with broker quotes.
 
When the standard deviation is 3% or greater, or the Company cannot obtain three quotes, then additional information and management judgment are required to establish the fair value. The measurement is then classified as Level 3. The Company uses information and valuation techniques deemed appropriate for determining the point within the range of reasonable fair value estimates that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, fair value measurements classified as Level 3 represented 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively, of total fixed maturities and equity securities.

The following tables represent the fair value of assets measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
 
 
 
Note 4Investments (continued)
 
The following table represents changes in assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
 
 
 
The collateral underlying collateralized debt obligations for which fair values are reported as Level 3 consists primarily of trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. None of the collateral is subprime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower).
 
The following table presents transfers in and out of each of the valuation levels of fair values.
 
 
Transfers into Level 2 from Level 3 result from the availability of observable market data when a security is valued at the end of a period. Transfers into Level 3 occur when there is a lack of observable market information. Transfers into Level 1 from Level 2 occur when direct quotes are available; transfers from Level 1 into Level 2 result when only observable market data and no direct quotes are available.
 
 
Note 4Investments (continued)
 
    Torchmark's portfolio of fixed maturities fluctuates in value due to changes in interest rates in the financial markets as well as other factors. Fluctuations caused by market interest rate changes have little bearing on whether or not the investment will be ultimately recoverable. Therefore, Torchmark considers these declines in value resulting from changes in market interest rates to be temporary. In certain circumstances, however, Torchmark determines that the decline in the value of a security is other-than-temporary and writes the book value of the security down to its fair value, realizing an investment loss. The evaluation of Torchmark's securities for other-than-temporary impairments is a process that is undertaken not less frequently than quarterly and is overseen by a team of investment and accounting professionals. Each security which is impaired because the fair value is less than the cost or amortized cost is identified and evaluated. The determination that an impairment is other-than-temporary is highly subjective and involves the careful consideration of many factors. Among the factors considered are:
Other-than-temporary impairments:
 
The relative weight given to each of these factors can change over time as facts and circumstances change. In many cases, management believes it is appropriate to give relatively more weight to prospective factors than to retrospective factors. Prospective factors that are given more weight include prospects for recovery, the Company's ability and intent to hold the security until anticipated recovery, and expected future cash flows.
 
Among the facts and information considered in the process are:
 
While all available information is taken into account, it is difficult to predict the ultimately recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security.
 
 
Note 4Investments (continued)
 
Torchmark has determined that certain of its holdings in fixed maturity investments were other-than-temporarily impaired during the three years ended December 31, 2011. Included in the impairments were collateralized debt obligations in which the impairment was bifurcated in accordance with accounting guidance. As a result of this guidance, the portion of an impairment considered to be a credit loss is other-than-temporarily impaired and the amount of the credit loss is charged to net income. Any portion of the impairment considered to be temporary is charged to other comprehensive income. The credit loss portion of an impairment is determined as the difference between the security's amortized cost and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the securities' original effective yield rate. The temporary portion is the difference between this present value of expected future cash flows and fair value (as discounted by a market yield). The expected cash flows are determined using judgment and the best information available to the Company. Inputs used to derive expected cash flows include expected default rates, current levels of subordination, and loan-to-collateral value ratios. Management believes that the present value of future cash flows at the original effective yield is a better measure of valuation, because fair value is based on limited observable market data, and the market for these securities is neither active nor orderly. The following table presents the writedowns recorded due to these impairments in accordance with accounting guidance and whether the writedown was charged to earnings or other comprehensive income.
 
 
 
As of year end 2011, previously written down securities remaining in the portfolio were carried at a fair value of $22.6 million. Otherwise, as of December 31, 2011, Torchmark has no information available to cause it to believe that any of its investments are other-than-temporarily impaired. Torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these investments to recovery, and does not intend to sell nor expects to be required to sell its other impaired securities.
 
Bifurcated credit losses result when there is an other-than-temporary impairment for which a portion of the loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Torchmark's balances related to bifurcated credit loss positions included in other comprehensive income were $22 million at December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009. There was no change in this balance since December 31, 2009, the year the balance initially arose.
 
 
Note 4Investments (continued)
 
.    As conditions in financial markets have improved since early 2009, unrealized gains in the portfolio have occurred and losses have declined. Net unrealized losses on fixed maturities of $455 million at December 31, 2009 became net unrealized gains of $108 million at December 31, 2010. During 2011, net unrealized gains rose to $964 million at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, investments in securities in the financial sector were in a $14 million unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized loss position of $115 million at December 31, 2010. Investments in securities in the other sectors had net unrealized gains of $950 million in 2011 and $223 million in 2010. The following tables disclose gross unrealized investment losses by class of investment at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Torchmark considers these investments to be only temporarily impaired.
Unrealized gain/loss analysis
 
 
 
 
 
Note 4Investments (continued)
 
 
 
 
Additional information about investments in an unrealized loss position is as follows:
 
 
Torchmark's entire fixed-maturity and equity portfolio consisted of 1,373 issues at December 31, 2011 and 1,430 issues at December 31, 2010. The weighted-average quality rating of all unrealized loss positions as of December 31, 2011 was BBB-, compared with BBB+ a year earlier. The weighted-average quality ratings are based on amortized cost.
 
 
Note 4Investments (continued)
 
Other investment information:
 
Other long-term investments consist of the following:
 
 
The estimated fair value of mortgage loans, based on discounted cash flows, was approximately $0.6 million at December 31, 2011 and $14.3 million at December 31, 2010. Accumulated depreciation on investment real estate was $1.8 million at both December 31, 2011 and 2010.
 
Torchmark had $125 thousand in fixed maturities at book value ($130 thousand at fair value) that were non-income producing during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Torchmark had $3.0 million in investment real estate at December 31, 2011 which was non-income producing during the previous twelve months. Torchmark did not have any other invested assets that were non-income producing during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.
 
Note 5Deferred Acquisition Costs
 
An analysis of deferred acquisition costs is as follows:
 
 
 
In the event of lapses or early withdrawals in excess of those assumed, deferred acquisition costs may not be recoverable.
 
 
Note 6Future Policy Benefit Reserves
 
A summary of the assumptions used in determining the liability for future policy benefits at December 31, 2011 is as follows:
 
 
Interest assumptions:
 
Mortality assumptions:
 
For individual life, the mortality tables used are various statutory mortality tables and modifications of:
 
Withdrawal assumptions:
 
Withdrawal assumptions are based on Torchmark's experience.
 
 
Interest assumptions:
 
 
Morbidity assumptions:
 
For individual health, the morbidity assumptions are based on either Torchmark's experience or the assumptions used in calculating statutory reserves.
 
Termination assumptions:
 
Termination assumptions are based on Torchmark's experience.
 
Overall Interest Assumptions:
 
The overall average interest assumption for determining the liability for future life and health insurance benefits in 2011 was 5.9%.
 
 
Note 7Liability for Unpaid Health Claims
 
Activity in the liability for unpaid health claims is summarized as follows:
 
 
At the end of each period, the liability for unpaid health claims includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Such estimates are updated regularly based upon the Company's most recent claims data with recognition of emerging experience trends. Because of the nature of the Company's health business, the payment lags are relatively short and most claims are fully paid within a year from the time incurred. Fluctuations in claims experience can lead to either over- or under-estimation of the liability for any given year. The difference between the estimate made at the end of the prior period and the actual experience during the period is reflected above under the caption "Incurred related to: Prior years."
 
Claims paid in each of the years 2009 through 2011 were settled for amounts less than anticipated when estimated at the previous year end. The most significant components of these favorable variances were in Torchmark's UA Independent, Liberty National Branch, and Medicare Part D distribution channels. The Company's estimates at each point have reflected the emerging data and trends. In the Medicare Part D channel, the Company is required to estimate claim discounts that will be received from drug manufacturers. In each of the years 2009 through 2011, the discounts from the drug manufacturers received in the current year but related to prior year claims were higher than anticipated when the claim liability was determined.
 
The liability for unpaid health claims is included with "Policy claims and other benefits payable" on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
 
Note 8Income Taxes
 
Torchmark and its subsidiaries file a life-nonlife consolidated Federal income tax return.
 
The components of income taxes were as follows:
 
 
Income tax expense from continuing operations consists of:
 
 
In each of the years 2009 through 2011, deferred income tax expense was incurred because of certain differences between net income before income taxes as reported on the and taxable income as reported on Torchmark's income tax returns. As explained in these differences caused the financial statement book values of some assets and liabilities to be different from their respective tax bases.
Consolidated Statements of Operations
Note 1
Significant Accounting Policies,
 
The effective income tax rate differed from the expected 35% rate as shown below:
 
 
 
Note 8Income Taxes (continued)
 
The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below:
 
 
Torchmark's Federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS completed its examination of the Company's 2005, 2006, and 2007 tax years during 2009. The Company recorded a $2.5 million tax benefit to reflect the results of the examination, including a reduction in its liability for uncertain tax positions relating to these years. The statutes of limitation for the assessments of additional tax are closed for all tax years prior to 2008. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for any potential assessments that may result from future tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.
 
Torchmark has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $21 million at December 31, 2011 which will begin to expire in 2025 if not otherwise used to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is to be provided when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized by the Company. No valuation allowance has been recorded relating to Torchmark's deferred tax assets since, in management's judgment, Torchmark will more likely than not have sufficient taxable income in future periods to fully realize its existing deferred tax assets.
 
Torchmark's tax liability is adjusted to include the provision for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding effects of accrued interest, net of Federal tax benefits) for the years 2009 through 2011 is as follows:
 
 
Torchmark's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company recognized interest income of $0, $124 thousand, and $1.7 million, net of Federal income tax benefits, in its for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Company had an accrued interest receivable of $2.7 million and $4.1 million, net of Federal income tax expense, as of 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company had no accrued penalties at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
Consolidated Statements of Operations
 
 
Note 9Postretirement Benefits
 
Torchmark has noncontributory retirement benefit plans and contributory savings plans which cover substantially all employees. There are also two nonqualified, noncontributory supplemental benefit pension plans which cover a limited number of employees. The total cost of these retirement plans charged to operations was as follows:
Pension Plans:    
 
 
Torchmark accrues expense for the defined contribution plans based on a percentage of the employees' contributions. The plans are funded by the employee contributions and a Torchmark contribution equal to the amount of accrued expense. Plan contributions are both mandatory and discretionary, depending on the terms of the plan.
 
Cost for the defined benefit pension plans has been calculated on the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. All plan measurements for the defined benefit plans are as of December 31 of the respective year. The defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of employees are funded. Contributions are made to funded pension plans subject to minimums required by regulation and maximums allowed for tax purposes. Defined benefit plan contributions were $8.6 million in 2011, $13 million in 2010, and $15 million in 2009. Torchmark estimates as of December 31, 2011 that it will contribute an amount not to exceed $20 million to these plans in 2012. The actual amount of contribution may be different from this estimate.
 
Torchmark has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), which provides to a limited number of executives an additional supplemental defined pension benefit. The supplemental benefit is based on the participant's qualified plan benefit without consideration to the regulatory limits on compensation and benefit payments applicable to qualified plans, except that eligible compensation is capped at $1 million. The SERP is unfunded. However, life insurance policies on the lives of plan participants have been established for this plan with an unaffiliated insurance carrier. The premiums for this coverage paid in 2011 was $3.9 million and in 2010 was $1.7 million. The cash value of these policies at December 31, 2011 was $16 million and was $12 million a year earlier. Additionally, a Rabbi Trust was established for this plan in 2010 in the amount of $21 million to support the liability for this plan. An additional deposit of $5 million was added to this trust in 2011 and an investment account was established. As of December 31, 2011, the combined value of the insurance policies and the trust investments was $43 million. Because this plan is unqualified, the Rabbi Trust and the policyholder value of these policies are not included as defined benefit plan assets but as assets of the Company. The liability for this SERP at December 31, 2011 was $47 million and was $38 million a year earlier.
 
The other supplemental benefit pension plan is limited to a very select group of employees and was closed as of December 31, 1994. It provides the full benefits that an employee would have otherwise received from a defined benefit plan in the absence of the limitation on benefits payable under a qualified plan. This plan is unfunded. Liability for this closed plan was $3 million at December 31, 2011 and $4 million at December 31, 2010. Pension cost for both supplemental defined benefit plans is determined in the same manner as for the qualified defined benefit plans.
 
Plan assets in the funded plans consist primarily of investments in marketable fixed maturities and equity securities and are valued at fair value. Torchmark measures the fair value of its financial assets, including the assets in its benefit plans, in accordance with accounting guidance which establishes a hierarchy for asset values and provides a methodology for the measurement of value. Please refer to under the caption for a complete discussion of valuation procedures. The following table presents the assets of Torchmark's defined benefit pension plans for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Note 9Postretirement Benefits (continued)
 
 
 
 
 
Note 9Postretirement Benefits (continued)
 
Torchmark's investment objectives for its plan assets include preservation of capital, preservation of purchasing power, and long-term growth. Torchmark seeks to preserve capital through investments made in high quality securities with adequate diversification by issuer and industry sector to minimize risk. The portfolio is monitored continuously for changes in quality and diversification mix. The preservation of purchasing power is intended to be accomplished through asset growth, exclusive of contributions and withdrawals, in excess of the rate of inflation. Torchmark intends to maintain investments that when combined with future plan contributions will produce adequate long-term growth to provide for all plan obligations. The Company's expectation for the portfolio is to achieve a compound total rate of return of 3% in excess of the inflation rate, to be reviewed on a three-year basis. It is also Torchmark's objective that the portfolio's investment return will meet or exceed the return of a balanced market index.
 
The majority of the securities in the portfolio are highly marketable so that there will be adequate liquidity to meet projected payments. There are no specific policies calling for asset durations to match those of benefit obligations.
 
Allowed investments are limited to equities, fixed maturities, and short-term investments (invested cash). There is also a guaranteed annuity contract to fund the obligations of the American Income Pension Plan. The assets are to be invested in a mix of equity and fixed income investments that best serve the objectives of the pension plan. Factors to be considered in determining the asset mix include funded status, annual pension expense, annual pension contributions, and balance sheet liability. Equities include common and preferred stocks, securities convertible into equities, mutual funds that invest in equities, and other equity-related investments. Equities must be listed on major exchanges and adequate market liquidity is required. Fixed maturities consist of marketable debt securities rated investment grade at purchase by a major rating agency. Short-term investments include fixed maturities with maturities less than one year and invested cash. Short-term investments in commercial paper must be rated at least A-2 by Standard & Poor's with the issuer rated investment grade. Invested cash is limited to banks rated A or higher. Investments outside of the aforementioned list are not permitted, except by prior approval of the Plan's Trustees. At December 31, 2011, there were no restricted investments contained in the portfolio. Plan contributions have been invested primarily in fixed maturities during the three years ending December 31, 2011.
 
The investment portfolio is to be well diversified to avoid undue exposure to a single sector, industry, business, or security. The equity and fixed-maturity portfolios are not permitted to invest in any single issuer that would exceed 10% of total plan assets at the time of purchase. Torchmark does not employ any other special risk management techniques, such as derivatives, in managing the pension investment portfolio.
 
 
Note 9Postretirement Benefits (continued)
 
The following table discloses the assumptions used to determine Torchmark's pension liabilities and costs for the appropriate periods. The discount and compensation increase rates are used to determine current year projected benefit obligations and subsequent year pension expense. The long-term rate of return is used to determine current year expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are included in actuarial gain or loss.
 
 
 
The discount rate is determined based on the expected duration of plan liabilities. A yield is then derived based on the current market yield of a hypothetical portfolio of higher-quality corporate bonds which match the liability duration. The rate of compensation increase is projected based on Company experience, modified as appropriate for future expectations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is management's best estimate of the average rate of earnings expected to be received on the assets invested in the plan over the benefit period. In determining this assumption, consideration is given to the historical rate of return earned on the assets, the projected returns over future periods, and the spread between the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to compute benefit obligations.
 
Net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit plans by expense component was as follows:
 
 
An analysis of the impact on other comprehensive income (loss) concerning pensions is as follows:
 
 
 
Note 9Postretirement Benefits (continued)
 
The following table presents a reconciliation from the beginning to the end of the year of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets. This table also presents the amounts previously recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
 
 
The portion of other comprehensive income that is expected to be reflected in pension expense in 2012 is as follows:
 
 
The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for Torchmark's funded defined benefit pension plans was $263 million and $228 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In the unfunded plans, the ABO was $39 million and $32 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Torchmark has estimated its expected pension benefits to be paid over the next ten years as of December 31, 2011. These estimates use the same assumptions that measure the benefit obligation at December 31, 2011, taking estimated future employee service into account. Those estimated benefits are as follows:
 
 
 
Note 9Postretirement Benefits (continued)
 
Torchmark provides a small postretirement life insurance benefit for most retired employees, and also provides additional postretirement life insurance benefits for certain key employees. The majority of the life insurance benefits are accrued over the working lives of active employees. Otherwise, Torchmark does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions and the life insurance benefits described above.
Postretirement Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions:    
 
Torchmark's post-retirement defined benefit plans other than pensions are not funded. Liabilities for these plans are measured as of December 31 for the appropriate year.
 
The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for plans other than pensions are as follows:
 
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the benefit obligation and plan assets from the beginning to the end of the year. As these plans are unfunded, funded status is equivalent to the accrued benefit liability.

During 2006, Torchmark established Torchmark Capital Trust III (Trust III) to facilitate the public offering of 4.8 million shares of $25 par value Trust Preferred Securities. Trust III completed the offering for total proceeds of $120 million. It then exchanged $3.7 million of its common stock and the $120 million of proceeds from the offering for $124 million of Torchmark Junior Subordinated Debentures, due June 1, 2046. Trust III pays quarterly dividends on the Trust Preferred Securities at an annual rate of 7.1%, and receives quarterly payments at the same annual rate from Torchmark on the Junior Subordinated Debentures. All payments due to be paid by Trust III on the Trust Preferred Securities are guaranteed by Torchmark (see ). The securities are redeemable on June 1, 2046. They are callable by Trust III at any time.
Funded debt:    
Note 15
 
Trust III is a variable interest entity in which Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, Torchmark is prohibited by accounting rules from consolidating Trust III even though it has 100% ownership, complete voting control, and has guaranteed the performance of Trust III. Accordingly,
 
 
Note 11Debt (continued)
 
Torchmark carries its 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to Trust III as a liability under the caption "Due to Affiliates" on its . Expenses related to the offering reduce long-term debt and are amortized over the forty-year redemption period.
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 
On June 30, 2009, Torchmark issued $300 million principal amount of 9.25% Senior Notes due June 15, 2019. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually commencing on December 15, 2009. Proceeds from the issuance of this debt, net of expenses, were $296 million. The Notes are redeemable by Torchmark in whole or in part at any time subject to a "make-whole" premium, whereby the Company would be required to pay the greater of the full principal amount of the Notes or otherwise the present value of the remaining repayment schedule of the Notes discounted at a rate of interest equivalent to the rate of a United States Treasury security of comparable term plus a spread of 75 basis points. Torchmark used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay its $99 million 8

% Senior Notes ($7.3 million book value) at a cost of $8.9 million. This repurchase resulted in a pre-tax loss of $1.6 million ($1.1 million after tax).
 
In December, 2010, Torchmark entered into a credit facility with a group of lenders allowing unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. The facility includes a provision which allows Torchmark to increase the facility limit by $200 million if certain conditions are met. The Company also has the ability to request up to $250 million in letters of credit to be issued against the facility. The agreement is set to terminate on January 7, 2015. The credit facility is further designated as a back-up credit line for a commercial paper program, where Torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time, with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility limit less any letters of credit issued. Interest is charged at variable rates. At December 31, 2011, Torchmark had $225 million face amount ($225 million carrying amount) of commercial paper outstanding, $198 million of letters of credit issued, and no borrowings under the line of credit. During 2011, the short term borrowings under the facility averaged approximately $206 million, and were made at an average yield of .4%, compared with an average balance of $196 million and also at an average yield of .4% a year earlier. The facility does not have a ratings-based acceleration trigger which would require early payment. A facility fee is charged for the entire facility.There is also an issuance fee for letters of credit issued. Torchmark is subject to certain covenants for the agreements regarding capitalization and earnings, with which it was in compliance at December 31, 2011 and throughout the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. Borrowings on the credit facilities are reported as short-term debt on the

Note 12Shareholders' Equity
 
A summary of preferred and common share activity is as follows:
Share Data:
 
 
 
Torchmark shares are acquired from time to time through open market purchases under the Torchmark stock repurchase program when it is believed to be the best use of Torchmark's excess cash flows. Torchmark suspended its share repurchase program temporarily from the first quarter of 2009 until the first quarter of 2010 because of uncertain economic conditions. Share repurchases under this program were 18.9 million shares at a cost of $788 million in 2011, 5.7 million shares at a cost of $204 million in 2010, and 3.1 million shares at a cost of $47 million in 2009. When stock options are exercised, proceeds from the exercises are generally used to repurchase approximately the number of shares available with those funds in order to reduce dilution. Shares repurchased for dilution purposes were 4.4 million shares at a cost of $185 million in 2011, 1.1 million shares at a cost of $42 million in 2010, and 30 thousand shares at a cost of $869 thousand in 2009.
Acquisition of Common Shares:    
 
Torchmark retired 7.5 million shares of treasury stock in 2011, 6 million in 2010, and 3 million in 2009.
Retirement of Treasury Stock:    
 
Restrictions exist on the flow of funds to Torchmark from its insurance subsidiaries. Statutory regulations require life insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus. Dividends from insurance subsidiaries of Torchmark are limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains on an annual noncumulative basis, or 10% of prior year surplus, in the absence of special regulatory approval. Additionally, insurance company distributions are generally not permitted in excess of statutory surplus. Subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements. In 2011, subsidiaries of Torchmark paid $769 million in dividends to the parent company, including $305 million available from the proceeds from the sale of United Investors. During 2012, a maximum amount of $470 million is expected to be available to Torchmark in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries without regulatory approval.
Restrictions:    
 
 
Note 12Shareholders' Equity (continued)
 
A reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows, retroactively adjusted for the three-for-two stock split:
Earnings Per Share:    
 
 
Stock options to purchase 3.5 million shares, 10.3 million shares, and 14.1 million shares, during the years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, are considered to be anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Income available to common shareholders for basic earnings per share is equivalent to income available to common shareholders for diluted earnings per share.
 
Note 13Stock-Based Compensation

Certain employees, directors, and consultants have been granted fixed equity options to buy shares of Torchmark stock at the market value of the stock on the date of grant, under the provisions of the Torchmark stock option plans. The options are exercisable during the period commencing from the date they vest until expiring according to the terms of the grant. Options generally expire the earlier of employee termination or option contract term, which ranges from seven to eleven years. Employee and consultant stock options generally vest one-half in two years and one-half in three years. Director grants generally vest in six months. Stock options awarded in connection with compensation deferrals by certain directors and executives generally vest over a range of ten years. Beginning in 2011, with the approval by Shareholders of the Torchmark Corporation 2011 Incentive Plan, some employee grants vest one-fourth over two years and the remaining three-fourths vest one-fourth over each of the next three years. All employee options vest immediately upon retirement on or after the attainment of age 65. Torchmark generally issues shares for the exercise of stock options from treasury stock. The Company generally uses the proceeds from option exercises to buy shares of Torchmark common stock in the open market to reduce the dilution from option exercises.

Note 14Business Segments
 
Torchmark's reportable segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance, health insurance, and annuities. These major product lines are set out as reportable segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management techniques. There is also an investment segment which manages the investment portfolio, debt, and cash flow for the insurance segments and the corporate function. Torchmark's chief operating decision maker evaluates the overall performance of the operations of the Company in accordance with these segments.
 
Life insurance products include traditional and interest-sensitive whole life insurance as well as term life insurance. Health products are generally guaranteed-renewable and include Medicare Supplement, Medicare Part D, cancer, accident, long-term care, and limited-benefit hospital and surgical coverages. Annuities include fixed-benefit contracts.
 
 
Note 14Business Segments (continued)
 
Torchmark markets its insurance products through a number of distribution channels, each of which sells the products of one or more of Torchmark's insurance segments. The tables below present segment premium revenue by each of Torchmark's marketing groups.
 
 
 
Because of the nature of the life insurance industry, Torchmark has no individual or group which would be considered a major customer. Substantially all of Torchmark's business is conducted in the United States, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern regions.
 
The measure of profitability established by the chief operating decision maker for insurance segments is underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses, in accordance with the manner the segments are managed. It essentially represents gross profit margin on insurance products before insurance administrative expenses and consists of premium, less net policy obligations, acquisition expenses, and commissions. Interest credited to net policy liabilities (reserves less deferred acquisition costs) is reflected as a component of the Investment segment in order to match this cost to the investment earnings from the assets supporting the net policy liabilities.
 
 
Note 14Business Segments (continued)
 
The measure of profitability for the Investment segment is excess investment income, which represents the income earned on the investment portfolio in excess of net policy requirements and financing costs associated with Torchmark's debt. Other than the above-mentioned interest allocations and an intersegment commission, there are no other intersegment revenues or expenses. Expenses directly attributable to corporate operations are included in the "Corporate" category. Stock-based compensation expense is considered a corporate expense by Torchmark management and is included in this category. All other unallocated revenues and expenses on a pretax basis, including insurance administrative expense, are included in the "Other" segment category. The following tables set forth a reconciliation of Torchmark's revenues and operations by segment to its major income statement line items.
 
 
 
 
Note 14Business Segments (continued)
 
 
 
 
Note 14Business Segments (continued)
 
 
 
Torchmark holds a sizeable investment portfolio to support its insurance liabilities, the yield from which is used to offset policy benefit, acquisition, administrative and tax expenses. This yield or investment income is taken into account when establishing premium rates and profitability expectations of its insurance products. In holding such a portfolio, investments are sold, called, or written down from time to time, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains or losses generally occur as a result of disposition due to issuer calls, a downgrade in credit quality, compliance with Company investment policies, or other reasons often beyond management's control. Unlike investment income, realized gains and losses are incidental to insurance operations, and only overall yields are considered when setting premium rates or insurance product profitability expectations. While these gains and losses are not relevant to segment profitability or core operating results, they can have a material positive or negative result on net income. For these reasons, management removes realized investment gains and losses when it views its segment operations.
 
 
Note 14Business Segments (continued)
 
The following table summarizes the measures of segment profitability as determined in the three preceding tables for comparison with prior periods. The table also reconciles segment profits to net income.
 
 
 
 
 
Note 14Business Segments (continued)
 
Assets for each segment are reported based on a specific identification basis. The insurance segments' assets contain deferred acquisition costs (including the value of insurance purchased). The investment segment includes the investment portfolio, cash, and accrued investment income. Goodwill is assigned to the insurance segments at the time of purchase based on the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired for the benefit of that segment. All other assets, representing approximately 4% of total assets, are included in the other category. The table below reconciles segment assets to total assets as reported in the consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 15Commitments and Contingencies
 
Insurance affiliates of Torchmark reinsure that portion of insurance risk which is in excess of their retention limits. Retention limits for ordinary life insurance range up to $2.0 million per life. Life insurance ceded represented .5% of total life insurance in force at December 31, 2011. Insurance ceded on life and accident and health products represented .3% of premium income for 2011. Torchmark would be liable for the reinsured risks ceded to other companies to the extent that such reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations.
Reinsurance:    
 
Insurance affiliates also assume insurance risks of other companies. Life reinsurance assumed represented 3.0% of life insurance in force at December 31, 2011 and reinsurance assumed on life and accident and health products represented 1.2% of premium income for 2011.
 
Torchmark leases office space and office equipment under a variety of operating lease arrangements. Rental expense for operating leases was $4.8 million in 2011, $4.9 million in 2010, and $4.9 million in 2009. Future minimum rental commitments required under operating leases having remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2011 were as follows: 2012, $2.7 million; 2013, $2.4 million; 2014, $2.0 million; 2015, $2.0 million; 2016, $1.4 million and in the aggregate, $13.2 million.
Leases:    
 
    As described in , Torchmark has $293 million invested in entities which provide certain tax benefits. As of December 31, 2011, Torchmark remained obligated under these commitments for $109 million, of which $85 million is due in 2012, $21 million in 2013, $2 million in 2014, and $1 million thereafter.

Torchmark maintains a diversified investment portfolio with limited concentration in any given issuer. At December 31, 2011, the investment portfolio, at fair value, consisted of the following:
Concentrations of Credit Risk:    
 
 
As of December 31, 2011, securities of state and municipal governments represented 11% of invested assets at fair value. Such investments are made throughout the U.S. At year-end 2011, 5% or more of the state and municipal bond portfolio at fair value was invested in securities issued within the following states: Texas (34%), Ohio (8%), Washington (7%), and Alabama (5%). Otherwise, there was no significant concentration within any given state.
 
 
Note 15Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
Corporate debt and equity investments are made in a wide range of industries. Below are the ten largest industry concentrations held in the corporate portfolio at December 31, 2011, based on fair value:
 
 
At year-end 2011, 5% of invested assets at fair value was represented by fixed maturities rated below investment grade (BB or lower as determined by the weighted average of available ratings from rating services). Par value of these investments was $787 million, amortized cost was $701 million, and fair value was $579 million. While these investments could be subject to additional credit risk, such risk should generally be reflected in their fair value.
 
Torchmark requires collateral for investments in instruments where collateral is available and is typically required because of the nature of the investment. Torchmark's mortgages are secured by the underlying real estate.
Collateral Requirements:    
 
At December 31, 2011, Torchmark had in place four guarantee agreements, all of which were either parent company guarantees of subsidiary obligations to a third party, or parent company guarantees of obligations between wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2011, Torchmark had no liability with respect to these guarantees.
Guarantees:    
 
:    Torchmark entered into a performance guarantee for the obligations of the Torchmark Capital Trust III when the trust preferred securities were issued by that trust. It guarantees payment of distributions and the redemption price of the securities until the securities are redeemed in full, or all obligations have been satisfied should Trust III default on an obligation. The total redemption price of the trust preferred securities is $120 million.
Trust Preferred Securities
 
:    Torchmark has guaranteed letters of credit in connection with its credit facility with a group of banks. The letters of credit were issued by TMK Re, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to secure TMK Re, Ltd.'s obligation for claims on certain policies reinsured by TMK Re, Ltd. that were sold by other Torchmark insurance companies. These letters of credit facilitate TMK Re, Ltd.'s ability to reinsure the business of Torchmark's insurance carriers. The agreement expires in 2015. The maximum amount of letters of credit available is $250 million. Torchmark (parent company) would be liable to the extent that TMK Re, Ltd. does not pay the reinsured party. At December 31, 2011, $198 million of letters of credit were outstanding.
Letters of Credit
 
 
Note 15Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
:    Torchmark has guaranteed performance of a subsidiary as lessee under two leasing arrangements for aviation equipment. One of the leases commenced in 2003 for a lease term of approximately 10 years and the other was entered into in 2009 also for 10 years. Torchmark has certain renewal and early termination options under the first lease. At December 31, 2011, total remaining undiscounted payments under the leases were approximately $8 million. Torchmark (parent company) would be responsible for any subsidiary obligation in the event the subsidiary did not make payments or otherwise perform under the terms of the lease.
Equipment leases
 
     Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark's subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark's financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as Alabama and Mississippi. Torchmark's management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, particularly Alabama and Mississippi, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit.
Litigation:
 
As previously disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), United American was named as a defendant in purported class action litigation originally filed on September 16, 2004, in the Circuit Court of Saline County, Arkansas on behalf of the Arkansas purchasers of association group health insurance policies or certificates issued by United American through Heartland Alliance of America Association and Farm & Ranch Healthcare, Inc. (CV2004-742-2). The plaintiffs asserted claims for fraudulent concealment, breach of contract, common law liability for non-disclosure, breach of fiduciary duties, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and violation of Arkansas law and the rules and regulations of the Arkansas Insurance Department. Declaratory, injunctive and equitable relief, as well as actual and punitive damages were sought by the plaintiffs. On September 7, 2005, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to assert a nation-wide class, defined as all United American insureds who simultaneously purchased both an individual Hospital and Surgical Expense health insurance policy (Form HSXC) and an individual supplemental term life insurance policy (Form RT85) from Farm & Ranch through Heartland. Defendants removed this litigation to the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas (No. 4:05-cv-1382) but that Court remanded the litigation back to the state court on plaintiffs' motion. On July 22, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, asserting a class defined as "all persons who, between January 1998 and the present, were residents of Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana or Texas, and purchased through Farm & Ranch: (1) a health insurance policy issued by United American known as Flexguard Plan, CS-1 Common Sense Plan, GSP Good Sense Plan, SHXC Surgical & Hospital Expense Policy, HSXC 7500 Hospital/Surgical Plan, MMXC Hospital/Surgical Plan, SMXC Surgical/Medical Expense Plan and/or SSXC Surgical Safeguard Expense Plan, and (ii) a membership in Heartland." Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract, violation of Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and/or applicable consumer protection laws in other states, unjust enrichment, and common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek actual, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, equitable and declaratory relief. On September 8, 2009, the Saline County Circuit Court granted the plaintiff's motion certifying the class. On October 7, 2009, United American filed its notice of appeal of the class certification and subsequently filed its appellate brief on April 8, 2010. On December 2, 2010, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision to certify the class. On January 6, 2012, the parties agreed in principal to settle the case. On January 11, 2012, the Court ordered the continuation of the trial, previously set to commence on January 17, 2012, pending notice to the class and the Court's consideration of the agreed-upon settlement.
Smith and Ivie v. Collingsworth, et al.,
 
 
Note 15Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
On March 15, 2011, purported class action litigation was filed against American Income and Torchmark in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (, Case No. 1:11-cv-00533). The plaintiff, a formerly independently contracted American Income agent, alleges that American Income intentionally misclassified its agents as independent contractors rather than as employees in order to escape minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as to avoid payroll taxes, workers compensation premiums and other benefits required to be provided by employers. Monetary damages in the amount of unpaid compensation plus liquidated damages and/or prejudgment interest as well as injunctive and/or declaratory relief is sought by the plaintiff on behalf of the purported class. On November 3, 2011, the Court granted American Income's motion to compel arbitration and dismissed the case. Plaintiffs have appealed this decision.
Fitzhugh v. American Income Life Insurance Company and Torchmark Corporation
 
Torchmark subsidiary, United American was named as defendant in purported class action litigation filed on May 31, 2011 in Cross County Arkansas Circuit Court ((Case # CV-2011-84-5)In the litigation, filed on behalf of a proposed nationwide class of owners of certain limited hospital and surgical expense benefit policies from United American, the plaintiff alleged that United American breached the policy by failing and/or refusing to pay benefits for the total number of days an insured is confined to a hospital and by limiting payment to the number of days for which there are incurred hospital room charges rather than also including benefits for services and supplies. Claims for unjust enrichment, breach of contract, bad faith refusal to pay first party benefits, breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, bad faith, and violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act were initially asserted. The plaintiff sought declaratory relief, restitution and/or monetary damages, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees. In September 2011, the plaintiff dismissed all causes of action, except for the breach of contract claim.
Kennedy v. United American Insurance Company
.
 
On November 14, 2011, plaintiff filed an amended complaint based upon the same facts asserting only breach of contract claims on behalf of a purported nationwide restitution/monetary relief class or, in the first alternative, a purported multiple-state restitution/monetary relief class or, in the second alternative, a purported Arkansas statewide restitution/monetary relief class. Restitution and/or monetary relief for United American's alleged breaches of contract, costs, attorney's fees and expenses, expert fees, prejudgment interest and other relief are sought on behalf of the plaintiff and members of the class. On December 7, 2011, United American filed a Motion to Dismiss the plaintiff's amended complaint and on January 11, 2012, plaintiff filed a response thereto. Discovery has commenced and is ongoing.
