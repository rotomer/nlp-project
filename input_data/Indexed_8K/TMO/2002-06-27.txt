THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant On June 21, 2002, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Thermo Electron Corporation (the "Company") decided to no longer engage Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen" or "AA") as the Company's independent public accountants and engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") to serve as the Company's independent public accountants for the fiscal year 2002. Arthur Andersen's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for each of the last two completed fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except for an explanatory paragraph concerning the adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." During the last two completed fiscal years and through the date hereof, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to AA's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of AA's letter, dated June 25, 2002, stating its agreement with such statements. During the last two completed fiscal years and through the date hereof, the Company did not consult PwC with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
