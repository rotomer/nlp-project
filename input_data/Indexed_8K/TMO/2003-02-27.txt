Exhibit 99 Thermo Electron Reports Strong Fourth Quarter 2002 Results WALTHAM, Mass. (February 5, 2003) - Thermo Electron Corporation (NYSE:TMO) today reported GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $.51 for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared with a $.04 loss in the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were $569 million in 2002, up 2 percent from $560 million in the same period in 2001. Eliminating favorable currency effects of 4 percent and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, organic revenues declined by 2 percent. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 6.8 percent in 2002, versus negative 8.7 percent in 2001. In order for investors to gain a better understanding of our operating results, we believe it is useful to present our financial results on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, consistent with how we measure our operating performance. In this regard, adjusted EPS increased 24 percent to $.31 for the fourth quarter of 2002, versus $.25 in the same period of 2001. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 12.1 percent in 2002, versus 11.5 percent in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin (detailed in the accompanying schedules) exclude inventory charges, primarily for abandoned product lines; restructuring and other costs/income; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; certain other income; gain/loss on disposal of discontinued operations; extraordinary item; and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. For the 12 months ended December 28, 2002, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.73, versus breakeven results in 2001. Adjusted EPS rose 11 percent to $.99 in 2002, up from $.89 in 2001. Revenues declined by 5 percent to $2.09 billion in 2002, from $2.19 billion in 2001. Eliminating favorable currency effects of 1 percent and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, organic revenues also declined by 5 percent. GAAP operating margin was 7.5 percent in 2002, versus 1.6 percent in 2001. Adjusted operating margin was 10.8 percent in 2002, versus 11.0 percent in 2001. "We are pleased to report strong EPS growth in both the quarter and the full year, despite continued pressure on the top line, as well as solid operating cash flow of $60 million from continuing operations in the fourth quarter," said Marijn E. Dekkers, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Electron. "We continue to experience softness in many of the markets we serve; nevertheless, our productivity initiatives are contributing directly to bottom-line growth and we expect this to continue in 2003. Further, we're harnessing the best of what we have to offer across Thermo in order to serve customers better and more efficiently. We have innovative new products and services in the pipeline, unparalleled depth and breadth of capabilities, and we are leveraging our expertise across the company to offer broader, more integrated solutions to meet our customers' evolving needs." Commenting on earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2003 as well as for the full year, Mr. Dekkers said, "While we're not counting on improvement in the top line in the near-term given the economic uncertainty, we believe that we are well positioned to make continued progress on the bottom line. Our goal is to deliver EPS of $.22 to $.24 for the first quarter of 2003, and $1.07 to $1.12 for the full year, excluding the items detailed above in the description of adjusted EPS." It is not feasible to provide meaningful GAAP EPS guidance because many of the items we have excluded are difficult to estimate -more-
and primarily dependent on future events, such as decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations, and on market conditions that affect the timing and proceeds from the sale of our remaining equity interests. Sector Results Please Note: Improvement in all three sectors' GAAP results was due in part to significant restructuring charges in the 2001 period and the absence of goodwill amortization in the 2002 period due to the adoption in 2002 of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." See the accompanying schedules for details. Organic revenue growth figures exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency translation. Life and Laboratory Sciences Fourth quarter 2002 revenues for the Life and Laboratory Sciences sector were $314 million, versus $305 million in 2001, with organic revenues down 1 percent. We had strong shipments of chromatography systems, magnetic-sector mass spectrometry instruments, and laboratory information management systems (LIMS). These increases were offset by lower sales at our business that provides turnkey laboratories in emerging economies, which had a particularly strong fourth quarter in 2001, and continued softness in our laboratory-equipment business. Productivity initiatives led to significant improvements in both GAAP and adjusted operating margins. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was 15.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002, versus 4.6 percent in 2001. Adjusted operating margin rose 200 basis-points to 19.6 percent for the quarter, up from 17.6 percent in 2001. We continue to innovate, with new customer-focused products that have been well received in the marketplace, including the TraceTM DSQ single quadrupole GC/MS system launched earlier this year, and the Shandon ExcelsiorTM Tissue Processor, a fully automatic solution for tissue processing and reagent storage and handling, which features improved processing quality and enhanced safety. We dedicate significant resources to R&D to ensure we remain on the cutting edge of technology, and we believe customers will be impressed by the host of new products we will introduce at Pittcon this March. Measurement and Control Fourth quarter 2002 revenues for the Measurement and Control sector were $171 million, versus $155 million in 2001, with organic revenues up 7 percent. We saw strong demand for our explosives trace detection equipment, driven by the congressional mandate to screen 100 percent of all checked airline baggage by the end of the 2002, and modest improvement in sales of process instruments to food and beverage and pharmaceutical customers - offset by continued weak general demand in other industrial manufacturing markets. GAAP operating margin was 6.4 percent for the 2002 quarter, versus a negative 3.4 percent in the previous year. Adjusted operating margin was 11.1 percent in 2002, up from 10.1 percent in 2001, due to higher revenues and successful productivity and integration initiatives. Our July acquisition of Saint-Gobain's radiation-monitoring products business has exceeded expectations for revenues and earnings. We continue to see strong sales of our expanded line of radiation-monitoring products used in security applications to protect public safety at borders, airports, seaports, freight and shipping facilities, and other public venues. Optical Technologies Fourth quarter 2002 revenues for the Optical Technologies sector were $86 million, versus a particularly strong quarter in 2001 of $102 million. The continued weakness in the worldwide semiconductor market and slow economic conditions for our industrial customers affected the entire sector, and organic revenues were down 16 percent. GAAP operating margin was negative 5.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2002, versus negative 41.9 percent in 2001. Adjusted operating margin for the sector was 4.0 percent in the 2002 quarter, compared with 5.3 percent in 2001. -more-
