Exhibit 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact Information: J. Timothy Corcoran Phone: 781-622-1111 E-mail: tim.corcoran@thermo.com Website: www.thermo.com Thermo Electron Reports Third Quarter 2003 Results WALTHAM, Mass. (October 21, 2003) - Thermo Electron Corporation (NYSE:TMO) today reported that GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased to $.29 in the third quarter of 2003, compared with $.23 in the year-ago period. Earnings in 2003 included significant after-tax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations. Revenues were $497.1 million in 2003, versus $517.2 million in 2002. Organic revenues declined 7 percent. Organic revenues exclude the effect of currency translation (which increased revenues by 4 percent) and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 8.5 percent in 2003, versus 8.7 percent a year ago. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2003 rose 8 percent to $.27, compared with $.25 in 2002. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points to 11.9 percent in 2003, compared with 10.8 percent a year ago. Adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes income from the sale of shares of FLIR Systems and Thoratec Corporation, gains/losses on the early retirement of debt, gains/losses on disposal of discontinued operations, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, and benefit from tax credit carryforwards. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the accompanying table entitled "Consolidated Statement of Income." Marijn E. Dekkers, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Electron, said, "Our earnings improvement continues to gain momentum, with increases in productivity outweighing persistent industry challenges. We are particularly pleased with the rise in our adjusted operating margins, which were up significantly both year-to-year and sequentially. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic that the general tone of business is improving, evidenced by our significantly stronger book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. "While productivity improvement remains an important objective, our primary focus is on driving revenue growth - both organically and through acquisitions. We are aggressively pursuing numerous commercial initiatives to stimulate growth. In our Life and Laboratory Sciences sector, for example, we are now packaging complete solutions under a single Thermo brand, working in partnership with our customers to help them equip their laboratories. We also recently announced the acquisition of Jouan SA, a $92 million business that expands our sample preparation and storage product line and adds distribution channels in emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, Russia, and Latin America. We expect to complete this acquisition by year-end."
Mr. Dekkers continued, "Going into the fourth quarter of 2003, we expect our earnings improvement trend to continue. Our goal is to report $.32 to $.34 in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and $1.07 to $1.09 for the full year." This guidance excludes $.01 of expense per quarter from the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and also excludes restructuring and other costs/income and gains and losses from the sale of businesses, real estate, and our remaining interest in Thoratec, as well as unusual items we may have in the future. Life and Laboratory Sciences Third quarter 2003 revenues for the Life and Laboratory Sciences sector increased slightly to $301 million; organic revenues declined 3 percent. Ongoing weakness in industrial markets for instrumentation and scientific equipment was offset in part by higher sales of clinical diagnostics and laboratory informatics products during the quarter. GAAP operating margin was 14.5 percent in the third quarter of 2003, up from 14.3 percent a year ago. Adjusted operating margin improved to 16.7 percent, compared with 16.0 percent in 2002, resulting from productivity gains. We continue to make good progress in positioning Thermo as the premier supplier of laboratory products and services. New products, such as the Finnigan LTQ-FT Fourier-transform mass spectrometer introduced earlier this year, are generating strong orders. In the quarter, we accelerated efforts to integrate our commercial organization and opened One Thermo customer demonstration centers in Frankfurt, Paris, and Beijing. We also formed a strategic alliance with Qiagen N.V., a leading supplier of innovative products for nucleic acid separation, purification, and handling, to co-market related technologies for use in life sciences research and molecular diagnostics. Measurement and Control Revenues in the Measurement and Control sector were $147 million in the third quarter of 2003, versus $155 million in 2002; organic revenues declined 8 percent. Although many process markets we serve remain weak, some specific markets, such as the steel industry, are showing positive signs. In addition, homeland security initiatives continue to generate strong sales. GAAP operating margin increased to 7.4 percent in 2003, versus 5.6 percent a year ago. Adjusted operating margin was 9.6 percent, compared with 9.4 percent in 2002. To sharpen the sector's market focus, we acquired Siemens' Electronic Personal Dosimetry business, which broadens our radiation-monitoring offerings, and sold our test and measurement business to SPX Corporation - both after quarter-end. Optical Technologies In the Optical Technologies sector, revenues were $52 million for the third quarter of 2003, versus $65 million in 2002. While continued weakness in scientific and industrial end-markets resulted in a 21 percent decline in organic revenues year-to-year, sequentially, revenues were flat. GAAP operating margin was negative 10.3 percent for the 2003 period, versus 0.4 percent in 2002, primarily due to the writedown of our molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) product line, which we sold to Oxford Instruments plc just after quarter-end. The sector reported adjusted operating margin of 1.2 percent in 2003, compared with negative 0.6 percent last year, reflecting the positive impact of restructuring efforts and continued productivity improvements. During the quarter, we
announced a strategic alliance with German photonics leader Jenoptik AG to develop and market thin-disk lasers, a key technology platform for the future. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin, which exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, and benefit from tax credit carryforwards. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We believe that the inclusion of such non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. Specifically: o We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, in connection with the final phase of our overall reorganization, which we expect will be substantially complete in 2004. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs. o We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of 5 to 10 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time. o We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, as well as benefit from tax credit carryforwards, that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, such as those arising from the sale of a business or real estate, the sale of our remaining equity interests in Thoratec and FLIR Systems, and the early retirement of debt, which we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. Thermo's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo's results of operations included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo's results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables. Thermo's earnings guidance, however, is only provided on an adjusted basis. It
is not feasible to provide GAAP EPS guidance because the items excluded, other than the amortization expense, are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, such as decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations, and the timing of and proceeds from the sale of our remaining equity interest in Thoratec. We no longer own any shares of FLIR Systems. Conference Call Thermo Electron will hold its earnings conference call on Wednesday, October 22, 2003, at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
