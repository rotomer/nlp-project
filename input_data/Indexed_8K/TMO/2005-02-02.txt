[THERMO LOGO] Exhibit 99.1 News FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Contact Information: Investor Contact Information: Lori Gorski J. Timothy Corcoran Phone: 781-622-1242 Phone: 781-622-1111 E-mail: lori.gorski@thermo.com E-mail: tim.corcoran@thermo.com Website: www.thermo.com Thermo Electron Reports 16% Revenue Growth and Record Operating Income in the Fourth Quarter WALTHAM, Mass. (February 2, 2005) - Thermo Electron Corporation (NYSE:TMO) today reported fourth quarter 2004 revenues of $613 million, a 16 percent increase from $529 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased to $.74 in the 2004 quarter, compared with $.37 in the year-ago period, primarily due to tax benefits that were recorded following the completion of prior-year tax audits, as well as improved operating performance. GAAP operating income for the quarter rose 25 percent, and GAAP operating margin increased to 10.8 percent from 10.0 percent in 2003. Adjusted EPS grew 15 percent to $.38 in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $.33 in the 2003 period. Adjusted operating income increased 7 percent to record fourth quarter levels since the company's reorganization in 2000. Adjusted operating margin in the 2004 quarter was 13.1 percent, versus 14.2 percent in 2003. The margin in 2004 was reduced by 1.1 percent due to up-front costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and the initial dilutive effect of acquisitions. Organic revenues, which exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, grew 3 percent in the quarter. Currency translation increased revenues by 5 percent, and the net effect of acquisitions/divestitures led to an 8 percent increase for the quarter. For the full year, Thermo Electron reported a revenue increase of 16 percent in 2004 to $2.2 billion, up from $1.9 billion in 2003. GAAP diluted EPS in 2004 rose to $2.17, versus $1.20 a year ago, principally driven by tax benefits, large gains from the sale of discontinued operations, and improved operating performance. GAAP operating income grew 27 percent over 2003, and GAAP operating margin for the year increased to 10.8 percent, versus 9.9 percent in 2003. Full-year adjusted EPS grew 15 percent to $1.25 in 2004, compared with $1.09 in 2003. Adjusted operating income was up 16 percent year to year, and adjusted operating margin was 12.7 percent. Organic revenues grew 4 percent. Currency translation increased revenues by 5 percent, and the net effect of acquisitions/divestitures increased revenues by 7 percent for the year. Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and organic revenues are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed at the end of this press release under the heading, "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
Year-End Highlights o Adjusted EPS grew 15 percent o Reported revenues rose 16 percent o Organic revenues increased 4 percent o Cash flow from continuing operations rose 20 percent to $240 million o Manufacturing centers opened in China and Germany o Agreement announced in January 2005 to acquire Kendro Laboratory Products "We're pleased to have achieved $.38 in adjusted EPS for the quarter, which is at the high end of our earnings guidance," said Marijn E. Dekkers, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Electron. "We also had an excellent year overall, with a 16 percent increase in revenues, 15 percent growth in adjusted EPS and strong cash flow. Our full-year adjusted EPS of $1.25 was also at the top of our guidance range, which we raised for continuing operations after the sale of Spectra-Physics. "We made great strides during 2004 in changing our business mix to better serve our laboratory customers and reinforce our position as the world leader in analytical instruments. We sold Spectra-Physics, our only non-Thermo brand. We made a number of strategic acquisitions - Jouan, USCS, InnaPhase, and the recently announced agreement to acquire Kendro - to augment our offerings of laboratory equipment, software and services. And, we continue to make significant internal investments that allow us to strengthen our competitive position worldwide, such as new state-of-the-art manufacturing centers we recently opened in Shanghai, China, and Bremen, Germany. "With a clear business focus, the ability to reinvest for growth and continuous efforts to improve productivity, we remain optimistic and expect to begin 2005 with strength. Our goal is to report $.29 to $.31 in adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2005, versus $.27 in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we are providing guidance of $1.40 to $1.45." (This guidance excludes approximately $.03 of expense per quarter from the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; results from the pending Kendro acquisition; the effect of new accounting rules relating to the expensing of stock options, which we expect to adopt in the third quarter of 2005; and the other items described in this press release under the heading, "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.") Life and Laboratory Sciences The Life and Laboratory Sciences segment reported a 21 percent revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $455 million, versus $377 million in 2003. Organic revenues grew 3 percent. The effects of currency translation and acquisitions increased revenues by 5 percent and 13 percent, respectively. We reported strong sales of mass spectrometry and molecular spectroscopy instruments, laboratory automation systems and laboratory informatics, where we have greatly extended our pharmaceutical offerings through the addition of InnaPhase. Partially offsetting these increases, we reported extremely weak sales of our rapid point-of-care test kits resulting from this year's light flu season compared with an exceptionally strong quarter in 2003. GAAP operating income for the segment grew 24 percent in the 2004 quarter, with GAAP operating margin increasing to 15.3 percent from 14.9 percent a year ago. Adjusted operating income increased 19 percent in the 2004 quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 17.8 percent, compared with 18.1 percent in the 2003 quarter. The adjusted operating margin improved by 50 basis points in 2004 before the effect of acquisitions, which lowered the margin by 80 basis points. As we continue to integrate these operations, we expect margins to improve in future quarters. Measurement and Control Fourth quarter revenues in the Measurement and Control segment were $158 million, up 4 percent compared with $152 million last year. Organic revenues grew slightly, at 1 percent, due to a difficult year-to-year comparison resulting from large shipments of our food-quality and security instruments in the 2003 quarter. The effect of currency translation increased revenues by 4 percent, while the net effect of acquisitions/divestitures decreased revenues by 1 percent.
GAAP operating income for the segment increased 29 percent from the 2003 quarter, and GAAP operating margin rose to 7.7 percent, versus 6.2 percent last year. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin for the segment were virtually flat compared with 2003. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income also exclude certain other gains and losses, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards and the impact of the resolution of significant tax audits. In addition, our adjusted EPS guidance excludes results of pending acquisitions and the impact of accounting principles not yet adopted, such as stock option expensing. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We also use the concept of organic revenue growth, which excludes the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures. We believe that the inclusion of such measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. Specifically: We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, in connection with the final phase of our overall reorganization, which we substantially completed in 2004. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs. We exclude charges relating to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, as we believe these charges are not indicative of our normal operating costs. We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of 5 to 10 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, benefits from tax credit carryforwards and the impact of the resolution of significant tax audits that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability and which we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. We exclude gains/losses from the sale of our equity interests in Newport Corporation, Thoratec Corporation and FLIR Systems, Inc., as well as other items such as the sale of a business or real estate and the early retirement of debt. Thermo's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo's results of operations included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo's results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables and/or the text of this press release. Thermo's earnings guidance, however, is only provided on an adjusted basis. It is not feasible to provide GAAP EPS guidance because the items excluded, other than the amortization expense, are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, such as the timing of completion of and results from pending acquisitions, the impact of accounting principles not yet adopted (such as stock option
expensing), decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations and the timing of and proceeds from the sale of our equity interests in Newport and Thoratec. We no longer own any shares of FLIR Systems. Conference Call Thermo Electron will hold its earnings conference call on Thursday, February 3, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.
