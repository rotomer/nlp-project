Under the Credit Agreement, the Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the obligations under the Credit Agreement of Thermo Luxembourg, Thermo Finance B.V., and any European subsidiary of the Company that becomes a borrower under the Credit Agreement (each, an "additional Borrower"). The obligations of Thermo Luxembourg, Thermo Finance B.V., and any additional Borrower under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to such matters as ERISA, uninsured judgments and the failure to pay certain indebtedness, and a change of control default. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on standby and performance letters of credit, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, liens, fundamental changes, dispositions of property and investments. The financial covenants include interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios of the Company.

Any Borrower may borrow Loans in Euros and Alternate Currencies during the Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided that the relevant Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., London time, three Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the requested Borrowing Date, (ii) the respective
18 amounts of each Loan in each currency and (iii) the respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor.

Accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date. (b) Thermo Luxembourg agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts and on the dates as set forth in the Fee Letter, dated as of June 2, 2005, between Thermo Luxembourg and the Administrative Agent, and in any other fee agreements between Thermo Luxembourg and the Administrative executed after the date of this Agreement, and to perform any other obligations contained therein. 2.4 Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. Thermo Luxembourg shall have the right upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Commitments; provided that no such termination or reduction of Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans, the Total Loans would exceed the Total Commitments. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to (euro)10,000,000, or an integral multiple of (euro)1,000,000 in excess thereof, and shall reduce permanently the Commitments then in effect. 2.5 Optional Prepayments. Any Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 A.M., London time, three Business Days prior to the date of prepayment, which notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and, if such prepayment is of Alternate
19 Currency Loans, the applicable Alternate Currency; provided, that if a Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the relevant Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in the principal amount of (w) (euro)5,000,000 or a whole multiple of (euro)1,000,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Euro Loans, (x) (pound)5,000,000 or a whole multiple of (pound)500,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Sterling Loans, (y) $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Dollar Loans, and (z) an amount of which the Euro Equivalent shall be approximately (euro)5,000,000 or a whole multiple of (euro)1,000,000 in excess thereof, in the case of other Alternate Currency Loans. 2.6 Mandatory Prepayments. If, on any date, the Total Loans outstanding on such date exceed 102% of the Total Commitments in effect on such date, the Borrowers shall, without notice or demand, promptly (but in any event, within three Business Days of such date) prepay such outstanding Loans in an aggregate principal amount such that, after giving effect thereto, the Total Loans do not exceed the Total Commitments. Any amounts prepaid pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal so prepaid and any amounts payable under Section 2.16 in connection therewith. 2.7 Continuation Options. Any Loan denominated in any currency may be continued in such currency upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the relevant Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, provided that if the relevant Borrower shall fail to give any required notice of continuation of a Loan, such Loan shall be automatically continued in such currency for an Interest Period of one month. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof. 2.8 Limitations on Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings and continuations of Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that no more than ten Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 2.9 Repayment of Loans. Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to each Lender on the Termination Date (or such earlier date as the Loans become due and payable pursuant to Section 7), the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to such Borrower by such Lender. Each Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest in immediately available funds at the office of the Administrative Agent on the unpaid principal amount of such Loans from time to time from the date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates per annum, and on the dates, set forth in Section 2.10.
20 2.10 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to (i) the LIBOR Rate determined for such day plus (ii) the Margin plus (iii) any Mandatory Cost incurred by such Lender in respect of such Loans from time to time. (b) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section plus 2% and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or any commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the highest rate then applicable under this Agreement to Loans denominated in the currency in which such amount is payable hereunder plus 2%, in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (before as well as after judgment). (c) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand. 2.11 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Sterling Loans, interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year for actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the relevant Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Margin shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the relevant Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the relevant Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of any Borrower, deliver to such Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.10(a). 2.12 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for Loans in Euros or one or more Alternate Currencies for such Interest Period, (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for Loans in Euros or one or more Alternate Currencies for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the
21 Required Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, or (c) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that deposits in the applicable currency are not generally available, or cannot be obtained by the Lenders, in the applicable market (any currency affected by the circumstances described in clause (a), (b) or (c) is referred to as an "Affected Currency"), then the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, then (i) any such Loans in an Affected Currency requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall not be made, (ii) any outstanding Loans in an Affected Currency shall be due and payable on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, and (iii) until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Loans in an Affected Currency shall be made or continued as such. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than three Business Days after the giving of the required notice by the Administrative Agent with respect to such circumstances, the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Lenders) shall negotiate with the Borrowers in good faith in order to ascertain whether a substitute interest rate (a "Substitute Rate") may be agreed upon for the maintaining of Loans in the Affected Currency. If a Substitute Rate is agreed upon by the Borrowers and all the Lenders, such Substitute Rate shall apply. If a Substitute Rate is not so agreed upon by the Borrowers and all the Lenders within such time, each Lender's Loans in the Affected Currency shall thereafter bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the rate certified by such Lender to be its costs of funds (from such sources as it may reasonably select out of those sources then available to it) for such Loans, plus (ii) the Margin plus (iii), any Mandatory Cost incurred by such Lender in respect of such Loans from time to time. 2.13 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing by any Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by any Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Loan Percentages of the Lenders. (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by the Lenders. (c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, London time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at its Funding Office, in immediately available funds. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, amounts owing hereunder on account of principal and interest on Loans shall be paid in the currency in which such Loan was borrowed, and amounts owing hereunder on account of fees shall be paid in Euros. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment on a Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in
22 which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be the sum of (x) the cost to it of funding such amount plus (y) the Margin, on demand, from the relevant Borrower. The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such other Lender's share of such borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of any Borrower against any Lender that has failed or refused to make available such Lender's share of any borrowing. (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by such Borrower hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the relevant Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at a rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the relevant Borrower with respect to such payment. 2.14 Requirements of Law. (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made, in each case, subsequent to the date hereof: (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of
23 payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.15 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender); (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate; or (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition relating to funding of assets that would include the Loans or the income or earnings in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.15 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender); and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender reasonably deems to be material, of making, continuing or maintaining Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the relevant Borrower shall, promptly after its receipt of a notice with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.14(d), pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. (b) If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof by a Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made, in each case, subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after such Lender has provided written notice in accordance with Section 2.14(d) to the relevant Borrower requesting compensation for such reduction under this paragraph, the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction. (c) If any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction from which Euros or any Alternate Currency is issued (or any other jurisdiction in which the funding operations of any Lender shall be conducted with respect to such currency) shall have in effect any reserve, liquid asset or similar requirement with respect to any category of deposits or liabilities customarily used to fund loans in such currency, or by reference to which interest rates applicable to loans in such currency are determined (other than any such requirement included in the computation of Mandatory Cost), and the result of such requirement shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan in such currency, and such Lender shall deliver to the relevant Borrower a written notice in accordance with Section 2.14(d) requesting compensation for such additional cost under this paragraph, then the relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender
24 on each Interest Payment Date with respect to each affected Loan an amount that will compensate such Lender for such additional cost. (d) If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts, compensation or additional costs pursuant to this Section, it shall deliver a written notice in accordance with this paragraph to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) requesting such additional amounts, compensation or additional costs and notifying the relevant Borrower of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. Such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to deliver such notice promptly following the time at which it becomes aware of the event giving rise to such additional amounts, compensation or additional cost payable (provided that, except as provided below in this paragraph, the failure by such Lender to give such notice promptly shall not adversely affect any of its rights hereunder). A certificate as to any additional amounts, compensation or additional costs payable to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 submitted by any Lender to any Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to such paragraphs for any amounts incurred more than three months prior to the date that such Lender notifies such Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; and provided further that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such three-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of each Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (x) the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof by a Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not, in each case, having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Alternate Currency Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Alternate Currency Loan, or (y) there shall have occurred any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions (including the imposition of or any change in exchange controls, but excluding conditions otherwise covered by this Section 2.14) which would make it impracticable for any Lender to make or maintain Loans denominated in the relevant Alternate Currency after the date hereof to, or for the account of, any Borrower, then, by written notice to each Borrower and to the Administrative Agent: (i) such Lender may declare that Loans (in the affected Alternate Currency or Currencies) will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness or change in conditions) be made by such Lender or Lenders hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods), whereupon any request for a Loan (in the affected Alternate Currency or Currencies) or to continue a Loan (in the affected Alternate Currency or Currencies), as the case may be, for an additional Interest Period shall, as to such Lender only, be of no force and effect, unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
25 (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Loans (in the affected Alternate Currency or Currencies), made by it be converted to Euro Loans (unless repaid by the relevant Borrower), in which event all such Loans (in the affected Alternate Currency or Currencies) shall be converted to Euro Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (f) below and at the Exchange Rate on the date of such conversion or, at the option of the relevant Borrower, repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal made thereafter that would otherwise have been applied to repay the converted Alternate Currency Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Euro Loans made by such Lender resulting from such conversion. (f) For purposes of Section 2.14(e), a notice to any Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Alternate Currency Loan made to such Borrower by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Alternate Currency Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the relevant Borrower. 2.15 Taxes. (a) All payments made by any Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement, provided, however, that no Borrower shall be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this Section or (ii) that are taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the relevant Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph. (b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
26 (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by any Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the relevant Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by such Borrower showing payment thereof. If the relevant Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. (d) Each Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Lender is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall, at the reasonable request of the Borrowers, deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at such time or times prescribed by applicable law and such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (e) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.16 Indemnity. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making a borrowing of or continuation of Loans after such Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by such Borrower in making any prepayment of Loans after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank LIBOR market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the relevant Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.17 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.14 or 2.15(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the relevant Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such
27 designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal, regulatory or other disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.15(a). 2.18 Replacement of Lenders. The Borrowers shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.15(a) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder, with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.17 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.15(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par (unless the Lender being replaced otherwise agrees to accept a lesser payment in its discretion), all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the relevant Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.16 if any Loan owing by such Borrower to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall (A) be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (B) deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire, (vii) (A) in the event of a replacement of a Lender pursuant to clause (a) above, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 in accordance with Section 10.6 or (B) in the event of a replacement of a Lender pursuant to clause (b) above, the replaced Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 in accordance with Section 10.6, (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, each Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required to be paid by such Borrower pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.15(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. In the event of a replacement of a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18, such replaced Lender and the replacement financial institution shall promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers an Assignment and Assumption, and shall comply with the provisions of Section 10.6(b)(iii), (iv) and (v) (other than the requirements included in such clause (v) with respect to the delivery of consents and the processing and recordation fee, which are covered above in this Section). 2.19 Judgment Currency. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction, the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given. (b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "Applicable Creditor") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum
28 adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the relevant Borrower as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of each Borrower contained in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder. SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans, Thermo Electron hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as of the date of this Agreement (except as to the representations and warranties made as of a date certain, which shall be true and correct as of such date) and as of the date such representations and warranties are deemed to be made under Section 4.2(a), that: 3.1 Financial Condition. The audited consolidated balance sheets of Thermo Electron and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 28, 2002, December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of Thermo Electron and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Thermo Electron and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at April 2, 2005, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-month period ended on such date, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of Thermo Electron and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the three-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject to the absence of footnotes with respect to unaudited quarterly statements) applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein). As of the date of this Agreement, no Group Member has any material Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, other than those that (i) are not material to Thermo Electron and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) are reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph or in Thermo Electron's most recent report on Form 10-K or any subsequent reports on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (such filings made prior to the date of this Agreement, the "SEC Filings"). During the period from December 31, 2004 to and including the date of this Agreement there has been no Disposition by any Group Member of any part of its business or property material to Thermo Electron and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in the most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph or in Thermo Electron's SEC Filings.
29 3.2 No Change. Since December 31, 2004, there has been no development or event that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, except that no representation and warranty is made in this Section 3.2 with respect to the Current Litigation. 3.3 Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Group Member (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to conform to the requirements of clauses (a) through (d) could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 3.4 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. Thermo Electron and each Borrower has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of each Borrower, to borrow hereunder. Thermo Electron and each Borrower have taken all necessary organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of each Borrower, to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with (other than any SEC filing by Thermo Electron in compliance with the SEC disclosure obligations), notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required of any Group Member in connection with the borrowings by any Borrower hereunder or with the execution, delivery and performance by Thermo Electron or any Borrower, or the validity or enforceability against Thermo Electron or any Borrower, of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of Thermo Electron and each Borrower. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Thermo Electron and each Borrower, as applicable, enforceable against Thermo Electron or such Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law). 3.5 No Legal Bar. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation. 3.6 Litigation. It is not probable that the Current Litigation will have a Material Adverse Effect, and no other litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of Thermo Electron,
30 threatened by or against any Group Member or against any of their respective properties or revenues that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 3.7 Ownership of Property; Liens. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Group Member has title in fee simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property, and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its other property, and none of such property is subject to any Lien except as permitted by Section 6.4. 3.8 Taxes. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Group Member has filed or caused to be filed all material tax returns that are required to be filed by each of them in each applicable jurisdiction and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the relevant Group Member). 3.9 Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loans will be used for any purpose that violates the provisions of Regulation U or any of the other Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent, each Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U. 3.10 ERISA. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount that is material in relation to Consolidated Net Worth. Except as in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither Thermo Electron nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, and neither Thermo Electron nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any liability under ERISA that, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect if Thermo Electron or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent under circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
31 3.11 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. Neither Thermo Electron nor any Borrower is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither Thermo Electron nor any Borrower is subject to regulation under any Requirement of Law (other than Regulation X of the Board) that limits its ability to incur Indebtedness. 3.12 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used by the Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries for working capital, acquisitions, repurchases of Capital Stock, debentures and other securities of the Borrowers, the refinancing of present and future debt and general corporate purposes. 3.13 Environmental Matters. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) the facilities and properties owned, leased or operated by any Group Member (the "Properties") do not contain, and have not previously contained, any Materials of Environmental Concern in amounts or concentrations or under circumstances that constitute or constituted a violation of, or could give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law; (b) no Group Member has received or is aware of any notice of violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or potential liability regarding environmental matters or compliance with Environmental Laws with regard to any of the Properties or the business operated by any Group Member (the "Business"), nor does Thermo Electron have knowledge or reason to believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened; (c) Materials of Environmental Concern have not been transported or disposed of from the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location that could give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law, nor have any Materials of Environmental Concern been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or under any of the Properties in violation of, or in a manner that could give rise to liability under, any applicable Environmental Law; (d) no judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative action is pending or, to the knowledge of Thermo Electron, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which any Group Member is or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties or the Business, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the Business; (e) there has been no release or threat of release of Materials of Environmental Concern at or from the Properties, or arising from or related to the operations of any Group Member in connection with the Properties or otherwise in connection with the Business, in violation of or in amounts or in a manner that could give rise to liability under Environmental Laws; (f) the Properties and all operations at the Properties are in compliance, and have in the last five years been in compliance, with all applicable Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about the Properties or violation of any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the Business; and
32 (g) no Group Member has assumed any liability of any other Person under Environmental Laws. 3.14 Accuracy of Information, etc. No statement or information contained in this Agreement, the Confidential Information Package or any other document, certificate or statement furnished by or on behalf of Thermo Electron or any Borrower to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, for use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, contained as of the date such statement, information, document or certificate was so furnished (or, in the case of the Confidential Information Package, as of the date of this Agreement) when taken together with the SEC Filings, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading. The projections and pro forma financial information contained in the materials referenced above are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by management of Thermo Electron and the Borrowers to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such financial information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial information may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount. 3.15 Dutch Banking Act(a) . (a) Thermo Finance B.V. is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Banking Act; (b) on the date of this Agreement Thermo Finance B.V. has verified the status of each Lender as a Professional Market Party; and (c) on the date of any assignment by a Lender to an Assignee pursuant to Section 10.6 Thermo Finance B.V. will have verified the status of such Assignee as a Professional Market Party. SECTION 4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 4.1 Conditions to Initial Loans. The agreement of each Lender to make the initial Loans requested to be made by it is subject to the satisfaction, prior to or concurrently with the making of such Loans, of the following conditions precedent: (a) Credit Agreement.

Except as expressly provided above in this Section, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived by Thermo Electron and the Borrowers. SECTION 8. THE AGENTS 8.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. 8.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or
46 attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. 8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable to any Lender for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party. 8.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Thermo Electron and the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans. 8.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender, Thermo Electron or a Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
47 shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. 8.6 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates. 8.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), ratably according to their respective Loan Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Loan Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
48 Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 8.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity. 8.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders and Thermo Electron. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 7(a) or Section 7(f) with respect to Thermo Electron or any Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by Thermo Electron (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 8.10 Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents. Neither the Syndication Agent nor any Co-Documentation Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such. SECTION 9. THERMO ELECTRON GUARANTEE 9.1 Guarantee. (a) To induce the Lenders to execute and deliver this Agreement and to make the Loans, and in consideration thereof, Thermo Electron hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and their respective successors, indorsees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations, and Thermo Electron further agrees to pay the expenses which may be paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in collecting any or all of the Obligations and/or enforcing any rights under this Section 9.1.
49 (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of Thermo Electron hereunder shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by Thermo Electron under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors. (c) The guarantee contained in this Section 9 shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon Thermo Electron and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders and their successors and permitted assigns, until all the Obligations and the obligations of Thermo Electron under the guarantee contained in this Section 9 shall have been satisfied by payment in full and the Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement the Borrowers may be free from any Obligations. 9.2 No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by Thermo Electron hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of Thermo Electron by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, Thermo Electron shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Borrower or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall Thermo Electron seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from any Borrower in respect of payments made by Thermo Electron hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by any Borrower on account of the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to Thermo Electron on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by Thermo Electron in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall, forthwith upon receipt by Thermo Electron, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by Thermo Electron (duly indorsed by Thermo Electron to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. 9.3 Amendments, etc. with respect to the Obligations. Thermo Electron shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against Thermo Electron and without notice to or further assent by Thermo Electron, any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and this Agreement and the Notes and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this Section 9 or any property subject thereto.
50 9.4 Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Thermo Electron waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the guarantee contained in this Section 9 or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Section 9; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Section 9; and all dealings between the Borrowers and Thermo Electron, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Section 9. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Thermo Electron waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon any Borrower or Thermo Electron with respect to the Obligations. Thermo Electron understands and agrees that the guarantee contained in this Section 9 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any Note, any of the Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrowers or Thermo Electron) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrowers for the Obligations, or of Thermo Electron under the guarantee contained in this Section 9, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against Thermo Electron the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against any Borrower, or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrowers, or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any Borrower, or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve Thermo Electron of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against Thermo Electron. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings. 9.5 Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Section 9 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Borrower or Thermo Electron, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Borrower or Thermo Electron or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
51 9.6 Payments. Thermo Electron hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim in the applicable currency at the Funding Office. 9.7 Independent Obligations. The obligations of Thermo Electron under the guarantee contained in this Section 9 are independent of the obligations of the Borrowers, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Thermo Electron whether or not any Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. Thermo Electron waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS 10.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.1. The Required Lenders, the Borrowers and Thermo Electron may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers and Thermo Electron may, from time to time, (a) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders, Thermo Electron or the Borrowers hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount or extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan, reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except in connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates (which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Required Lenders)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Lender under this Section 10.1 without the written consent of such Lender; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders or consent to the assignment or transfer by Thermo Electron or any Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in each case without the written consent of all Lenders; (iv) change Section 2.13 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender; (v) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 8 without the written consent of the Administrative Agent; or (vi) add additional currencies as Alternate Currencies in which Alternate Currency Loans may be made under this Agreement without the written consent of all the Lenders. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon Thermo Electron, the Borrowers, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans. In the case of any waiver, Thermo Electron, the Borrowers, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be
52 cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 10.2 Notices.

The Borrowers jointly and severally agree (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent, with statements with respect to the foregoing to be submitted to the Borrowers prior to the Closing Date (in the case of amounts to be paid on the Closing Date) and from time to time thereafter on a quarterly basis or such other periodic basis as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate, (b) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including the fees and disbursements of counsel to each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent and (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent and their respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents and controlling persons (each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) with respect to such Lender or Administrative Agent being a party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the enforcement or performance of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including any of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of any Group Member or any of the Properties (all the foregoing in this clause (c), collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), provided, that no Borrower shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or the breach by such Indemnitee of its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee.

The agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
55 10.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) neither Thermo Electron nor any Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by Thermo Electron or any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an "Assignee") all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld (it being agreed that it will not be unreasonable for Thermo Electron to withhold its consent on the basis that it is unable to determine whether or not the proposed Assignee is a Professional Market Party if it shall not have been provided with information regarding the proposed Assignee that is adequate to form the basis for such determination)) of: (A) Thermo Electron, provided that no consent of Thermo Electron shall be required for an assignment to an existing Lender, or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Person; and (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment. (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to an existing Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitments or Loans, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than (euro)5,000,000 unless each of Thermo Electron and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that (1) no such consent of Thermo Electron shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred -------- and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any; (B) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Thermo Electron, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, and at such time deliver to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
56 (C) the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire; and (D) to the extent applicable, the provisions of Section 10.6(g). For the purposes of this Section 10.6, the term "Approved Fund" has the following meaning: "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender. (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Thermo Electron, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
57 (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of Thermo Electron, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) Thermo Electron, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, Thermo Electron and each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant shall be subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Thermo Electron's prior written consent. No Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless such Participant provides such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to withholding tax matters as required under Section 2.15(d). (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (e) Each Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above. (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender may assign its rights and obligations to a Conduit Lender organized and administered by such Lender, provided that such assignment shall be subject to all the requirements of the definition of the term "Conduit Lender" in Section 1.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the consent of Thermo Electron or the Administrative Agent and without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 10.6(b). Each of the Administrative Agent, Thermo Electron, each Borrower and each Lender hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in
58 instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance. (g) If, on the date of any proposed assignment, it is a requirement of Dutch law that each Lender to a Dutch Borrower must be a Professional Market Party: (i) any Lender which proposes to assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Assignee shall give Thermo Finance B.V. and Thermo Electron at least four Business Days' prior written notice thereof, and such assignment shall, subject to satisfaction of all the applicable requirements of this Section 10.6, become effective (A) if Thermo Electron shall have consented thereto pursuant to Section 10.6(b)(i)(A) or (B) if, pursuant to the proviso to Section 10.6(b)(i)(A), the consent of Thermo Electron to the proposed assignment is not required, as of the close of business in London on the fourth Business Day after receipt by Thermo Finance B.V. and Thermo Electron of such notice unless, on or prior to such time on such fourth Business Day, Thermo Finance B.V. shall have demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent that either (x) the proposed Assignee is not a Professional Market Party or (y) Thermo Finance B.V., acting in good faith, has been unable to determine (including on the basis of information delivered to Thermo Finance B.V. and Thermo Electron together with such notice) whether the proposed Assignee is a Professional Market Party (it being understood that, if Thermo Finance B.V. shall have so demonstrated to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such time on such fourth Business Day, such assignment shall not become effective); (ii) no assignment will be effective unless both the Assignee and Thermo Finance B.V. have complied with the requirements of this Section 10.6(g); (iii) on the date the assignment becomes effective the Assignee must make the representation on the terms set out in clause 3(b) of the Assignment and Assumption; (iv) on the date that an Assignee becomes party to this Agreement as a Lender, Thermo Finance B.V. must represent pursuant to Section 3.15(c) that on that date it has verified the status of such Assignee as a Professional Market Party. 10.7 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender, if any Lender (a "Benefited Lender") shall receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 7(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating
59 interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, without prior notice to Thermo Electron or any Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by Thermo Electron and each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by Thermo Electron or any Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of Thermo Electron or the relevant Borrower, as the case may be. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Thermo Electron or the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. (c) By joining in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby waive (doet afstand van), with respect to any Dutch bank account maintained by Thermo Electron or any Borrower, any right of pledge over any balance standing to credit of such Dutch bank account which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have or at any time in the future may acquire under its general banking conditions or otherwise, under the general terms and conditions (algemene voorwaarden) of any member of the Dutch Bankers' Association (Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken) or any similar term applied by a financial institution in the Netherlands pursuant to its general terms and conditions; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph (c) shall be deemed to limit in any way the rights of any Lender under paragraph (b) above. 10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with Thermo Electron and the Administrative Agent. 10.9 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of Thermo Electron, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by Thermo Electron, any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents. 10.11 GOVERNING LAW.
