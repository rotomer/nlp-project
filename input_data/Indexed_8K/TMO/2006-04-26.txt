WALTHAM, Mass., April 26, 2006 - Thermo Electron Corporation (NYSE: TMO) today reported revenue growth of 22% to $684 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $559 million in the 2005 quarter. Acquisitions (net of divestitures) increased revenues by 16%, and unfavorable currency translation reduced revenues by 4%. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $.28 in the 2006 quarter, compared with $.30 in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings in the 2006 quarter reflect a $.02 impact from stock option expense for rules that became effective in 2006 and $.07 of increased amortization expense due to acquisitions. GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2006 rose 14%, and GAAP operating margin for the period was 9.9%, versus 10.7% a year ago.
 
Adjusted EPS grew 34% to $.39 in the first quarter of 2006 (including $.02 of stock option expense), compared with $.29 in 2005 on a pro forma basis as if stock option expense had been recorded in that quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 58% in the 2006 quarter, and adjusted operating margin rose 320 basis points to 14.2%, from 11.0% in 2005 on a pro forma basis including stock option expense.
 
Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
First Quarter Highlights
 
 
Were off to an excellent start in 2006, continuing our trend of strong growth in revenues and adjusted EPS, as well as significant expansion of our adjusted operating margin, said Marijn E. Dekkers, Thermo Electron president and chief executive officer. The aggressive investments weve made to expand our breadth of technologies and services are enabling us to offer more complete solutions to the challenges our customers face in a variety of industries. This provides us with greater pricing opportunities at a time when our major end markets are strong.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In life sciences, our expanding range of integrated laboratory technologies - from sample preparation and analysis to data interpretation - is helping to redefine research for our customers and is leading to accelerated growth in this part of our business. The unmatched strength and breadth of our laboratory capabilities was evident at last months PITTCON
exhibition, where we introduced a host of important new products to strengthen our portfolio of solutions and reinforce our position as the world leader in analytical instruments. In industrial markets, where growth remains strong, demand for our comprehensive offering of environmental monitoring technologies is increasing as our customers prepare to meet strict new regulations around the world.
 
Based on our solid first quarter performance and the strength in our markets, we are raising our 2006 guidance. For the full year, we now expect to achieve adjusted EPS of $1.68 to $1.73 (including $.10 per share of stock option expense), leading to a 14 to 18% increase over our pro forma 2005 results including stock option expense. We expect to report revenues in the range of $2.81 to $2.86 billion in 2006, for a 7 to 9% increase over last year, reflecting a more optimistic view of our growth potential and slightly more favorable currency translation.
 
In the following segment information, results identified as adjusted exclude stock option expense and other items described below under Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
Life and Laboratory Sciences
 
The Life and Laboratory Sciences segment reported that revenues grew 30% in the first quarter of 2006 to $512 million, compared with $393 million in 2005. GAAP operating income for the segment increased 10% in the quarter, and GAAP operating margin was 11.1%, versus 13.2% in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating income rose 52% in the 2006 quarter, and adjusted operating margin increased to 16.8%, compared with 14.4% in 2005.
 
Measurement and Control
 
Revenues in the Measurement and Control segment increased 4% to $172 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $166 million in the 2005 quarter. GAAP operating income for the segment rose 18% in the 2006 period, and GAAP operating margin was 12.7%, compared with 11.1% a year ago. Adjusted operating income grew 21% in the 2006 quarter, and adjusted operating margin increased to 14.2%, from 12.2% in 2005.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards, the impact of significant tax audits or events and discontinued operations. We exclude the above items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. Stock option expense has been excluded from adjusted segment results because management does not utilize that component of cost in evaluating the performance of the segments. For purposes of comparison, 2005 consolidated adjusted results reflect the pro forma effect of stock option expense as if it had been required in that period. We believe that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the companys performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For example:
 
We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities in connection with our Kendro acquisition. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.
 
We exclude charges and tax effects related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, as we believe these charges are not indicative of our normal operating costs.
 
We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of 5 to 10 years. Our adjusted EPS estimate for 2006 excludes approximately $.40 of expense for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for acquisitions completed to date. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.
 
We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, benefits from tax credit carryforwards and the impact of significant tax audits or events, which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability and that we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. We exclude gains/losses from the sale of our equity interests in Newport Corporation and Thoratec Corporation, as well as other items such as the sale of a business or real estate, the early retirement of debt and discontinued operations. (We sold our remaining shares of Newport and Thoratec during the second quarter of 2005.)
 
Thermos management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the companys core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermos results of operations included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermos results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables. Thermos earnings guidance, however, is only provided on an adjusted basis. It is not feasible to provide GAAP EPS guidance because the items excluded, other than the amortization expense, are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, such as the impact of accounting principles not yet adopted and decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations.
