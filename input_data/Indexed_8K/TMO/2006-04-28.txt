Item 2.05 Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities
On April 26, 2006, Thermo Electron Corporation (the Company) announced its decision to discontinue all manufacturing and distribution operations at its Milford, Massachusetts facility.  The facility is part of the Companys Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and the operations consist of a service depot, distribution activities and the manufacture of four product lines - centrifuges, molecular biology products, vacuum concentrators and power supplies. The service depot and distribution activities will be relocated to the Companys facility in Asheville, North Carolina, which was acquired as a result of the Kendro acquisition in May 2005.  All of the product lines, with the exception of the power supply line, are being relocated to other facilities of the Company.  Manufacture of power supplies will be outsourced to an unrelated third party.
As a result of the plant closing, approximately 100 employees will be severed.  Restructuring and related charges associated with the plant closing are expected to be approximately $8 million, which will be incurred primarily in the second and third quarters of 2006.  Of these charges, approximately $5.5 million represent cash costs, including $2.3 million of severance and related personnel costs and $3.2 million of abandoned facility costs.  In addition, the Company expects to incur $2.5 million of asset write-offs.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized, on this 28
th
day of April, 2006.
