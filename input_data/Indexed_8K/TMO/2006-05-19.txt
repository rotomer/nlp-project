Item 1.01 Entry into or Amendment of Material Definitive Agreement
On February 28, 2006, as previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2006, the Board of Directors of Thermo Electron Corporation (the Company), voted to approve a new compensation arrangement for Directors that included an increase in the annual stock option grant to eligible Directors from 7,500 shares to 10,500 shares. The implementation of an amendment to the Companys Directors Stock Option Plan (as so amended and restated, the Plan), effecting the increase in the annual stock option grant to eligible Directors was approved by the Board of Directors on May 18, 2006 and is reflected in the Plan which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized, on this 19
th
day of May, 2006.

Exhibit 10.1
The purpose of this Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") of Thermo Electron Corporation (the "Company") is to encourage ownership in the Company by outside directors of the Company whose services are considered essential to the Company's growth and progress and to provide them with a further incentive to become directors and to continue as directors of the Company. The Plan is intended to be a nonstatutory stock option plan.
The Board of Directors (the Board), or a Committee (the "Committee") consisting of one or more directors of the Company appointed by the Board, shall supervise and administer the Plan. Grants of stock options under the Plan and the amount and nature of the options to be granted shall be automatic in accordance with Section 5. However, all questions of interpretation of the Plan or of any stock options granted under it shall be determined by the Board or the Committee and such determination shall be final and binding upon all persons having an interest in the Plan.
Directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company or any subsidiary or parent of the Company shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Directors who receive grants of stock options in accordance with this Plan are sometimes referred to herein as "Optionees."
The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan shall be 773,330 shares of the Company's
 
Common Stock (the "Common Stock"), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 9. Shares to be issued upon the exercise of options granted under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares or shares held by the Company in its treasury. If any option expires or terminates for any reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject thereto shall again be available for options thereafter to be granted.
Each Director of the Company who meets the requirements of Section 3 and who is holding office immediately following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders commencing with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in calendar year
 
1993,
 
shall be granted an option to
purchase shares of Common Stock at the close of business on the date of such Annual Meeting, except that the grant of options for 2003 shall be made as of the close of business on May 15, 2003. Prior to 2003, the annual option granted to each eligible Director shall be exercisable to purchase 1,000 shares of Common Stock. Commencing with the annual grant in 2003, each eligible Director shall be granted an option to purchase 7,500 shares of Common Stock. In 2006, each eligible Director shall be granted an option to purchase 10,500 shares of Common Stock.

Options granted during 2005 and thereafter shall be exercisable to the extent they are vested. Each option shall vest in equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, provided that on each vesting date, the Optionee is a Director of the Company. Vested options may be exercised prior to the date which is the earliest of:
 
(a) seven years after the grant date, (b) three years after the Optionee ceases to serve as a Director of the Company (one year in the event the Optionee ceases to meet the requirements of this Subsection by reason of his or her death), or (c) the date of dissolution or liquidation of the Company.

An option may be exercised in accordance with the instructions described in The Guide for Employees of Thermo Electron Stock Option Plans and any supplement thereto as they may be amended from time to time (the Guide). Upon exercise of the option in accordance with the aforementioned instructions, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Optionee the number of shares then being purchased, registered in the name of the Optionee or other person exercising the option. If any law or applicable regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other body having jurisdiction in the premises shall require the Company or the Director to take any action in connection with shares being purchased upon exercise of the option, exercise of the option and delivery of the certificate or certificates for such shares shall be postponed until completion of the necessary action, which shall be taken at the Company's expense.
No later than the date on which part or all of the value of any shares received upon the exercise of an option first becomes includible in an Optionees gross income for income tax purposes, the Optionee shall satisfy his or her obligations to pay any federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld with respect to such income in accordance with the provisions of the Guide. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no election to use shares for the payment of withholding taxes shall be effective unless made in compliance with any applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3.
Except as may be authorized by the Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, no option may be transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and during an Optionees lifetime an option may be exercised only by him or her (or in the event of incapacity, the person or persons properly appointed to act on his or her behalf). The Board or the Committee may, in its discretion, determine the extent to which options granted to an Optionee shall be transferable.
Neither the Plan, nor the quantity of shares subject to options granted under the Plan, nor any other action taken pursuant to the Plan, shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company will retain a Director for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.

(a) 
In the event of a stock dividend, stock split or combination of shares, or other distribution with respect to holders of Common Stock other than normal cash dividends, the Board or the Committee will make (i) appropriate adjustments to the maximum number of shares that may be delivered under the Plan under Section 4 above, and (ii) appropriate adjustments to the number and kind of shares of stock or securities subject to options then outstanding or subsequently granted, any exercise prices relating to options and any other provisions of options affected by such change.
(b) 
In the event of any recapitalization, merger or consolidation involving the Company, any transaction in which the Company becomes a subsidiary of another entity, any sale or other disposition of all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Company or any similar transaction, as determined by the Board, the Board in its discretion may make appropriate adjustments to outstanding options, including, without limitation: (i) accelerate the exercisability of the option, or (ii) adjust the terms of the option (whether or not in a manner that complies with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code)), or (iii) if there is a survivor or acquiror entity, provide for the assumption of the option by such survivor or acquiror or an affiliate thereof or for the grant of one or more replacement options by such survivor or acquiror or an affiliate thereof, in each case on such terms (which may, but need not, comply with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code) as the Board may determine, or (iv) terminate the option (provided, that if the Board terminates the option, it shall, in connection therewith, either (A) accelerate the exercisability of the option prior to such termination, or (B) provide for a payment to the holder of the option of cash or other property or a combination of cash or other property in an amount reasonably determined by the Board to approximate the value of the option assuming an exercise immediately prior to the transaction, or (C) if there is a survivor or acquiror entity, provide for the grant of one or more replacement options pursuant to clause (iii) above), or (v) provide for none of, or any combination of, the foregoing.
(c)  No fraction of a share or fractional shares shall be purchasable or deliverable pursuant to this Section 9.
The Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder in respect of shares as to which his or her options shall not have been exercised, certificates issued and delivered and payment as herein provided made in full, and shall have no rights with respect to such shares not expressly conferred by this Plan.
The Company shall at all times during the term of the options reserve and keep available such number of shares of the Common Stock as will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all options granted under this Plan and shall pay all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith.

The Company may require any person to whom an option is granted, as a condition of exercising such option, to give written assurances in substance and form satisfactory to the Company to the effect that such person is acquiring the Common Stock subject to the option for his or her own account for investment and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the same, and to such other effects as the Company deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with federal and applicable state securities laws.
Each option shall be subject to the requirement that if, at any time, counsel to the Company shall determine that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares subject to such option upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental or regulatory body, or that the disclosure of non-public information or the satisfaction of any other condition is necessary as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or purchase of shares thereunder, such option may not be exercised, in whole or in part, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval, or satisfaction of such condition shall have been effected or obtained on conditions acceptable to the Board or the Committee. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the Company to apply for or to obtain such listing, registration or qualification, or to satisfy such condition.
In the event of a Change in Control as defined in Section 13(B), the following provisions shall apply. If a Change in Control occurs while any options are outstanding, then, effective upon the Change in Control, each outstanding option under the Plan that was not previously vested shall become immediately exercisable in full.
