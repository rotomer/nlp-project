Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
Effective January 17, 2007, the Board of Directors of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the Company) approved an amendment to Section 5 of Article I of the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws for purposes of implementing a
majority
vote standard in uncontested director elections in place of the plurality vote standard. The new
majority vote standard provides that to be elected in an uncontested election, a director nominee must receive a majority
of the votes cast such that the number of votes cast for a director must exceed the number of votes cast against that director. A plurality vote standard will be retained for the election of directors only in the event of a contested election, where the number of nominees for director is greater than the number of directors to be elected.
A copy of the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized, on this 19
