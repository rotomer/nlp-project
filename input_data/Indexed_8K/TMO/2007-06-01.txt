Item 2.06  Material Impairments
As previously disclosed by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the Company), the United Kingdom Competition Commission has been investigating the Companys July 2006 acquisition of GV Instruments Limited (GVI), a UK-based provider of isotope ratio mass spectrometry instruments and accessories, to determine whether the transaction had resulted in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers (Gas IRMS), thermal ionization mass spectrometers (TIMS) and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers.  On May 30, 2007, the Competition Commission published its final report, concluding that the Companys acquisition of GVI would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK in the markets for Gas IRMS and TIMS products.  The Competition Commission has also concluded that a divestiture remedy is therefore appropriate and has determined that the Company be required to divest either GVI as a whole, or its Gas IRMS and TIMS assets,  to a purchaser approved by the Competition Commission.  As a result of the requirement to divest of GVI, the Company estimates it will record non-cash after-tax charges of $25-30 million as loss on disposal of discontinued operations, principally in the second quarter of 2007.  The loss primarily represents the carrying value of the business in excess of estimated disposal value.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized, on this 1 day of June, 2007.
