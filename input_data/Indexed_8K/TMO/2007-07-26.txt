Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
WALTHAM, Mass., (July 26, 2007)  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO), the world leader in serving science, reported that revenues increased to $2.39 billion in the second quarter of 2007 (largely as a result of the November 2006 merger with Fisher Scientific), compared with $713 million in the 2006 quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $.37 in 2007, versus $.29 in the year-ago period. GAAP operating income for the 2007 quarter was $243 million, compared with $72 million in 2006, and GAAP operating margin was 10.2%, compared with 10.1% a year ago.
Adjusted EPS grew 55% to $.65 in the second quarter of 2007, versus $.42 in the 2006 quarter. For a better year-to-year comparison of the companys operating performance, we are presenting our revenues and adjusted operating results on a pro forma basis, as if Thermo and Fisher had been combined for all of 2006. Second quarter revenues grew 9% over pro forma 2006 revenues of $2.19 billion. Acquisitions (including those by Fisher prior to the merger) contributed 1% of the growth, and currency translation increased revenues by 2%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased 25% over pro forma 2006 results, and adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 17.0%, compared with pro forma adjusted operating margin of 14.8% in the 2006 period. Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Second Quarter Highlights
 
We are pleased to report another record quarter, said Marijn E. Dekkers, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We achieved excellent adjusted EPS and operating income results on good top-line growth, and continued our trend of significant operating margin expansion. Weve now delivered three strong quarters as Thermo Fisher Scientific, clearly demonstrating that we are successfully operating as one company. High demand for our new products, healthy end markets and our continued operating discipline are all coming together to fuel this excellent performance.
Our customers are recognizing the true extent of our combined capabilities, and we are intent on leveraging our breadth of technologies and services to meet their needs. We continue to develop the integrated workflows our life sciences customers rely on to accelerate their research, from new mass spectrometry solutions introduced at ASMS to our new services for RNAi-based screening. Outside the laboratory, our technologies are helping customers comply with increasing environmental and consumer safety regulations, leading to record sales of our portable elemental analysis instruments and air-quality monitors.
Mr. Dekkers added, Based on our strong earnings in the first half, we are again raising our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year, and now expect earnings to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.56 for 2007, versus the $2.43 to $2.53 that we announced last quarter. This would lead to adjusted EPS growth of 31 to 34% over 2006. We are also increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $9.50 to $9.55 billion for 2007, from the $9.4 to $9.5 billion we previously announced. This would represent an increase of approximately 7 to 8% over our pro forma 2006 results. (This guidance includes the favorable impact of a full year of results from 2006 acquisitions and also takes into account the unfavorable effects of 2006/2007 divestitures. The 2007 guidance does not factor in any future acquisitions or divestitures, and is based on present currency exchange rates. In addition, the adjusted EPS estimate excludes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain other items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.)
Management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the companys business segments. Results in the following segment information are reported on a pro forma adjusted basis for 2006, as if Thermo and Fisher had been combined for the entire year.
Analytical Technologies Segment
Revenues in the Analytical Technologies Segment grew 13% in the second quarter of 2007 to $1.04 billion, compared with pro forma 2006 revenues of $915 million. Operating income increased 32% in the second quarter of 2007, and operating margin rose to 19.8%, versus pro forma 2006 results of 17.0%.
Laboratory Products and Services Segment
In the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, revenues grew 6% in the second quarter of 2007 to $1.43 billion, compared with pro forma 2006 revenues of $1.35 billion. Operating income increased 18% in the second quarter of 2007, and operating margin rose to 13.9%, versus pro forma 2006 results of 12.5%.
 
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards, the impact of significant tax audits or events and discontinued operations. We exclude the above items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We believe that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the companys performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.
 
For example:
 
We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities in connection with the Fisher merger and our Kendro acquisition. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.
 
We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and professional fees related to the merger with Fisher. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.
We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of 5 to 20 years. Our adjusted EPS estimate for 2007 excludes approximately $.84 of expense for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for acquisitions completed through the second quarter of 2007. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.
We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, benefits from tax credit carryforwards and the impact of significant tax audits or events, which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability and that we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. We exclude gains/losses from items such as the sale of a business or real estate, the early retirement of debt and debt facilities and discontinued operations.
 
Thermo Fishers management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the companys core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fishers results of operations included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fishers results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables. Thermo Fishers earnings guidance, however, is only provided on an adjusted basis. It is not feasible to provide GAAP EPS guidance because the items excluded, other than the amortization expense, are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, such as acquisitions and decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations.
