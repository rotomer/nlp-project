     On April 7, 2008, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with its president and chief executive officer, Marijn E. Dekkers (the "Employment Agreement"). Below is summary of the material terms of the Employment Agreement. The Employment Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The Employment Agreement is for a term ending December 31, 2017, and currently provides for an annual base salary of $1,165,000 and a target annual incentive bonus of 125% of base salary. The actual amount paid as a bonus in any given year is a multiple of zero to two times the target amount. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, equity grants awarded to Mr. Dekkers will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
     If Mr. Dekkers' employment is terminated (i) by the Company without "cause" or by Mr. Dekkers with "good reason," he will be entitled to: (A) an amount equal to the sum of: (1) three times his then current base salary, (2) three times his target bonus, and (3) a pro-rata bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs; (B) medical and dental insurance benefits for up to three years after the termination date; and (C) outplacement services up to $50,000; (ii) due to his disability, he will be entitled to: (A) disability benefits in accordance with the long-term disability ("LTD") program then in effect for senior executives of the Company; (B) his then current base salary through the end of the LTD elimination period; (C) a pro-rata bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs; and (D) medical and dental insurance benefits until the later of December 31, 2017 or 24 months after the termination date; and (iii) due to his death, his estate or his beneficiaries will be entitled to (A) payment of his base salary though the end of the month during which the termination date occurs; and (B) a pro-rata bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs. In the event Mr. Dekkers' employment is terminated for "cause" or by Mr. Dekkers without "good reason," he will receive his base salary through the date of termination.
     In addition, if Mr. Dekkers' employment is terminated due to his death or disability, by the Company without "cause," or by Mr. Dekkers with "good reason," (i) all stock options will become fully vested and will remain exercisable until three years from the termination date, except for options granted prior to November 21, 2002, which will remain exercisable for two years from the termination date (but, in each case, in no event beyond the expiration date of the options); and (ii) the transfer restrictions on all shares of time-based restricted Common Stock (i.e., those that do not include performance-based vesting) granted to him will lapse. If Mr. Dekkers' employment is terminated by the Company for "cause," (A) no further vesting of stock options shall occur and he shall have 10 days (except for the options granted to Mr. Dekkers before 2005, which he will have 90 days to exercise) to exercise all vested and outstanding stock options (but in no event beyond the expiration date of the options); and (B) all shares of restricted Common Stock granted to him as to which transfer restrictions have not lapsed
 
shall be forfeited. A termination of employment by Mr. Dekkers' without "good reason" shall have the same consequences as a termination by the Company for "cause."
     In connection with the execution of his Employment Agreement, Mr. Dekkers agreed in letter agreements that his outstanding stock option grants would not automatically accelerate upon a change in control, and to certain amendments to the stock option granted to him on March 5, 2008 to conform it to the terms of the Employment Agreement. These letter agreements between Mr. Dekkers and the Company are filed as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively. In the event of a change in control of the Company, shares of restricted stock granted to Mr. Dekkers prior to March 1, 2008 will vest and no longer be subject to restriction on transfer.

In furtherance thereof, it is the Parties' understanding that in the event of a termination under such circumstances, the Executive shall be entitled to receive benefits payable under Section 10 of this Agreement or Section 4 of the Executive Retention Agreement (but not both) determined on a benefit by benefit basis by the Executive and that the term "Other Benefits" as defined in the Executive Retention Agreement shall not include benefits payable under this Agreement.
          (e) . A termination of employment by the Executive on his own initiative, other than a termination due to death or Disability or Good Reason, shall have the same consequences as provided in Section 10(c) for a termination for Cause. A voluntary termination under this Section 10(e) shall be effective upon 30 days prior written notice to the Company.
Voluntary Termination
     All payments owing to the Executive under this subsection shall be made to the Executive in a lump sum payment within 30 days of the Termination Date; provided, however, that if the Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued thereunder on the Termination Date, then such payments shall be delayed until the date that is six months and one day following the Termination Date, if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

Taxes
          (i) In the event that the Company undergoes a "Change in Ownership or Control" (as defined below), including any Change in Ownership or Control prior to the Effective Date, and thereafter the Executive becomes eligible to receive "Contingent Compensation Payments" (as defined below) the Company shall, as soon as
 
administratively feasible after the Executive becomes so eligible determine and notify the Executive (with reasonable detail regarding the basis for its determinations) (A) which of the payments or benefits due to the Executive following such Change in Ownership or Control constitute Contingent Compensation Payments, (B) the amount, if any, of the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, by the Executive with respect to such Contingent Compensation Payment and (C) the amount of the "Gross-Up Payment" (as defined below) due to the Executive with respect to such Contingent Compensation Payment. Within 30 days after delivery of such notice to the Executive, the Executive shall deliver a response to the Company (the "Executive Response") stating either (1) that he agrees with the Company's determination pursuant to the preceding sentence or (2) that he disagrees with such determination, in which case he shall indicate which payment and/or benefits should be characterized as a Contingent Compensation Payment, the amount of the Excise Tax with respect to such Contingent Compensation Payment and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment due to the Executive with respect to such Contingent Compensation Payment. If the Executive states in the Executive Response that he agrees with the Company's determination, the Company shall make the Gross-Up Payment to the Executive within three (3) business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response. If the Executive states in the Executive Response that he disagrees with the Company's determination, then, for a period of 15 days following delivery of the Executive Response, the Executive and the Company shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within such 15-day period, such dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with Section 14 below. The Company shall, within three (3) business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response, make to the Executive those Gross-Up Payments as to which there is no dispute between the Company and the Executive regarding whether they should be made. The balance of the Gross-Up Payments shall be made within three (3) business days following the resolution of such dispute. The amount of any payments to be made to the Executive following the resolution of such dispute shall be increased by the amount of the accrued interest thereon computed at the prime rate announced from time to time by The Wall Street Journal compounded monthly from the date that such payments originally were due.

[THERMO ELECTRON LOGO]
     In consideration and as a condition of my employment, or if now employed, the continuation of my employment by Thermo Electron Corporation or a subsidiary thereof (hereinafter collectively called the "Company") and the compensation paid therefor:
     1. I agree not to disclose to others or use for my own benefit during my employment by the Company or thereafter any trade secrets or Company private information pertaining to any of the actual or anticipated business of the Company or any of its customers, consultants, or licensees acquired by me during the period of my employment, except to such an extent as may be necessary in the ordinary course of performing my particular duties as an employee of the Company.
     2. I agree not to disclose to the Company, or to induce the Company to use, any confidential information or material belonging to others.
     3. I understand that the making of inventions, improvements, and discoveries is one of the incidents of my employment, or that if not I may nonetheless make inventions while employed by the Company, and I agree to assign to Thermo Electron Corporation or its nominee my entire right, title, and interest in any invention, idea, device, or process, whether patentable or not, hereafter made or conceived by me solely or jointly with others during the period of my employment by the Company in an executive, managerial, planning, technical, research, engineering, or other capacity and which relates in any manner to the business of the Company, or relates to its actual or planned research or development, or is suggested or results from any task assigned to me or work performed by me for or in behalf of the Company, except any invention or idea which cannot be assigned by the Company because of a prior agreement with effective until (give name and date or write "none").
                    
                    
                    
                    
     4. I agree, in connection with any invention, idea, device, or process covered by paragraph 3:
          (a) To disclose it promptly in writing to the proper officers or attorney of the Company.
          (b) To execute promptly, on request, patent applications and assignments thereof to Thermo Electron or its nominees and to assist the Company in any reasonable manner to enable it to secure a patent therefor in the United States and any foreign countries, all without further compensation except as provided herein.
     5. I further agree that all papers and records of every kind relating to any invention or improvement included with the terms of the Agreement, which shall at any time come into my possession shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company and shall be surrendered to
 
the Company or upon request at any other time either during or after the termination of such employment.
     6. I further agree that the obligations and undertakings stated above in paragraph 4b shall continue beyond the termination of my employment by the Company, but if I am called upon to render such assistance after the termination of my employment, then I shall be entitled to a fair and reasonable per diem in addition to reimbursement of any expenses incurred at the request of the Company.
     7. I agree to identify in an attachment to this Agreement all inventions or ideas related to the business or actual or planned research or development of the Company in which I have right, title, or interest, and which were conceived either wholly or in part by me prior to my employment by the Company but neither published nor filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
     8. I understand that this Agreement supersedes any agreement previously executed by me relating to the disclosure, assignment and patenting of inventions, improvements, and discoveries made during my employment by the Company. This Agreement shall inure to the benefits of the successors and assigns of the Company and shall be binding upon my heirs, assigns, administrators, and representatives.
     9. I understand that this Agreement does not apply to an invention which qualifies fully under the provisions of any statute or regulation which renders unenforceable the required assignment or transfer of certain inventions made by an employee such as, but not limited to, Section 2870 of the California Labor Code.
 
     This Agreement, made and entered into this 11th day of July, 2000 ("Agreement"), by and between Thermo Electron Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Marijn E. Dekkers ("Indemnitee"):
     WHEREAS, highly competent persons are becoming more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to, and activities on behalf of, the corporation;
     WHEREAS, uncertainties relating to the continued availability of adequate directors and officers liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") and uncertainties relating to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that the difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;
     WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to obligate itself contractually to indemnify such persons so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified;
     WHEREAS, Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and/or take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he or she be so indemnified and that such indemnification be so guaranteed;
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:
     1. . Indemnitee agrees to serve or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company. This Agreement shall not impose any obligation on Indemnitee or the Company to continue Indemnitee's position with the Company beyond any period otherwise applicable.
Services by Indemnitee
     2. . The Company shall indemnify, and shall advance Expenses (as hereinafter defined) to, Indemnitee as provided in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Indemnity
     3. . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section 3 if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing or
General
 
other proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action, suit or proceeding covered by Section 4 hereof). Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and/or amounts paid in settlement incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection with such action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing or other proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative or any claim, issue or matter therein and whether or not Indemnitee is made a party thereto, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
     4. . In the case of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Company, indemnification shall be made to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law.
Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company
     5. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing or other proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing or other proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter by dismissal, or withdrawal with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.
Indemnification for Expenses of a Party who is Wholly or Partly Successful
     6. . The Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing or other proceeding involving his or her Corporate Status whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative within twenty (20) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing or other proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses, which undertaking shall be accepted by or on behalf of the Company without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make repayment.
Advance of Expenses
 
     7. .
Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
          (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.
          (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof, a determination, if required (but only to the extent required) by applicable law as a precondition to payment, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such determination be made by the Board or the stockholders, in which case the determination shall be made in the manner provided below in clauses (ii) or (iii)); (ii) if a Change of Control shall not have occurred, (A) by the Board by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even if less than a quorum, or (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum, or (C) if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) by the stockholders of the Company; or (iii) as provided in Section 8(b) of this Agreement; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorney's fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
          (c) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Agreement, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 7(c). If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him or her of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within seven (7) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent
 
Counsel" as defined in Section 14 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. If such written objection is made, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected or if selected, shall have been objected to, in accordance with this Section 7(c), either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom an objection is favorably resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 7(b) hereof. The Company shall pay reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred in connection with its acting in such capacity pursuant to Section 7(b) hereof. The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this Section 7(c), regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 9(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
     8. .
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
          (a) If a Change of Control shall have occurred, in making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
          (b) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 7 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made such determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(b) shall not apply (i) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Agreement and if (A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual
 
meeting thereof to be held within one hundred twenty (120) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within one hundred five (105) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Agreement.
          (c) The termination of any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution proceeding, investigation, administrative hearing or other proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative or of any claim, issue or matter therein by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
     9. .
Remedies of Indemnitee
          (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement, (iii) the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Agreement and such determination shall not have been made and delivered in a written opinion within ninety (90) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or such determination is deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within one hundred eighty (180) days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 9(a). The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
          (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 9 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 9 the Company shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.
 
          (c) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 7 or 8 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 9, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
          (d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 9 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.
          (e) In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 9, seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in Section 14 of this Agreement) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in such judicial adjudication or arbitration, but only if Indemnitee prevails therein. If it shall be determined in said judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.
     10. . To the extent requested by Indemnitee and approved by the Board, the Company shall at any time and from time to time provide security to Indemnitee for the Company's obligations hereunder through an irrevocable bank line of credit, funded trust or other collateral. Any such security, once provided to Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior written consent of Indemnitee.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of (a) ten (10) years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director or officer of the Company or director, officer or other fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise which Indemnitee served at the request of the Company; or (b) the final termination of all pending actions, suits, arbitrations, alternative dispute resolution proceedings, investigations, administrative hearings or other proceedings whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement relating thereto. This Agreement shall be

          (b) To the extent that the Company maintains D&O Insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such D&O Insurance in accordance with its terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director or officer under such policy or policies.
          (c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.
          (d) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.
     12. . If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Severability; Reformation
     13. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Agreement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, or any claim therein, initiated, brought or made by Indemnitee (i) against the Company, unless a Change in Control shall have occurred, or (ii) against any person other than the Company, unless approved in advance by the Board.

Employment Status; Termination Following Change in Control
     3.1 . The Executive acknowledges that this Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the Company any obligation to retain the Executive as an employee and that this Agreement does not prevent the Executive from terminating employment at any time. If the Executive's employment with the Company terminates for any reason and subsequently a Change in Control shall occur, the Executive shall not be entitled to any benefits hereunder except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 1.2.

Any Notice of Termination shall: (i) indicate the specific termination provision (if any) of this Agreement relied upon by the party giving such notice, (ii) to the extent applicable, set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) specify the Date of Termination (as defined below).

          (b) The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting any such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
          (c) Any Notice of Termination for Cause given by the Company must be given within 90 days of the occurrence of the event(s) or circumstance(s) which constitute(s) Cause.

          (i) "Change in Ownership or Control" shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.
          (ii) "Contingent Compensation Payment" shall mean any payment (or benefit) in the nature of compensation that is made or supplied to a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and that is contingent (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) on a Change in Ownership or Control of the Company.
          (iii) "Gross-Up Payment" shall mean an amount equal to the sum of (i) the amount of the Excise Tax payable with respect to a Contingent Compensation Payment and (ii) the amount necessary to pay all additional taxes imposed on (or economically borne by) the Executive (including the Excise Taxes, state and federal income taxes and all applicable withholding taxes) attributable to the receipt of such Gross-Up Payment.

Failure of the Company to obtain an assumption of this Agreement at or prior to the effectiveness of any succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall constitute Good Reason if the Executive elects to terminate employment, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as defined above and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise.
