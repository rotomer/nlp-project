WALTHAM, Mass. (October 23, 2008)  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO), the world leader in serving science, reported that revenues increased 8% to a record $2.59 billion in the third quarter of 2008, over $2.40 billion in the 2007 quarter. Currency translation increased revenues by 1.5%, and acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased revenues by 3%. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $.51 in 2008, versus $.49 in the year-ago period. GAAP operating income for the 2008 quarter was $286.3 million, compared with $254.0 million in 2007, and GAAP operating margin was 11.1%, compared with 10.6% a year ago.
Adjusted EPS grew 17% to $0.76 in the third quarter of 2008, over $0.65 in the 2007 quarter. Adjusted operating income for the 2008 quarter increased 12% versus 2007 results, and adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 17.5%, compared with adjusted operating margin of 16.9% in the 2007 period. Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Highlights
We are pleased to deliver another strong quarter, with good improvement year over year even though we saw some softness in demand toward the end of the quarter, said Marijn E. Dekkers, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Our diverse customer base, extensive geographic reach and attractive mix of consumables, instruments, software and services, give us a distinct advantage in the marketplace. Furthermore, we are carefully managing our cost structure while continuing to invest in new technologies, markets and commercial capabilities that will drive future growth. These strengths, combined with our extremely healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow, put us in a better position than most to weather economic headwinds and build on our industry leadership.
Mr. Dekkers added, In spite of the uncertainty in global markets, we are confident that we can deliver on our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. We are increasing the low end of our guidance by $.02, to a range of $3.13 to $3.17, which would lead to 18 to 20% growth over our 2007 results. Based on our revenue outlook at this point in the year, which includes a less favorable impact from foreign currency exchange, we now expect to achieve between $10.45 to $10.55 billion in revenues for 2008, resulting in 7 to 8% growth over 2007. (The 2008 guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, is based on present currency exchange rates, and the adjusted EPS estimate excludes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain other items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.)
Management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the companys business segments.
Analytical Technologies Segment
Revenues in the Analytical Technologies Segment grew 6% in the third quarter of 2008 to $1.09 billion, compared with revenues of $1.03 billion in the 2007 quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 15% in the third quarter of 2008, and adjusted operating margin rose to 21.1%, versus 19.4% in the 2007 period.
Laboratory Products and Services Segment
In the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, revenues grew 10% in the third quarter of 2008 to $1.61 billion, compared with revenues of $1.46 billion in the 2007 quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 9% in the third quarter of 2008, and adjusted operating margin was 13.9%, versus 14.1% in the 2007 period.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards, the impact of significant tax audits or events and discontinued operations. We exclude the above items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We believe that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the companys performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.
For example:
We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities in connection with the Fisher merger. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.
 
 
 
We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and professional fees related to the merger with Fisher. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.
We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of 5 to 20 years. Our adjusted EPS estimate for 2008 excludes approximately $.90 of expense for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for acquisitions completed through the third quarter of 2008. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.
We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, benefits from tax credit carryforwards and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as the one-time effect on deferred tax balances of enacted changes in tax rates), which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability and that we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. For example, we exclude gains/losses from items such as the sale of a business or real estate, gains or losses on significant litigation-related matters, gains on curtailments of pension plans, the early retirement of debt and debt facilities, and discontinued operations.
Thermo Fishers management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the companys core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes.
The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fishers results of operations included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fishers results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables. Thermo Fishers earnings guidance, however, is only provided on an adjusted basis. It is not feasible to provide GAAP EPS guidance because the items excluded, other than the amortization expense, are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, such as acquisitions and decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations.
