(the "Company") approved a new base salary and target bonus for Marc N. Casper, in connection with his appointment as president and chief executive officer of the Company. The Committee also approved new equity agreements for Mr. Casper, and certain modifications to his existing severance, change in control and noncompetition agreements with the Company. Below is a summary of the material terms of the actions by the Committee. The agreements are filed as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.7 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Salary and Bonus
     Under the new arrangement, Mr. Casper will receive an annual base salary of $930,000 and a target annual incentive bonus of 115% of base salary, retroactive to September 15, 2009 (the day the Company announced his promotion to president and chief executive officer). The actual amount paid as a bonus in any given year is a multiple of zero to two times the target amount.
Stock Option Agreements
     Pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement between Mr. Casper and the Company dated November 21, 2009, Mr. Casper was granted options to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The options (a) vest in equal annual installments over the five-year period commencing on the second anniversary of the date of grant (i.e., the first 1/5 of the stock option grant would vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant) so long as Mr. Casper is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions), (b) have an exercise price equal to $46.56, and (c) have a term of 10 years from the grant date.
     Pursuant to another Stock Option Agreement between Mr. Casper and the Company dated November 21, 2009, Mr. Casper was granted options to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The options vest in one installment on the day the performance goal related to the Company's stock price for any 20 consecutive trading days ending during the period October 15, 2009 through November 21, 2019 has been achieved, and the performance goal related to the Company's total shareholder return between October 15, 2009 and the date the performance goal related to the Company's stock price, or later (but no later than November 21, 2019), is achieved, relative to the performance of the S&P 500 Industrials Index for the same period, so long as Mr. Casper is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions). The options have an exercise price equal to $46.56, and a term of 10 years from the grant date.
Restricted Stock Unit Agreements
     Pursuant to the Time-Based Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between Mr. Casper and the Company dated November 21, 2009, Mr. Casper was granted 200,000 time-based restricted stock units of the Company. The time-based restricted stock units vest in equal annual installments over the four-year period commencing on February 15, 2012 (i.e., the first 1/4 of the restricted stock unit grant would vest on February 15, 2012 and each additional / would vest on each subsequent anniversary of February 15, 2012) so long as Mr. Casper is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions).

     Pursuant to the Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between Mr. Casper and the Company dated November 21, 2009, Mr. Casper was granted up to 400,000 performance-based restricted stock units of the Company. The number of performance-based restricted stock units to be earned (from 0 to 400,00) is based on the Company's total shareholder return for each of the applicable measurement periods, relative to the performance of the S&P 500 Industrials Index for the same period, assuming continued employment, subject to certain exceptions.

     Shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units, pursuant to each of the restricted stock unit agreements described above, would be delivered to Mr. Casper on the first anniversary of the applicable vesting date, subject to certain exceptions. Mr. Casper is required to hold 50% of the shares delivered (net of shares withheld for taxes) for a period of two years after delivery, subject to certain exceptions.

The following rules shall apply with respect to distribution of the payments and benefits, if any, to be provided to the Executive under this Agreement:
Payments Subject to Section 409A
          a. It is intended that each payment or provision of any benefit, as the case may be, provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued thereunder ("Section 409A"). Neither the Company nor the Executive shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any such payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A.
          b. If, as of the date of the Executive's "separation from service" from the Company, the Executive is not a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), then each installment of the severance payments and benefits shall be made on the dates and terms set forth in this Agreement.
          c. If, as of the date of the Executive's "separation from service" from the Company, the Executive is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), then:
               i. Each installment of the severance payments and benefits due under this Agreement that, in accordance with the dates and terms set forth herein, will in all circumstances, regardless of when the separation from service occurs, be paid within the Short-Term Deferral Period (as hereinafter defined) shall be treated as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b)(4) to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Short-Term Deferral Period" means the period ending on the later of the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the Executive's tax year in which the separation
 
from service occurs and the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the Company's tax year in which the separation from service occurs; and
               ii. Each installment of the severance payments and benefits due under this Agreement that is not described in paragraph c(i) above and that would, absent this subsection, be paid within the six-month period following the Executive's "separation from service" from the Company shall not be paid until the date that is six months and one day after such separation from service (or, if earlier, the Executive's death), with any such installments that are required to be delayed being accumulated during the six-month period and paid in a lump sum on the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's separation from service and any subsequent installments, if any, being paid in accordance with the dates and terms set forth herein; provided, however, that the preceding provisions of this sentence shall not apply to any installment of severance payments and benefits if and to the maximum extent that such installment is deemed to be paid under a separation pay plan that does not provide for a deferral of compensation by reason of the application of Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (relating to separation pay upon an involuntary separation from service).
          d. The determination of whether and when the Executive's separation from service from the Company has occurred shall be made and in a manner consistent with, and based on the presumptions set forth in, Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(h). Solely for purposes of this paragraph d, "Company" shall include all persons with whom the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) and 414(c) of the Code.
          e. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in-kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.
          f. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall have no liability to the Executive or to any other person if the payments and benefits provided hereunder that are intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A are not so exempt or compliant.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement under seal as of the day and year first set forth above.

Exhibit 10.7
EXECUTION COPY
     THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of November 21, 2009 is made by and between Marc N. Casper (""), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., a Delaware corporation whose principal offices are located at 81 Wyman Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02454 ("").
Employee
Employer
     WHEREAS, Employer, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, is the world leader in the manufacture, development and distribution of scientific and diagnostic instruments, equipment, supplies, workstations and chemicals used by clinical and research laboratories, universities and other life and health sciences customers, as well as diagnostic instruments, test materials and related products for clinical laboratories; and teaching aids for science education. In addition, Employer is a leading supplier of occupational health and safety products and maintenance, repair and operating materials. Employer is also a pioneer in the development of electronic and internet purchasing, marketing and distribution systems.
     WHEREAS, Employer has developed and continues to develop and use certain trade secrets, customer lists and other proprietary and confidential information and data, which Employer has spent a substantial amount of time, effort and money, and will continue to do so in the future, to develop or acquire such proprietary and confidential information and to promote and increase its good will.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Employee's continued employment by Employer or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof, Employee understands and agrees to the following:
     . Employee recognizes and acknowledges that it is essential for the proper protection of Employer's legitimate business interests that Employee be restrained for a reasonable period following the termination of Employee's employment with Employer, either voluntarily or involuntarily, from competing with Employer as set forth below.
Section 1
     Employee acknowledges and agrees that during the term of Employee's employment with Employer, and for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, engage, participate or invest in or be employed by any of the companies listed on Exhibit A attached hereto within the Restricted Area, as defined below, all of which are deemed by Employer and Employee to be competitors of Employer. The foregoing restrictions shall apply regardless of the capacity in which Employee engages, participates or invests in or is employed by a given business, whether as owner, partner, shareholder, consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise. In the event that after the date hereof any of the companies listed on Exhibit A is acquired by or is merged with a company not listed on Exhibit A, then Exhibit A shall be deemed to be amended to include the name of the acquirer or the successor to the listed company. After the date hereof, Employer may amend Exhibit A by written notice to Employee delivered within thirty (30) days following Employer's acquisition of a company after the date hereof, to add a competitor of such acquired company, and provided that such competitor has annual revenues at that time of at least $300 million. The previous sentence notwithstanding, in the event that after the date hereof, Employer is acquired by a third party, the right of Employer or its successor to add competitors to Exhibit A pursuant to the previous sentence shall terminate upon the closing of the acquisition of Employer.
 
     "Restricted Area" shall mean each state and territory of the United States of America and each country of the world outside of the United States of America in which Employer had developed, marketed, sold and/or distributed its products and/or services within the last two (2) years of Employee's employment.
     . During the term of Employee's employment with Employer and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after termination of Employee's employment with Employer for any reason, Employee will not: (i) employ, hire, solicit, induce or identify for employment or attempt to employ, hire, solicit, induce or identify for employment, any employee(s) of Employer to leave his or her employment and become an employee, consultant or representative of any other entity including, but not limited to, Employee's new employer, if any; and/or (ii) on behalf of any of the companies listed on Exhibit B attached hereto, solicit, aid in or encourage the solicitation of, contract with, aid in or encourage the contracting with, service, or contact any person or entity which is or was, within the two (2) years prior to Employee's termination of employment with Employer, a customer or client of Employer, for purposes of marketing, offering or selling a product or service competitive with Employer.
Section 2
     . For the period of twenty-four (24) months immediately following the end of Employee's employment by Employer, Employee will inform each new employer, prior to accepting employment, of the existence of this Agreement and provide that employer with a copy of this Agreement.
Section 3
     . Employee understands and agrees that the provisions of this section shall not prevent Employee from acquiring or holding publicly traded stock or other publicly traded securities of a business, so long as Employee's ownership does not exceed 1% percent of the outstanding securities of such company of the same class as those held by Employee or from engaging in any activity or having an ownership interest in any business that is reviewed by the Board of Directors of Employer.
Section 4
     . Employee acknowledges that the time, geographic and scope of activity limitations set forth herein are reasonable and necessary to protect Employer's legitimate business interests. However, if in any judicial proceeding a court refuses to enforce this Agreement, whether because the time limitation is too long or because the restrictions contained herein are more extensive (whether as to geographic area, scope of activity or otherwise) than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Employer, it is expressly understood and agreed between the parties hereto that this Agreement is deemed modified to the extent necessary to permit this Agreement to be enforced in any such proceedings.
Section 5
     . Employee further acknowledges and agrees that it would be difficult to measure any damages caused to Employer which might result from any breach by Employee of any of the promises set forth in this Agreement, and that, in any event, money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such breach. Accordingly, Employee acknowledges and agrees that if he or she breaches or threatens to breach, any portion of this Agreement, Employer shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies that it may have: (i) to an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach without showing or proving any actual
Section 6
 
damage to Employer; and (ii) if Employee fails substantially to cure such breach within thirty (30) days following Executive's receipt of written notice thereof from Employer, and if a final, non-appealable order is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction holding Employee liable for a breach of a material portion of this Agreement, to be relieved of any obligation to provide any further payment or benefits to Employee or Employee's dependents.
     . The parties acknowledge and agree that should it become necessary for either party to file suit to enforce the covenants contained herein, the prevailing party in such suit shall be entitled to recover his or its reasonable costs incurred in conducting the suit including, but not limited, to reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
Section 7
      Employee acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment and does not imply that Employer or any of its subsidiaries will continue Employee's employment for any period of time.
Section 8.
      This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and any previous agreements or understandings between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof are merged into and superseded by this Agreement.
Section 9.
      This Agreement cannot be modified, amended or changed, nor may compliance with any provision hereof be waived, except by an instrument in writing executed by the party against whom enforcement of such modification, amendment, change or waiver is sought. Any waiver by a party of the breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Agreement. The failure of a party to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement at any time shall not deprive such party of the right to insist upon strict compliance with such provision at any other time or of the right to insist upon strict compliance with any other provision hereof at any time.
Section 10.
      All notices, requests, demands, consents and other communications which are required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be deemed given when actually received or if earlier, two days after deposit with the U.S. postal authorities, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or two days after deposit with an internationally recognized air courier or express mail, charges prepaid, addressed as follows:
