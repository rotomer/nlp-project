Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On March 5, 2010, in connection with the Company's annual equity grant to employees, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the "Company") took the following actions relating to executive compensation, including for the Company's named executive officers:
     . The Compensation Committee granted stock options to Peter M. Wilver, Alan J. Malus and Seth H. Hoogasian, under the Company's 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. The stock option grants are evidenced by the Company's standard form of Stock Option Agreement for officers, a copy of which is on file with the SEC. Certain of the options (a) vest in equal annual installments over the four-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant (i.e., the first 1/4 of the stock option grant would vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant) so long as the executive officer is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions), (b) have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and (c) have a term of 7 years from such date. Certain of the options (a) vest in equal annual installments over the four-year period commencing on the second anniversary of the date of grant (i.e., the first 1/4 of the stock option grant would vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant) so long as the executive officer is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions), (b) have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and (c) have a term of 7 years from such date. The stock option grants approved by the Compensation Committee for the named executive officers are set forth in the table below.
Stock Options  Approval of Grant for March 5, 2010
     . The Compensation Committee granted time-based restricted stock units to Messrs. Wilver, Malus and Hoogasian, under the Company's 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. The time-based restricted stock unit grants are evidenced by the Company's form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1. The time-based restricted stock units vest in equal annual installments over the three-year period commencing on the date of grant (i.e., the first 1/3 of a restricted stock unit grant would vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant) so long as the executive officer is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions).
Restricted Stock Units  Approval of Grants for March 5, 2010
     The Compensation Committee also granted performance-based restricted stock units to Messrs. Wilver, Malus and Hoogasian, under the Company's 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. The performance-based restricted stock units are evidenced by the form of Performance Restricted Stock Unit Agreement which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2. In connection with the awards of performance-based restricted stock units, the Compensation Committee adopted as a performance goal the measure Company stock price. The number of performance-based restricted stock units to be earned is based on the Company's total shareholder return for the applicable measurement period, relative to the performance of the S&P 500 Industrials Index for the same period, assuming continued employment, subject to certain exceptions. The vesting of the performance-based restricted stock unit awards is as follows: up to fifty percent (50%) of the maximum restricted stock units would vest on the day the Compensation Committee certifies the performance level achieved for the first measurement period (January 1, 2010 through June 30,

2011), and up to fifty percent (50%) of the maximum restricted stock units would vest on the day the Compensation Committee certifies the performance level achieved for the second measurement period (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012), less the amount of restricted stock units that vested in connection with the first measurement period (but not less than zero), so long as the executive officer is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions).
     The time-based restricted stock unit grants and the minimum, target and maximum number of achievable performance-based restricted stock unit grants approved by the Compensation Committee for the Company's named executive officers are set forth in the table below.
