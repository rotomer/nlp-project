Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On February 23, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the "Company") took the following actions relating to executive compensation:
      The Compensation Committee approved the payout of cash bonuses for 2010 to the Company's executive officers under the Company's 2008 Annual Incentive Award Plan (the "162(m) Plan"), which was approved by the stockholders of the Company at its 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Compensation Committee exercised its discretion to lower the amount of the cash bonuses payable under the 162(m) Plan based on its determinations as to the level of achievement of the applicable supplemental performance metrics and goals for 2010 under the Company's annual cash incentive program, which operates in connection with the 162(m) Plan. The amount of cash bonuses approved by the Compensation Committee to be paid to the Company's "named executive officers" (as defined by Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K) is set forth in the table below.
Annual Cash Incentive Plans  Approval of Payout of Cash Bonuses for 2010.
      The Compensation Committee established the performance goal under the 2008 Annual Incentive Award Plan for 2011 as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, excluding the impact of restructurings, cost of revenues charges associated with acquisitions or restructurings, selling, general and administrative charges associated with acquisition transaction costs, gains/losses from the sale of a business or real estate, material asset impairment charges and other unusual or nonrecurring items ("Adjusted Operating Income"); and determined the percentage of Adjusted Operating Income that each of the Company's executive officers is entitled to receive as a cash bonus for 2011 under the Plan, subject to the Compensation Committee's right to lower, but not raise, the actual cash bonus to be paid to such executive officer for the year. The Compensation Committee's determination as to whether to lower the actual cash bonus to be paid to executive officers is generally based on the results of its determinations under the Company's annual cash incentive program for that year (which is described in the next paragraph).
Annual Cash Incentive Plans  Establishment of Criteria for 2011 Bonus.
     The Compensation Committee also established a target cash bonus amount for each of the Company's executive officers as well as supplemental performance metrics and goals for the Company under the Company's annual cash incentive program for 2011. The target amount for each of the Company's executive officers, which is a percentage of base salary (ranging from 45% to 130%), was determined by the Compensation Committee based on the salary level and position of such officer within the Company. The supplemental performance metrics and goals are based on (a) (70%) financial measures for the Company, comprised of growth in (i) revenue (adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and for foreign currency changes) (35%) and (ii) earnings (adjusted for restructuring charges and certain other items of income or expense) before interest, taxes and amortization as a percentage of revenue (35%) and (b) (30%) non-financial measures of the Company's executive officers' contributions to the achievement of certain business objectives of the Company. For each of the financial measures, the Company's actual performance will be measured relative to the Company's internal operating plan for 2011. After giving effect to the weighting of the supplemental performance metrics and individual performance, a range of performance for
 
the financial and non-financial measures, corresponding to a multiplier of 0 to 2, will be applied to the target cash bonus amounts for the Company's officers, including its executive officers.
     . Effective April 4, 2011, the Compensation Committee increased the annual base salary of the Company's executive officers. The annual base salary approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the Company's named executive officers is set forth in the table below.
Base Salary  Approval of Increases
     . The Company's executive officers have annual target cash bonus amounts, expressed as a percentage of their annual base salaries. The percentages for certain executive officers were adjusted by the Compensation Committee. The revised target bonus percentages approved by the Compensation Committee for the Company's named executive officers are set forth in the table below.
Revised Target Bonus for 2011
     . The Compensation Committee granted stock options to Messrs. Casper, Wilver, Herrema, Malus and Pesicka, under the Company's 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. The stock option grants are evidenced by the Company's form of Stock Option Agreement for officers (other than Mr. Casper), a copy of which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1. Mr. Casper's stock option grant is evidenced by the Stock Option Agreement between the Company and Marc Casper, dated February 23, 2011, a copy of which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2. The options (a) vest in equal annual installments over the four-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant (i.e., the first 1/4 of the stock option grant would vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant) so long as the executive officer is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions), (b) have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and (c) have a term of 7 years from such date. The stock option grants approved by the Compensation Committee for the named executive officers are set forth in the table below.
Stock Options  Approval of Grant for February 23, 2011
 
     . The Compensation Committee granted time-based restricted stock units to Messrs. Wilver, Herrema, Malus and Pesicka, under the Company's 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted stock unit grants are evidenced by the Company's form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.3. The restricted stock units vest in equal annual installments over the three-year period commencing on the date of grant (i.e., the first 1/3 of a restricted stock unit grant would vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant) so long as the executive officer is employed by the Company on each such date (subject to certain exceptions).
Restricted Stock Units  Approval of Grants for February 23, 2011
     The restricted stock unit grants approved by the Compensation Committee for the Company's named executive officers are set forth in the table below.

A Participant shall be deemed to have retired from the Company upon his or her resignation from employment with the Company either (i) after the age of 55 and the completion of 10 continuous years service to the Company comprising at least 20 hours per week or (ii) after the age of 60 and the completion of 5 continuous years service to the Company comprising at least 20 hours per week.
6. .
Restrictions on Transfer
     The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively "transfer") any RSUs, or any interest therein, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
     This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Participant with this Agreement.
8. .
Dividends; Other Corporate Transactions
          (a) If at any time during the period between the Award Date and the date that Shares are delivered after the RSU vests, the Company pays a dividend or other distribution with respect to its Common Stock, including without limitation a distribution of shares of the Company's stock by reason of a stock dividend, stock split or otherwise, then on the date the Shares issuable upon vesting of the RSU are delivered, the Company shall pay the Participant, at the time of delivery of Shares pursuant to Section 4, the dividend or other distribution that would have been paid on such Shares if the Participant had owned such Shares during the period beginning on the Award Date and ending on the respective delivery date. No dividend or other distribution shall be paid with respect to RSUs that are forfeited.
 
          (b) In the event of a Reorganization Event, then the rights of the Company under this Agreement and all other terms of this Agreement (including without limitation vesting provisions) shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and shall apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Reorganization Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to the Shares. Such cash, securities or other property shall be delivered or paid at the time provided in Section 4.
          (c) Except as set forth in Section 8(a) or (b) above and in the Plan, neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant shall be, or have any rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Shares issuable pursuant to the RSUs granted hereunder until the Shares have been delivered to the Participant.
9. .
Withholding Taxes; No Section 83(b) Election
     (a) The Participant expressly acknowledges that the delivery of Shares to the Participant will give rise to "wages" subject to withholding. Unless the Participant provides notice to the Company prior to the delivery of the Shares that the Participant will make payment to the Company on the date of delivery to satisfy all required withholding taxes, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company to hold back from the shares to be delivered pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement of that number of shares calculated to satisfy all such federal, state, local or other applicable taxes required to be withheld in connection with such delivery of Shares; provided, however, that the total tax withholding where Shares are being used to satisfy such tax obligations cannot exceed the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligations (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such wages).
     (b) The Participant acknowledges that no election under Section 83(b) of the Code may be filed with respect to this Award.
10. . The grant of an award of RSUs shall not be construed as giving the Participant the right to continued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with the Participant free from any liability or claim under the Plan or this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein.
No Right To Employment or Other Status
11. . In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any employment, severance or other agreement between the Company and the Participant, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
Conflicts With Other Agreements
12. . This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws.
Governing Law
13. . The right of the Participant to receive Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. The Participant shall have no rights under this Agreement other than those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
Unfunded Rights
 
14. . This Agreement is intended to provide for deferred compensation that is compliant with Section 409A and shall be interpreted consistently with such intent. Accordingly, a Participant shall have no right to designate the taxable year of payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if and to the extent any portion of any payment under this Agreement to the Participant is payable upon his or her separation from service and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant (through accepting the Award) agrees that he or she is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of "separation from service", except as Section 409A may then permit.
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code
     The Company makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to the Participant or any other person if any provisions of or payments, compensation or other benefits under this Agreement are determined to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A but do not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
15. . If the Participant engages in any conduct in breach of any noncompetition, nonsolicitation or confidentiality obligations to the Company under any agreement, policy or plan of the Company, then such conduct shall also be deemed to be a breach of the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. Upon such breach, this RSU shall be cancelled and, to the extent some or all of this RSU vested within a period of 12 months prior to such breach, the Participant shall be required to forfeit to the Company, upon demand, any Shares acquired by the Participant upon such vesting or cash acquired upon sale.
