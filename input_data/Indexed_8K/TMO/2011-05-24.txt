Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On May 19, 2011, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. ("Thermo Fisher") entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Phadia group, a global leader in allergy and autoimmunity diagnostics ("Phadia"). The Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") among CB Diagnostics Luxembourg S. R.L, a Luxembourg corporation (the "Seller"), certain funds managed and advised by Cinven Limited and Thermo Fisher, provides for the acquisition of the outstanding share capital of CB Diagnostics Holding AB, the holding company for the Phadia group companies.
     Under the Purchase Agreement, Thermo Fisher has agreed to pay the Seller approximately 1.052 billion in cash and to repay certain indebtedness owed by Phadia to the Seller and third party lenders. Currently, the amount of this debt totals approximately 1.411 billion.
     The Purchase Agreement and the accompanying warranty deed among Thermo Fisher, Igenza Cin AB, the Michael Land Family Trust and certain members of the management of Phadia (the "Transaction Documents") include warranties with respect to, among other things, title to the shares, due authority and certain aspects of the business that are provided by the Seller or members of management who are expected to receive a portion of the purchase price paid to the Seller. The Transaction Documents also include covenants regarding the operation of Phadia between signing and closing and restricting the ability of the Seller and Phadia management from competing with the Phadia business for a period after the closing. A portion of the sale proceeds will be contributed at closing to an escrow account for a limited period of time to satisfy any claims brought by Thermo Fisher for breaches of warranties and covenants.
     Thermo Fisher intends to use cash on hand and/or the proceeds from a committed bridge financing from Barclays Capital of up to $3 billion to facilitate the transaction.
     The closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals in the United States, the European Union and Japan. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2011.
     A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and a copy of the Warranty Deed is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this report, and such agreements are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the Warranty Deed do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement and the Warranty Deed.
