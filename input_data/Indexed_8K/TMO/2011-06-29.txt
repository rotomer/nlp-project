The Borrower will pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage a non-refundable duration fee, in Dollars or Euros, as applicable, on each of the 90th, 180th and 270th day after the Closing Date in an amount equal to the product of (i) the applicable Duration Fee Rate and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans of such Lender outstanding on such day.
Duration Fee
          (d) . The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees, in Dollars, in the amounts and at the times specified in their respective Fee Letters. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
Other Fees
     All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by the Administrative Agent's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
2.07 Computation of Interest and Fees.
provided
     The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
2.08 Evidence of Debt.
     
2.09 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent's Clawback.
 
          (a) . All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest of Base Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m., New York time on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on EURIBOR Rate Loans shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in Euros and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m., London time on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., New York time, in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after 2:00 p.m., London time, in the case of payments in Euros, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
General
          (b) (i) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or EURIBOR Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
Section 2.02
Section 2.02
 
Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
               (ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
     A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
          (c) . Except as otherwise provided in , if any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to the Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the Borrowing set forth in are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
Section 2.02(f)
Article II
Article IV
          (d) . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under .
Obligations of Lenders Several

               (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
     Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
     At any time that a Subsidiary of the Borrower is designated as or becomes a "subsidiary guarantor" under the Existing Credit Agreement or the CP Facility, the Borrower shall, after giving not less than 15 Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, designate such Subsidiary as a Subsidiary Guarantor to guaranty the Obligations hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed Subsidiary Guaranty in substantially the form of . All Guarantees of the Obligations by the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be automatically released to the extent that and for so long as (i) no Subsidiary of the Borrower guarantees, or is required to guarantee, any Qualified Indebtedness or (ii) any such guarantees of Qualified Indebtedness is to be released substantially concurrently with or, upon compliance with provisions of the instruments governing such Qualified Indebtedness that shall be satisfied, promptly after, the release of its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Subsidiary becoming a Subsidiary Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received such supporting resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents or information, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their reasonable discretion.

          (a) . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, that if the applicable Withholding Agent shall be required by applicable law to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, as determined in good faith by the applicable Withholding Agent, then (i) the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including withholdings or deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholdings or deductions been made and (ii) the applicable Withholding Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payments Free of Taxes
provided
 
          (b) . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
          (c) . The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within ten days after demand therefor for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or any other Loan Document, and any incremental taxes, penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Borrower
          (d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this , the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Lenders
          (f) .
Status of Lenders
               (i) Any Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of  7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
               (ii) Each Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any United States withholding tax (including each Participant that acquired a participation from a Foreign Lender) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have
 
been purchased) in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (or on or prior to the date on which such Participant acquires its participation from a Lender) (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or when a lapse in time or a change in circumstance renders the prior certificates obsolete), but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so, whichever of the following is applicable:
                    (A) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W 8BEN, W 8ECI or W 8IMY and any required supporting documentation (or any successor or other applicable form prescribed by the IRS certifying as to such Lender's entitlement to a reduction of or complete exemption from United States withholding tax),
                    (B) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "ten percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or
                    (C) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
     If a payment made to a Lender hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
     Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or
 
otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction, provided that in such Lender's reasonable judgment such documentation does not subject such Lender to a material unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
     Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that the Borrower or Withholding Agent make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
          (g) . If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
provided
     If any Law has made it unlawful, or any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans or EURIBOR Rate Loans or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate or the EURIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or Euros in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or EURIBOR Rate Loans, as applicable, or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall

also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted and, upon any such prepayment or conversion on a day other than the last day of the relevant Interest Period, all amounts due pursuant to .
Section 3.05
     If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or EURIBOR Rate Loans or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or EURIBOR Rate Loans, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate or EURIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or EURIBOR Rate Loans or (c) the Eurocurrency Rate or EURIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or EURIBOR Rate Loans does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or EURIBOR Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans and/or EURIBOR Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or EURIBOR Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.
          (a) . If any Change in Law, after the date on which a Lender becomes a Lender hereunder, shall:
Increased Costs Generally
               (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except (A) any reserve requirement contemplated by and (B) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost, other than as set forth below);
Section 3.04(e)
               (ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or EURIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender);
Section 3.01
               (iii) result in the failure of the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or EURIBOR Rate Loans; or
 
               (iv) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other material condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans or EURIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or EURIBOR Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to materially reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall have no obligation under this with respect to any additional cost or reduction suffered in connection with any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of ) or Excluded Taxes.
Section 3.04(a)
Section 3.01
          (b) . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law, after the date on which a Lender becomes a Lender hereunder, affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
          (c) . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
          (d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
          (e) . The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, without duplication of any Mandatory Cost, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as ""), additional interest on the
Additional Reserve Requirements
Eurocurrency liabilities
 
unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans and/or EURIBOR Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; the Borrower shall have received at least ten days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice ten days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable ten days from receipt of such notice.
provided

NOW THEREFORE
     (a) In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrower, each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all existing and future Obligations of the Borrower to the Beneficiaries, now or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether due or not due, and however arising under or in connection with the Credit Agreement, this Guaranty, the other Loan Documents (including those arising under successive borrowing transactions under the Credit Agreement and all renewals, extensions and modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the Beneficiaries in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof payable in accordance with, and to the extent provided in Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement) and whether recovery upon such indebtedness and liabilities may be or hereafter become unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against any

The books and records of each Beneficiary showing the amount of the Guarantied Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Guarantors and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guarantied Obligations absent manifest error.

Guarantied Obligations
     (b) Anything contained in this Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the ""), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor (i) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to the Borrower or other Affiliates of the Borrower to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and (ii) under any guaranty of subordinated Indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section 1(b), pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement.

Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a Guarantor under this Guaranty, each such Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Guarantors in the maximum amount permitted by law so as to maximize the aggregate amount of the Guarantied Obligations paid to the Beneficiaries.
     Each Guarantor represents and warrants that (a) it is duly organized or formed, validly existing and, as applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Guaranty, and all necessary authority has

     Unless the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be, shall otherwise consent in writing in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor agrees that, so long as any part of the Obligations under the Credit Agreement shall remain unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment, such Guarantor shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, perform or observe all of the terms, covenants and agreements that the Loan Documents state that the Borrower is to cause such Guarantor and such Subsidiaries to perform or observe.
3. Covenants.
     Each Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized and resident in the United States of America. Each Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless such Guarantor is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation (other than one arising with respect to taxes based on or measured by the income or profits of any Beneficiary) is imposed upon any Guarantor with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder, such Guarantor will pay to each Beneficiary, on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder, such additional amount in U.S. dollars as shall be necessary to enable the such Beneficiary to receive the same net amount which such Beneficiary would have received on such due date had no such obligation been imposed upon such Guarantor.

discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guarantied Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guarantied Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as such Beneficiary in its reasonable discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guarantied Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.
     Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Beneficiary) of the liability of the Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder; (d) any right to require any Beneficiary to proceed against the Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Indebtedness, or pursue any other remedy in such Beneficiary's power whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.
6. Certain Waivers.
     Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guarantied Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guarantied Obligations.
     . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guarantied Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against any Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
7. Obligations Independent
     No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guarantied Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and any commitments of each Beneficiary or facilities provided by each Beneficiary with respect to the Guarantied Obligations are terminated. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Beneficiary and shall forthwith be paid to each Beneficiary to reduce the amount of the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
8. Subrogation.
     This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guarantied Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any Beneficiary exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guarantied Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Beneficiary in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Guarantied Party is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.
     Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Borrower owing to such Guarantor (including any obligation or indebtedness of the Borrower owing to such Guarantor as subrogee of any Beneficiary in respect of any Guarantied Obligations), whether now existing or hereafter arising and in each case resulting from any Guarantor's performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guarantied Obligations. Nothing herein shall preclude the Guarantor from making advances to the Borrower or receiving payment of those obligations, to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement, in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default.
10. Subordination.
     In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any other Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Guarantied Party.
11. Stay of Acceleration.
     .

The obligations of each Guarantor under this section shall survive the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.
12. Expenses
     No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Guarantied Party and each Guarantor. No failure by any Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided are
13. Miscellaneous.
 
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. Unless otherwise agreed by the Guarantied Party and each Guarantor in writing, this Guaranty is not intended to supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by such Guarantor for the benefit of the Beneficiaries or any term or provision thereof.
     Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that the Beneficiaries have no duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Beneficiaries at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other guarantor (the guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Beneficiaries to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
14. Condition of Borrower.
     If and to the extent any payment is not made when due hereunder, any Beneficiary may setoff and charge from time to time any amount so due against any or all of each Guarantor's accounts or deposits with such Beneficiary.

               (ii) to the extent that any portion (the "") of the Defaulting Lender's Swing Line Portion cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of the proviso in clause (i) above or otherwise, the Borrower will, not later than five Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the Swing Line Lender) either, at the Borrower's option, (A) prepay (subject to clause (c) below) in full the unreallocated portion thereof or (B) cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender's Swing Line Portion (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (a) above) in accordance with procedures reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent for so long as such Swing Line Portion is outstanding;

Payments Free of Taxes
provided
          (b) . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (f) .
Status of Lenders
               (i) Any Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of  7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
               (ii) Each Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any United States withholding tax (including each Participant that acquired a participation from a Foreign Lender) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (or on or prior to the date on which such Participant acquires its participation from a Lender) (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or when a lapse in time or a change in circumstance renders the prior certificates obsolete), but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so, whichever of the following is applicable:
                    (A) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY) and any required supporting documentation (or any successor or other applicable form prescribed by the IRS certifying as to such Lender's entitlement to a reduction of or complete exemption from United States withholding tax),
                    (B) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "ten percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or
                    (C) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
     If a payment made to a Lender hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code,
 
as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
     Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction, provided that in such Lender's reasonable judgment such documentation does not subject such Lender to a material unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
     Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that the Borrower or Witholding Agent make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
          (g) . If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
provided
 
     If any Law has made it unlawful, or any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted and, upon any such prepayment or conversion on a day other than the last day of the relevant Interest Period, all amounts due pursuant to .
3.02 Illegality.
Section 3.05
     If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or (c) the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

               (iv) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other material condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to materially reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Borrower shall have no obligation under this with respect to any additional cost or reduction suffered in connection with any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of ) or Excluded Taxes.

Capital Requirements
          (c) . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
          (e) . The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, without duplication of any Mandatory Cost, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as ""), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; the Borrower shall have received at least ten days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice ten days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable ten days from receipt of such notice.

3.05 Compensation for Losses.
          (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
          (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
          (c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to ;
Section 10.13
including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange
 
contract. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing (not to exceed $250 per applicable transaction).
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

     (a) In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrower, each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all existing and future Obligations of the Borrower to the Beneficiaries, now or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether due or not due, and however arising under or in connection with the Credit Agreement, this Guaranty, the other Loan Documents (including those arising under successive borrowing transactions under the Credit Agreement and all renewals, extensions and modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the Beneficiaries in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof payable in accordance with, and to the extent provided in Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement) and whether recovery upon such indebtedness and liabilities may be or hereafter become unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against any
1. Guaranty.
 
Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law, and including interest that accrues after the commencement by or against the Borrower of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws (collectively, the ""). In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees that any Guarantor's payment of a portion, but not all, of the Guarantied Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge any Guarantor's liability for any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that has not been paid. The books and records of each Beneficiary showing the amount of the Guarantied Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Guarantors and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guarantied Obligations absent manifest error. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guarantied Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guarantied Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.
Guarantied Obligations
     (b) Anything contained in this Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the ""), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor (i) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to the Borrower or other Affiliates of the Borrower to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and (ii) under any guaranty of subordinated Indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section 1(b), pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement.
Fraudulent Transfer Laws
     (c) The Guarantors desire to allocate among themselves, in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty. Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a Guarantor under this Guaranty, each such Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Guarantors in the maximum amount permitted by law so as to maximize the aggregate amount of the Guarantied Obligations paid to the Beneficiaries.
     Each Guarantor represents and warrants that (a) it is duly organized or formed, validly existing and, as applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Guaranty, and all necessary
2. Representations and Warranties.
 
authority has been obtained; (b) this Guaranty constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms; (c) the making and performance of this Guaranty does not and will not violate in any material respect the provisions of any applicable law, regulation or order, and does not and will not result in the breach of, or constitute a default or require any consent under, any material agreement, instrument, or document to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property may be bound or affected; and (d) all requisite governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals for the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect; except in each case referred to in clause (a) or (c), to the extent that such failure to do so or such contravention, as the case may be, could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     Unless the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be, shall otherwise consent in writing in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor agrees that, so long as any part of the Obligations under the Credit Agreement shall remain unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment, such Guarantor shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, perform or observe all of the terms, covenants and agreements that the Loan Documents state that the Borrower is to cause such Guarantor and such Subsidiaries to perform or observe.
3. Covenants.
     Each Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized and resident in the United States of America. Each Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless such Guarantor is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation (other than one arising with respect to taxes based on or measured by the income or profits of any Beneficiary) is imposed upon any Guarantor with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder, such Guarantor will pay to each Beneficiary, on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder, such additional amount in U.S. dollars as shall be necessary to enable the such Beneficiary to receive the same net amount which such Beneficiary would have received on such due date had no such obligation been imposed upon such Guarantor. Each Guarantor will deliver promptly to each Beneficiary certificates or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by such Guarantor hereunder. The obligations of the Guarantors under this section shall survive the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations and termination of this Guaranty. At the applicable Beneficiary's option, all payments under this Guaranty shall be made in the United States. The obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or governmental authority affecting the Borrower, including but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of the Borrower's property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events in the countries where the Borrower is located.
4. No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments.
     Each Guarantor consents and agrees that any Beneficiary may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the
5. Rights of Beneficiaries.
 
enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guarantied Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guarantied Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as such Beneficiary in its reasonable discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guarantied Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.
     Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Beneficiary) of the liability of the Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder; (d) any right to require any Beneficiary to proceed against the Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Indebtedness, or pursue any other remedy in such Beneficiary's power whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.
6. Certain Waivers.
     Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guarantied Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guarantied Obligations.
     . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guarantied Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against any Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
7. Obligations Independent
     No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guarantied Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and any commitments of each Beneficiary or facilities provided by each Beneficiary with respect to the Guarantied Obligations are terminated. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of each Beneficiary and shall forthwith be paid to each Beneficiary to reduce the amount of the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
8. Subrogation.
 
     This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guarantied Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect with respect to all Guarantied Obligations only until all Obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and any commitments of any Beneficiary or facilities provided by any Beneficiary with respect to the Obligations under the Credit Agreement are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any Beneficiary exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guarantied Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Beneficiary in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Guarantied Party is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.
9. Termination; Reinstatement.
     Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Borrower owing to such Guarantor (including any obligation or indebtedness of the Borrower owing to such Guarantor as subrogee of any Beneficiary in respect of any Guarantied Obligations), whether now existing or hereafter arising and in each case resulting from any Guarantor's performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guarantied Obligations. Nothing herein shall preclude the Guarantor from making advances to the Borrower or receiving payment of those obligations, to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement, in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default.
10. Subordination.
     In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any other Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Guarantied Party.
11. Stay of Acceleration.
     . Each Guarantor shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Beneficiary (including Attorney Costs of any Beneficiary) in connection with the enforcement or protection of any Beneficiary's rights under this Guaranty or in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, including any incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in respect of the Guarantied Obligations and any incurred in the preservation, protection or enforcement of any rights of any Beneficiary in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws. The obligations of each Guarantor under this section shall survive the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.
12. Expenses
     No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Guarantied Party and each Guarantor. No failure by any Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
13. Miscellaneous.
 
exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. Unless otherwise agreed by the Guarantied Party and each Guarantor in writing, this Guaranty is not intended to supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by such Guarantor for the benefit of the Beneficiaries or any term or provision thereof.
     Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that the Beneficiaries have no duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Beneficiaries at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other guarantor (the guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Beneficiaries to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
14. Condition of Borrower.
