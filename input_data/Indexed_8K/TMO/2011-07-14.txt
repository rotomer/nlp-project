Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On July 12, 2011, by vote of the Board of Directors of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the "Company"), Lars Rebien Srensen was elected a director of the Company for a term expiring at the 2012 annual meeting. Mr. Srensen was appointed to the board's Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.
     Mr. Srensen has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Novo Nordisk A/S, a global healthcare company with a leading position in diabetes care, since November 2000.
     In connection with his service as a director, Mr. Srensen will be entitled to receive the Company's previously disclosed standard agreements and arrangements for non-employee directors as described in the "Director Compensation" section of the Company's proxy statement for the 2011 annual meeting, which was filed with the SEC on April 8, 2011 (File No. 001-08002), and will enter into the Company's standard form of indemnification agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Reg. No. 333-90661).
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On and effective July 12, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved amendments to Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Article II of the Company's By-Laws to eliminate the classified board of directors. The amended bylaws provide that the declassification of the board will not shorten the term of any incumbent director, so that all directors will be up for election annually beginning with the 2014 annual meeting. The amended bylaws also provide that directors are subject to removal by the stockholders with or without cause and that all directors elected from and after July 12, 2011 will serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders following such director's election. In all cases, service as a director is until the election and qualification of the director's successor and is subject to the director's earlier death, resignation or removal.
     A copy of the By-Laws of the Company, as amended and effective as of July 12, 2011, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K.
