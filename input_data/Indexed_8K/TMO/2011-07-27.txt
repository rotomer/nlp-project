News
 
 
WALTHAM, Mass. (July 27, 2011)  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO), the world leader in serving science, today reported its financial results for the second quarter ended July 2, 2011.
 
Second Quarter 2011 Highlights
 
Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
We delivered a solid second quarter, which keeps us right on track to meet our financial goals for the year, said Marc N. Casper, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific. In addition to record top-line results, we achieved record adjusted EPS, with 22 percent growth over the year-ago quarter. We are executing our plan and reaping the benefits of our investments in new products and emerging markets, our PPI productivity initiatives and effective capital deployment.
We had an exceptional quarter in terms of new product launches. This years ASMS showing was our strongest yet, with three new mass spectrometry systems that will revolutionize the way our customers perform analysis in a range of applications. In our specialty diagnostics business, we introduced six oral fluid tests that have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for drugs-of-abuse screening. On a separate note, two of our products made the list of the top 100 innovations in 2011.
R&D Magazine
We also continue to effectively deploy our capital to create shareholder value. Weve spent $2.1 billion on acquisitions completed so far this year. In addition to creating a leading chromatography portfolio with Dionex, we expanded our range of laboratory consumables with Sterilin, and last week acquired TREK Diagnostic Systems to broaden our microbiology offerings. Earlier in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Phadia, which will enhance our specialty diagnostics capabilities with tests for allergies and autoimmune disorders. Im pleased to report that the acquisition process is moving along faster than we expected and we now anticipate closing the transaction late in the third quarter. Finally, we deployed $225 million of capital during the quarter to buy back our stock.
For the second quarter of 2011, adjusted EPS grew 22% to a record $0.99, versus $0.81 in the second quarter of 2010. Revenues for the quarter grew 12% to $2.90 billion in 2011 versus $2.60 billion in 2010. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2011 increased 14% compared with the year-ago period, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 17.6%, compared with 17.2% in the second quarter of 2010.
On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex were owned for the entire second quarter in both years, revenues increased 9%, including a 4% increase from the favorable effect of currency translation and a 1% increase from acquisitions other than Dionex.
GAAP diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2011 was $1.36, versus $0.57 in the same quarter last year. Results in 2011 include the gain on sale of discontinued operations (primarily Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories), which increased GAAP diluted EPS by $0.79. GAAP operating income for the second quarter of 2011 declined to $265.8 million, compared with $297.9 million in 2010, due to acquisition-related charges. GAAP operating margin was 9.2%, compared with 11.5% in the second quarter of 2010.
Annual Guidance for 2011
Thermo Fisher announced that it is raising its adjusted EPS and revenue guidance for the full year 2011. The company is raising its adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 to a new range of $4.08 to $4.18 for 2011, which would result in 18% to 21% EPS growth over 2010. The company is also raising its 2011 revenue guidance by $80 million to a new range of $11.60 billion to $11.70 billion as a result of more favorable foreign exchange and recent acquisitions. This would lead to 10% to 11% revenue growth over 2010. This guidance does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Phadia and does not include any other future acquisitions or divestitures.
The 2011 guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates. In addition, the adjusted EPS estimate excludes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain other items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the companys business segments.
Analytical Technologies Segment
In the second quarter of 2011, Analytical Technologies Segment revenues increased 19% to $1.28 billion, compared with revenues of $1.07 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Segment adjusted operating income increased 27% in the second quarter of 2011, and adjusted operating margin increased to 21.1%, versus 19.9% in the 2010 quarter.
Laboratory Products and Services Segment
In the second quarter of 2011, Laboratory Products and Services Segment revenues increased 6% to $1.76 billion, compared with revenues of $1.65 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Segment adjusted operating income increased 2% in the second quarter of 2011, and adjusted operating margin was 13.6%, versus 14.1% in the 2010 quarter.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards, the impact of significant tax audits or events and discontinued operations. We exclude the above items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We also use a non-GAAP measure, free cash flow, which excludes operating cash flows from discontinued operations and deducts net capital expenditures. We believe that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the companys performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.
For example:
We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.
We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and significant transaction costs. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.
We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of 5 to 20 years. Our adjusted EPS estimate for 2011 excludes approximately $1.04 of expense for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for acquisitions completed through the end of the second quarter of 2011. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.
We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, benefits from tax credit carryforwards and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as the one-time effect on deferred tax balances of enacted changes in tax rates), which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability and that we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. For example, we exclude gains/losses from items such as the sale of a business or real estate, gains or losses on significant litigation-related matters, gains on curtailments of pension plans, the early retirement of debt and discontinued operations.
We also report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, net of capital expenditures, and also excludes operating cash flows from discontinued operations to provide a view of the continuing operations ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities.
Thermo Fishers management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the companys core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes.
The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fishers results of operations and cash flows included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fishers results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables. Thermo Fishers earnings guidance, however, is only provided on an adjusted basis. It is not feasible to provide GAAP EPS guidance because the items excluded, other than the amortization expense, are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, such as acquisitions and decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations.
