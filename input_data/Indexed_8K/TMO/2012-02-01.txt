Exhibit 99.1
News
 
 
WALTHAM, Mass. (February 1, 2012)  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO), the world leader in serving science, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Highlights
.
Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We were pleased to close 2011 on a strong note by delivering excellent revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter, said Marc N. Casper, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific. This solid performance capped another successful year, highlighted by 20% growth in adjusted EPS.
Our commitment to innovation drove significant product launches this year across all three business segments, and our expansion in high-growth emerging markets led to strong double-digit performance in China, India and Brazil. We are gaining significant traction with the additional share gain initiatives we launched in the second half of the year when the economic environment became more challenging. We also enhanced our leadership position by deploying capital on complementary acquisitions, and Im pleased to report that the synergies we outlined for Dionex and Phadia are both tracking better than we expected. Finally, we continued to deploy our capital to buy back our shares, spending a total of $1.3 billion in 2011.
 
Fourth Quarter 2011
For the fourth quarter of 2011, adjusted EPS grew 23% to a record $1.18, versus $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenues for the quarter grew 15% to $3.13 billion in 2011, versus $2.72 billion in 2010. On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned for the fourth quarter in both years, revenues increased 6%, including a 1% increase from acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia and a negligible impact from currency translation. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 22% compared with the year-ago period, and adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 18.9%, compared with 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $0.77, versus $0.75 in the same quarter last year. GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 7% to $343 million, compared with $321 million in 2010. GAAP operating margin was 10.9%, compared with 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, due to acquisition-related charges.
 
Full Year 2011
For the full year 2011, adjusted EPS grew 20% to a record $4.16, versus $3.46 in 2010. Revenues for 2011 grew 11% to $11.73 billion, versus $10.57 billion a year ago. Adjusted operating income for 2011 increased 16% compared with 2010, and adjusted operating margin expanded to 18.1%, compared with 17.4% a year ago.
GAAP diluted EPS for 2011 increased to $3.46, versus $2.53 in 2010, due primarily to gains on the sale of discontinued operations. GAAP operating income for 2011 increased 3% to $1.25 billion, compared with $1.21 billion a year ago. GAAP operating margin was 10.6%, compared with 11.4% in 2010, due to acquisition-related charges.
 
Annual Guidance for 2012
Thermo Fisher is initiating adjusted EPS and revenue guidance for the full year 2012. The company expects to achieve adjusted EPS in the range of $4.67 to $4.82 for 2012, which would result in 12% to 16% EPS growth over 2011. The company expects to achieve 2012 revenues in the range of $12.15 billion to $12.35 billion, for 4% to 5% revenue growth year over year.
Casper added, Although there is still uncertainty in the macro-economic environment, our proven strategy for creating shareholder value through the combination of revenue growth, margin expansion and effective capital deployment positions us to achieve our goals for 2012.
The 2012 guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current foreign exchange rates. In addition, the adjusted EPS estimate excludes amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain other items detailed later in this press release under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
 
Segment Results
Management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the companys three business segments, as highlighted below.
 
Analytical Technologies Segment
In the fourth quarter of 2011, Analytical Technologies Segment revenues increased 23% to $1.08 billion, compared with revenues of $880 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Segment adjusted operating income increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011, and adjusted operating margin increased to 21.1%, versus 18.7% in the 2010 quarter.
For the full year 2011, Analytical Technologies Segment revenues increased 19% to $3.85 billion, compared with revenues of $3.24 billion in 2010. Segment adjusted operating income increased 31% in 2011, and adjusted operating margin increased to 18.7%, versus 2010 results of 17.0%.
 
Specialty Diagnostics Segment
Specialty Diagnostics Segment revenues in the fourth quarter increased 32% to $705 million in 2011, compared with revenues of $536 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Segment adjusted operating income increased 42% in the fourth quarter of 2011, and adjusted operating margin increased to 24.0%, versus 22.2% in the 2010 quarter.
For the full year 2011, Specialty Diagnostics Segment revenues increased 15% to $2.47 billion, compared with revenues of $2.15 billion in 2010. Segment adjusted operating income increased 22% in 2011, and adjusted operating margin increased to 24.2%, versus 2010 results of 22.7%.
 
Laboratory Products and Services Segment
In the fourth quarter of 2011, Laboratory Products and Services Segment revenues increased 5% to $1.48 billion, compared with revenues of $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010. Segment adjusted operating income decreased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2011, and adjusted operating margin was 13.2%, versus 14.3% in the 2010 quarter.
For the full year 2011, Laboratory Products and Services Segment revenues increased 5% to $5.94 billion, compared with revenues of $5.65 billion in 2010. Segment adjusted operating income increased 1% in 2011, and adjusted operating margin was 13.7%, versus 2010 results of 14.2%.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which exclude restructuring and other costs/income and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards, the impact of significant tax audits or events and discontinued operations. We exclude the above items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We also use a non-GAAP measure, free cash flow, which excludes operating cash flows from discontinued operations and deducts net capital expenditures. We believe that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the companys performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.
For example:
We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.
We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and significant transaction costs. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.
We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of 5 to 20 years. Our adjusted EPS estimate for 2012 excludes approximately $1.33 of expense for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for acquisitions completed through the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.
We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, benefits from tax credit carryforwards and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as the one-time effect on deferred tax balances of enacted changes in tax rates), which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability and that we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. For example, we exclude gains/losses from items such as the sale of a business or real estate, gains or losses on significant litigation-related matters, gains on curtailments of pension plans, the early retirement of debt and discontinued operations.
We also report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, net of capital expenditures, and also excludes operating cash flows from discontinued operations to provide a view of the continuing operations ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities.
Thermo Fishers management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the companys core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes.
The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fishers results of operations and cash flows included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fishers results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying tables. Thermo Fishers earnings guidance, however, is only provided on an adjusted basis. It is not feasible to provide GAAP EPS guidance because the items excluded, other than the amortization expense, are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, such as acquisitions and decisions concerning the location and timing of facility consolidations.
