On June 22, 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (the "Company") senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of its Laboratory Products and Services Segment. The Company expects to complete such a transaction within 12 months. The Company will report the financial results of its laboratory workstations business as a discontinued operation beginning in the second quarter of 2012.
For 2011, the laboratory workstations business had revenues of approximately $180 million, and an operating loss of approximately $6 million, which is net of restructuring costs of $4 million. In the second quarter of 2012, the Company expects to record an after-tax charge of approximately $50 million as the estimated loss on the planned divestiture. Future revisions to the estimated loss on sale may be required depending on the actual or expected proceeds from a sale transaction.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized, on this 28th day of June, 2012.
