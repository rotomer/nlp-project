The Spin-Off
Following the close of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on December 20, 2011, Expedia, Inc. ("Expedia"), a Delaware corporation, completed the spin-off (the "Spin-Off") of TripAdvisor, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TripAdvisor") to Expedia stockholders. TripAdvisor consists of the domestic and international operations previously associated with Expedia's TripAdvisor Media Group and is now a separately traded public company, trading under the symbol "TRIP" on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Expedia continues to own and operate its remaining businessesthe domestic and international operations of its travel transaction brandsas a separately traded public company, trading under the symbol "EXPE" on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Prior to the Spin-Off, TripAdvisor was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Expedia, with Expedia as its sole stockholder. Expedia effected the Spin-Off by means of a reclassification of its capital stock that resulted in the holders of Expedia capital stock immediately prior to the time of effectiveness of the reclassification having the right to receive a proportionate amount of TripAdvisor capital stock. A one-for-two reverse stock split of outstanding Expedia capital stock occurred immediately prior to the Spin-Off, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.
Spin-Off Agreements
In connection with the Spin-Off, Expedia and TripAdvisor entered into the following agreements (collectively, the "Spin-Off Agreements"):
1. A Separation Agreement that sets forth the arrangements between Expedia and TripAdvisor with respect to the principal corporate transactions necessary to complete the Spin-Off, and a number of other principles governing the relationship between Expedia and TripAdvisor following the Spin-Off;
2. A Tax Sharing Agreement that will govern the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Expedia and TripAdvisor after the Spin-Off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other matters regarding income taxes, other taxes and related tax returns;
3. An Employee Matters Agreement that will govern a wide range of compensation and benefit issues, including the allocation between Expedia and TripAdvisor of responsibility for the employment and benefit obligations and liabilities of each company's current and former employees (and their dependents and beneficiaries);
4. A Transition Services Agreement that will govern the provision of transition services between Expedia and TripAdvisor.
A summary of certain important features of the Spin-Off Agreements can be found in Amendment No. 4 to TripAdvisor's Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-175828-01) (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 1, 2011. The section of the Registration Statement entitled "Proposal 1The Spin-Off ProposalRelationship Between Expedia and TripAdvisor
after the Spin-Off" beginning on page 72 of the Registration Statement is incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Separation Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 2.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
Governance Agreement
On December 20, 2011, in connection with the Spin-Off, TripAdvisor entered into a Governance Agreement (the "Governance Agreement") with Liberty Interactive Corporation ("Liberty") and Barry Diller, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of TripAdvisor and TripAdvisor's Senior Executive. The summary of the material terms of the Governance Agreement set forth below is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Governance Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. On December 20, 2011, in connection with the Spin-Off, Liberty and Mr. Diller also entered into a Stockholders Agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement").
Representation of Liberty on the TripAdvisor Board of Directors
Under the terms of the Governance Agreement:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Governance Agreement, TripAdvisor will cause each director that Liberty nominates to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors of TripAdvisor to the stockholders of TripAdvisor for election as directors at each annual meeting of the stockholders of TripAdvisor and will use all reasonable efforts to cause the election of each such director including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such persons. Liberty has the right to designate a replacement director to the board of
 
TripAdvisor in order to fill any vacancy of a director previously designated by Liberty. Liberty would have the right to transfer this ability to nominate candidates to the board of TripAdvisor, subject to the same ownership requirements as Liberty's current nomination rights, to its transferee in a Block Sale (as discussed below), provided that the transferee's nominees are independent directors and are approved by TripAdvisor's Nominating Committee (or equivalent committee of the board of TripAdvisor). In addition, the spun-off or split-off company in a Distribution Transaction will succeed to Liberty's rights under the Governance Agreement, including Liberty's right to nominate directors.
Contingent Matters
The Governance Agreement lists certain actions that require the prior consent of Liberty and Mr. Diller before TripAdvisor can take any such action, which are referred to herein as "Contingent Matters."
For so long as:
 
 
TripAdvisor has agreed that, without the prior approval of Liberty and/or Mr. Diller, as applicable, it will not engage in any transaction that would result in Liberty or Mr. Diller having to divest any part of their interests in TripAdvisor or any other material assets, or that would render any such ownership illegal or would subject Mr. Diller or Liberty to any fines, penalties or material additional restrictions or limitations.
In addition, for so long as the Consent Conditions apply, if TripAdvisor (or any of its subsidiaries) incurs any indebtedness (other than a customary refinancing not to exceed the principal amount of the existing obligation being refinanced), after which TripAdvisor's "total debt ratio" (as defined in the Governance Agreement) equals or exceeds 8:1, then for so long as the total debt ratio continues to equal or exceed 8:1, TripAdvisor may not take any of the following actions without the prior approval of Liberty and/or Mr. Diller:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preemptive Rights
In the event that TripAdvisor issues or proposes to issue any shares of common stock or Class B common stock (with certain limited exceptions) including shares issued upon exercise, conversion or exchange of options, warrants and convertible securities, Liberty will have preemptive rights that entitle it to purchase a number of common shares of TripAdvisor so that Liberty will maintain the identical ownership interest in TripAdvisor (subject to certain adjustments) that Liberty had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance (but not in excess of 20.01%). Any purchase by Liberty will be allocated between common stock and Class B common stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right, except to the extent that Liberty opts to acquire shares of common stock in lieu of shares of Class B common stock.
Registration Rights
Liberty and Mr. Diller are entitled to customary, transferable registration rights with respect to shares of common stock of TripAdvisor owned by them. Liberty is entitled to four demand registration rights and Mr. Diller is entitled to three demand registration rights. TripAdvisor will pay the costs associated with such registrations (other than underwriting discounts, fees and commissions). TripAdvisor will not be required to register shares of its common stock if a stockholder could sell the shares in the quantities proposed to be sold at such time in one transaction under Rule 144 of the Securities Act or under another comparable exemption from registration.
In connection with a transfer of TripAdvisor securities to an unaffiliated third party, Liberty or Mr. Diller may assign any of its or his then-remaining demand registration rights to the third party transferee, if upon the transfer the transferee acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of the outstanding equity securities of TripAdvisor. If upon the transfer the transferee acquires beneficial ownership of equity securities of TripAdvisor representing less than 5% of the outstanding equity securities, but having at least $250 million in then-current market value, Liberty or Mr. Diller may assign one of its or his remaining demand registration rights, which the transferee may exercise only in connection with an offering of shares of common stock of TripAdvisor having $100 million or more in market value.
Inapplicability of Anti-Takeover Provisions to Distribution Transaction or Block Sale
Pursuant to the Governance Agreement, TripAdvisor will not, in the case of a Distribution Transaction (as discussed below), implement any anti-takeover provision (including any shareholder rights plan) or, in the case of a Block Sale (as discussed below), will render inapplicable any such anti-takeover provision:
 
 
 
In addition, the Board of Directors of TripAdvisor will approve the transfer of Class B common stock and common stock in a Distribution Transaction or Block Sale (up to a 30% ownership level in the case of a Block Sale) for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), which is the prohibition on transactions with interested stockholders under Delaware state law. In the case of a Block Sale, however, such approval for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL will be subject to the imposition of contractual restrictions on the Block Sale transferee analogous to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL (as further described below).
Restrictions on Block Sale Transferee
For three years following a Block Sale by Liberty, the transferee will be subject to the following restrictions with regard to TripAdvisor, unless the restrictions terminate early in the circumstances discussed below:
 
 
 
The contractual provisions mirroring Section 203 of the DGCL would not apply to the transferee if upon the Block Sale it would not be an "interested stockholder" (as determined pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL) of TripAdvisor. However, if these contractual
 
provisions become applicable at the time of the Block Sale, they will continue in effect for the term of the standstill restrictions even if the transferee would subsequently cease to qualify as an "interested stockholder" (as determined pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL). The standstill restrictions and 30% ownership cap, as well as the termination provisions, would apply to subsequent transferees of all or substantially all of the shares transferred in a prior Block Sale, but in any event would not extend past the third anniversary of the original Block Sale. With respect to such unaffiliated subsequent transferees of the shares transferred in a prior Block Sale, the statutory (rather than contractual) anti-takeover restrictions of Section 203 of the DGCL would apply subject to the waiver, at the time of a transfer, by TripAdvisor.
Prior to the expiration of the three year term, the standstill restrictions, including the cap on ownership described above, would terminate at the earlier of (i) Mr. Diller and his affiliates "actually owning" securities representing more than 50% of the total voting power of TripAdvisor or (ii) the Block Sale transferee and its affiliates beneficially owning (as defined in the Governance Agreement) securities representing less than 12% of the total voting power of TripAdvisor and Mr. Diller beneficially owning (as defined in the Governance Agreement) securities representing more than 40% of the total voting power of TripAdvisor. For this purpose, securities "actually owned" by Mr. Diller and his affiliates will include all securities of TripAdvisor held by Mr. Diller and his "affiliates", plus those shares of Class B common stock for which Mr. Diller and his "affiliates" have a right to "swap" shares of common stock (as discussed below) but for which the swap right has not been exercised, minus the securities Mr. Diller and his "affiliates" currently hold but would need to exchange for the Class B common stock in such swap right.
The above restrictions may be waived at any time, by TripAdvisor, acting through a committee of independent directors.
Other Block Sale Provisions
Any Block Sale by Liberty within the two years immediately following the completion of the TripAdvisor Spin-Off will require the consent of TripAdvisor and Expedia. TripAdvisor and Expedia will not withhold their consent to such Block Sale if they determine in good faith (a) that a safe harbor exists for the Block Sale under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or (b) that during the two years immediately prior to the TripAdvisor Spin-Off there were no substantial negotiations with the transferee in such Block Sale regarding the Block Sale.
If Mr. Diller does not acquire from Liberty all shares of Class B common stock proposed to be transferred in a Block Sale or in a transfer of all of the Class B common stock and common stock beneficially owned by Liberty through the exercise of his "swap" rights or right of first refusal under the Stockholders Agreement (resulting in such Class B common stock of Liberty being converted into, or exchanged for, shares of common stock of TripAdvisor before the Block Sale), for a period of two years after the Block Sale, Mr. Diller will have the right from time to time to acquire from TripAdvisor an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held in treasury, either by purchase at fair market value, through an exchange of an equivalent number of shares of common stock, or a combination thereof. Mr. Diller may exercise this right either alone or in conjunction with one or more third-parties so long as Mr. Diller retains voting control over the Class B common stock acquired. Prior to the two year period following a Block Sale, Mr. Diller's right to acquire Class B common stock from TripAdvisor will be suspended
 
immediately upon the entry by TripAdvisor into a merger agreement providing for a merger that constitutes a change of control of TripAdvisor, and will terminate irrevocably upon the consummation of a tender or exchange offer for securities representing a majority of the total voting power of TripAdvisor or a merger that constitutes a change of control of TripAdvisor.
Certain Waivers
During the term of the Stockholders Agreement, without TripAdvisor's consent (to be exercised by a committee of independent directors), Mr. Diller will not waive Liberty's obligation under the Stockholders Agreement to convert or exchange its shares of Class B common stock to shares of common stock in specified circumstances. This consent right is not applicable if Mr. Diller no longer has any rights under the Stockholders Agreement. In certain circumstances this consent right will survive a mutual termination of the Stockholders Agreement for a period of up to one year.
Termination
Generally, the Governance Agreement will terminate:
 
 
With respect to the provisions governing "Contingent Matters," such provisions will terminate as to Mr. Diller and Liberty as set forth under "Contingent Matters," above.
Distribution Transactions
Liberty will be permitted to spin-off or split-off to its public stockholders all (but not less than all) of its equity ownership in TripAdvisor in a transaction meeting specified requirements (a "Distribution Transaction") without first complying with the transfer restrictions under the Stockholders Agreement, including Mr. Diller's tag-along right, right of first refusal, swap right and conversion requirement, and without being subject to the application of certain anti-takeover provisions, as described above under "The Governance AgreementInapplicability of Anti-Takeover Provisions to Distribution Transaction or Block Sale." The spun-off or split-off company will be required to assume all of Liberty's obligations (including the proxy given to Mr. Diller under the Stockholders Agreement) and will succeed to Liberty's rights under the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement (including Liberty's right to nominate directors).
Block Sales
So long as Liberty's equity ownership in TripAdvisor does not exceed 30% of the total equity securities of TripAdvisor and Mr. Diller continues to hold a proxy over Liberty's shares in TripAdvisor under the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty will be permitted to sell all (but not less than all) of such equity interest in TripAdvisor to an unaffiliated third party (a "Block Sale"), without being subject to the application of certain anti-takeover provisions, as described above under "The Governance AgreementInapplicability of Anti-Takeover Provisions to Distribution Transaction or Block Sale," subject to prior compliance with Mr. Diller's tag-along right, right of first refusal and swap right under the Stockholders Agreement, as well as the requirement that Liberty convert shares of Class B common stock to shares of common stock or exchange them for common stock with TripAdvisor before the Block Sale.
Prior to any Block Sale, Liberty will be required to exchange and/or convert any shares of Class B common stock proposed to be transferred in such Block Sale, to the extent Mr. Diller does not acquire such shares pursuant to exercise of his right of first refusal or swap rights, for newly-issued common stock (subject to application of relevant securities laws).
Relationship Between TripAdvisor, Mr. Diller and Liberty
Mr. Diller is the Senior Executive and Chairman of the Board of TripAdvisor. Mr. Diller and Liberty are parties to the Stockholders Agreement. Among other arrangements, under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty grants to Mr. Diller an irrevocable proxy with respect to all TripAdvisor securities beneficially owned by Liberty on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote or by which the stockholders may act by written consent (other than with respect to "Contingent Matters" with respect to which Liberty has not consented), until such proxy terminates in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. As a result of the arrangements contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement, as of December 20, 2011, Mr. Diller controls approximately 62.43% of the combined voting power of TripAdvisor capital stock and can effectively control the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of TripAdvisor's stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the holders of TripAdvisor's common stock of 25% of the members of TripAdvisor's Board of Directors and matters to which Delaware law requires a separate class vote). Upon Mr. Diller ceasing to serve in his capacity as Chairman of TripAdvisor, or his becoming disabled, Liberty may effectively control the voting power of TripAdvisor capital stock through its ownership of common shares of TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor is subject to the Marketplace Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (the "Marketplace Rules"). The Marketplace Rules exempt "Controlled
 
Companies," or companies of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company, from certain requirements. Based on the arrangements described above, TripAdvisor is relying on the exemptions for Controlled Companies from applicable Nasdaq requirements.
Warrant Agreement
On December 20, 2011, TripAdvisor entered into a Warrant Agreement with Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Equity Warrant Agent, and issued warrants exercisable for TripAdvisor common stock in respect of previously outstanding warrants exercisable for Expedia common stock that were adjusted on account of Expedia's reverse stock split and the Spin-Off. The TripAdvisor warrants, which are not listed on any stock exchange, expire on May 7, 2012. One tranche of TripAdvisor warrants (issued in respect of Expedia warrants that had featured an exercise price of $12.23 per warrant prior to adjustment) are exercisable for 0.25 (one-quarter) of a share of TripAdvisor common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.48 per warrant, and the other tranche of TripAdvisor warrants (issued in respect of Expedia warrants that had featured an exercise price of $14.45 per warrant prior to adjustment) are exercisable for 0.25 (one-quarter) of a share of TripAdvisor common stock at an exercise price equal to $7.66 per warrant. The exercise price may be paid in cash or via "cashless exercise" as set forth in the Warrant Agreement. TripAdvisor will not issue fractional shares of TripAdvisor common stock upon exercise of a TripAdvisor warrant; cash will be issued in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with the Warrant Agreement. Holders of TripAdvisor warrants are not entitled, by virtue of holding TripAdvisor warrants, to any rights of holders of TripAdvisor common stock prior to validly exercise such warrants.
Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement and subject to certain exceptions, the number of shares of TripAdvisor common stock issuable upon exercise of the TripAdvisor warrants and the exercise price of the TripAdvisor warrants are subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of various events, including stock splits; stock consolidations, combinations or subdivisions; stock dividends or other distributions; repurchases, reclassifications, recapitalizations or reorganizations and certain distributions of rights, warrants or evidences of indebtedness or assets. The TripAdvisor warrants are not subject to redemption.
The summary of the material terms of the Warrant Agreement set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Warrant Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference
Master Advertising Agreement (CPC)
In connection with the Spin-Off, certain TripAdvisor subsidiaries and certain Expedia subsidiaries entered into a Master Advertising Agreement (CPC). Such Master Advertising Agreement (CPC), dated as of December 20, 2011, was entered into by and between, on the one hand, TripAdvisor LLC, TripAdvisor Limited, and TripAdvisor Singapore Private Limited (collectively, the "TripAdvisor Companies") and, on the other, Expedia, Inc., Hotels.com LP, and Travelscape LLC (collectively, the "Expedia Companies"). Under this agreement, the Expedia Companies have agreed to continue purchasing click-based advertising, primarily in connection with the "check rates" feature on TripAdvisor websites, from TripAdvisor but also
 
including textlink advertising on TripAdvisor websites. The pricing for such advertising will be on a cost-per-click or revenue-share basis. The Master Advertising Agreement (CPCs) is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.6 (in redacted form pursuant to a confidential treatment request) and incorporated herein by reference. More information concerning this agreement, click-based advertising and its relevance to TripAdvisor's business model is contained in the Registration Statement.
Financing Arrangements
In connection with the Spin-Off, on December 20, 2011, TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC distributed approximately $405,516,330.67 in cash to Expedia in the form of a dividend. This distribution was funded through borrowings under a new Credit Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2011 (together with all exhibits, schedules, annexes, certificates, assignments and related documents contemplated thereby, the "TripAdvisor Credit Agreement"), among TripAdvisor, TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, and TripAdvisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London agent. The TripAdvisor Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior term loan to TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC in a principal amount of $400 million (the "Term Loan"), repayable in quarterly installments equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount in year 2012 and 2.5% of the original principal amount in each year thereafter, with the balance payable on the final maturity date. The TripAdvisor Credit Agreement also provides for a senior revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of $200 million (the "TripAdvisor Revolving Facility"). On December 20, 2011, TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC borrowed $10 million under the TripAdvisor Revolving Facility. All outstanding principal and interest under the Term Loan and the TripAdvisor Revolving Facility will be due and payable, and the TripAdvisor Revolving Facility will terminate, on December 20, 2016. The obligations of each borrower under the TripAdvisor Credit Agreement are the senior unsecured obligations of such borrower and are guaranteed by TripAdvisor (following consummation of the Spin-Off), TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC, and certain of their respective subsidiaries.
The Term Loan and any loans under the TripAdvisor Revolving Facility bear interest by reference to a base rate or a eurocurrency rate, in either case plus an applicable margin based on the leverage ratio of TripAdvisor, Inc. TripAdvisor, Inc. is also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, on the average daily unused portion of the TripAdvisor Revolving Credit Facility for each fiscal quarter and fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. The Term Loan and loans under the TripAdvisor Revolving Facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points or the alternate base rate plus 75 basis points, and undrawn amounts are currently subject to a commitment fee of 30 basis points. The proceeds of the Term Loan and any loans under the TripAdvisor Revolving Facility have been, and will be, used for general corporate purposes, including funding of the dividend described above. The TripAdvisor Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, restrictions and events of default, including, but not limited to, maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
 
The foregoing description of the TripAdvisor Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In connection with the Spin-Off, TripAdvisor Holdings, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, and TripAdvisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, both post-Spin-Off subsidiaries of TripAdvisor, were released from their guarantees of obligations under Expedia's existing $750 million revolving credit facility, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.456% senior notes due 2018 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.95% senior notes due 2020.

Restricted Stock Unit Agreement with Dara Khosrowshahi
On March 7, 2006, Expedia granted to Dara Khosrowshahi restricted stock units covering 800,000 shares of Expedia common stock, with vesting of such restricted stock units generally subject to the satisfaction of performance goals, including achievement of a specified level of operating income before amortization ("OIBA") in a given fiscal year. In connection with the Spin-Off, the parties agreed to divide the original award of restricted stock units between Expedia and TripAdvisor, in accordance with the treatment of shares of Expedia common stock in the Spin-Off, such that the initial award has been converted into (1) restricted stock units covering 400,000 shares of Expedia common stock governed by an agreement between Expedia and Mr. Khosrowshahi, and (2) restricted stock units covering 400,000 shares of TripAdvisor common stock governed by an agreement between TripAdvisor and Mr. Khosrowshahi (the "DK RSU Agreement"). On December 20, 2011, TripAdvisor and Mr. Khosrowshahi entered into the DK RSU Agreement. Below is a description of the material terms of the DK RSU Agreement. The description is qualified by reference to the DK RSU Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.5.
The DK RSU Agreement covers restricted stock units with respect to 400,000 shares of TripAdvisor common stock (the "RSUs").
Award.
For purposes of the DK RSU Agreement, "Service" generally means service as a director of TripAdvisor or, at the election of TripAdvisor, such other service to TripAdvisor at a level of time commitment commensurate with the time commitment as a director of TripAdvisor.
Service.
Subject to Mr. Khosrowshahi's continued Service through the applicable vesting date, 75% of the RSUs will vest upon TripAdvisor's achievement of a specified level of TripAdvisor OIBA (the "OIBA Target"); provided that at the election of TripAdvisor, such vesting will be conditioned on Mr. Khosrowshahi agreeing to provide Services to TripAdvisor for an additional two years following satisfaction of the OIBA Target. The OIBA Target will be determined after December 31, 2011 by adjusting the modified OIBA goal in effect prior to the Spin-Off to account for the occurrence of the Spin-Off.
Vesting (Generally).
