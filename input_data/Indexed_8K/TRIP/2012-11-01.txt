"As we drive continued traffic and content growth on a global scale, we are making wonderful strides to enhance the TripAdvisor experience for both our traveler community and our advertising partners alike," said Steve Kaufer, President and CEO of TripAdvisor. "These efforts, and TripAdvisor's record third quarter financial performance, put us squarely on track to meet our 2012 objectives."
Discussion of Third Quarter 2012 Results
Revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was $212.7 million, an increase of $31.9 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2011.
 
 
 
For the third quarter of 2012, U.S. revenue totaled $105.6 million, and represented 50% of total revenue, compared to 53% in the third quarter of 2011.
Revenue from the U.K. totaled $30.4 million, and represented 14% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2012, compared to 16% in the third quarter of 2011. Revenue from the rest of the world totaled $76.7 million, and represented 36% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2012, compared to 31% in the third quarter of 2011. Click-based advertising revenue and Display-based advertising revenue by geography are measured by the point-of-sale on which the transaction occurs.
Related-party revenue from Expedia increased 2% quarter-over-quarter and decreased 6% year-over-year to $56.9 million.
GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $59.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $54.3 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011. For the third quarter ended September 30, 2011, we computed diluted earnings per share using the number of shares of common stock and Class B common stock outstanding immediately following the spin-off from Expedia, as no TripAdvisor equity awards were outstanding prior to the spin-off.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2012 was $107.1 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 50%, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $93.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% for the third quarter of 2011.
Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter 2012 was $76.5 million, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 2%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2012 was $69.1 million, a decrease of 4% compared to the third quarter of 2011.
As of September 30, 2012, cash and cash equivalents were $548.4 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the financial measures presented in TripAdvisor's press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), TripAdvisor also reports Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and free cash flow, which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures. A "non-GAAP financial measure" refers to a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company's financial statements.
TripAdvisor defines "Non-GAAP net income" as net income before expenses related to stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets and non-recurring expenses, net of related tax effects.
TripAdvisor defines "Non-GAAP net income per diluted share" as Non-GAAP net income divided by non-GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which included dilution from options and warrants per the treasury stock method and include all weighted average shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Non-GAAP net income per diluted share.
TripAdvisor defines "Adjusted EBITDA" as operating income (loss), excluding depreciation of property and equipment, which includes internal use software and website development, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric by which management evaluates the performance of its business and on which internal budgets are based. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of TripAdvisor's core operations such as the costs incurred to spin-off from Expedia or those costs that do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, which is based on TripAdvisor's estimate of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs and other factors and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures. We believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
TripAdvisor defines "Adjusted EBITDA margin" as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.
TripAdvisor defines "Non-GAAP Selling and Marketing" and "Non GAAP Technology and Content" expenses as GAAP Selling and Marketing and GAAP Technology and Content expenses, respectively, before stock-based compensation expense. The Company defines "Non-GAAP General and Administrative" expense as GAAP General and Administrative expense, including related-party shared services expense and before stock-based compensation expense.
TripAdvisor defines "free cash flow" as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures, which are purchases of property and equipment, including capitalization of internal-use software development costs. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as these measures allow a more meaningful comparison of our projected cash earnings and performance with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, management uses these measures internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole.
TripAdvisor provides these non-GAAP financial measures as additional information relating to TripAdvisor's operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. The non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of TripAdvisor's liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare the Company's performance to that of other companies. TripAdvisor endeavors to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures.
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we present a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measure below.
