Exhibit 99
T. ROWE PRICE GROUP REPORTS STRONG THIRD QUARTER 2003 RESULTS
Assets Under Management at Highest Level in Three Years
BALTIMORE (October 24, 2003)  T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: TROW) today reported 2003 third quarter net revenues of $258 million, net income of $66.3 million, and diluted earnings per share of $.51. For the comparable 2002 quarter, the firm had net revenues of nearly $222 million, net income of $43.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $.34. Assets under management increased to $168.9 billion at September 30, 2003, up from $161.2 billion at the beginning of the third quarter this year and the highest period-end level since September 30, 2000 when assets under management were $179.6 billion.
For the first nine months of 2003, the firm's net revenues were up more than $10 million from nearly $704 million for the same period last year to $714.4 million. Net income was $158.8 million versus $148.1 million for the first nine months of 2002 and diluted earnings per share were $1.25 versus $1.15 in the 2002 period. Operating expenses increased $3.8 million to nearly $460 million for the first nine months of 2003 compared to almost $456 million during the same period last year.
Assets under management increased $7.8 billion during the third quarter as a result of market appreciation of $5.1 billion and net cash inflows of more than $2.6 billion. The T. Rowe Price mutual funds had about $1.6 billion of net cash inflows. Stock funds had net investor subscriptions of $1.8 billion while bond and money market funds experienced net cash outflows of $.2 billion. An additional $1.1 billion in net cash subscriptions was added to other sponsored portfolios.
George A. Roche, the company's chairman and president, commented: "As the market has returned to levels not seen in over a year, we continue to benefit from the performance of our managed investment portfolios. Following their strong relative performance during the bear market, the T. Rowe Price funds have continued to perform well relative to their peers in the current environment, with 60% of our rated retail funds garnering an overall rating of four or five stars from Morningstar as of September 30, 2003. In addition, at least 77% of our funds and their share classes surpassed their Lipper averages on a total return basis for the one-, three-, five-, and ten-year periods ended September 30, 2003. We are encouraged by signs that individual investors continue to commit substantial assets to the equity markets, and illustrative of the firm's diversification, the third quarter results were supported by inflows across our multiple distribution channels.
"It is also important to note that mutual fund flows were generally consistent throughout the quarter, including in September following the investigation of mutual fund trading practices made by the New York State Attorney General. As a global investment management firm with a significant presence in the U.S. mutual fund industry, we recognize the potential impact that these issues have on the trust that investors place in us. We condemn the actions described by the New York Attorney General."
Advisory revenues are up $36.6 million versus the 2002 quarter due primarily to increased assets under management. Average mutual fund assets under management were $103.4 billion this quarter compared to $86.6 billion in the third quarter last year. Market appreciation and income increased mutual fund assets $3.0 billion and net investor inflows added almost $1.6 billion during the quarter to increase fund assets from $100.1 billion at the beginning of the quarter to $104.7 billion at September 30, 2003. The Equity Income and Mid-Cap Growth funds had strong net cash inflows during the 2003 quarter as investors added $.9 billion to these two funds. Additionally, our other managed investment portfolios increased from nearly $61.1 billion at the beginning of the quarter to more than $64.2 billion at September 30, 2003. Market appreciation and income of $2.1 billion and net investor inflows of $1.1 billion drove this increase. New institutional clients investing in U.S. domestic investment portfolios and additional flows from our third-party distribution network into subadvised funds were the primary contributors of net inflows this quarter.
 
Operating expenses increased $4.1 million from the previous year's quarter to $152.7 million. Increases in compensation and related costs were partially offset by decreased spending in almost all of the other operating expense categories. While the firm held back its advertising and promotion spending in the third quarter, continued strengthening in the financial markets and growing investor interest, coupled with the fourth quarter seasonal aspect of ad spending, will lead the firm to increase its spending in the fourth quarter. "We expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2003 may be up to double that of the third quarter 2003," said Mr. Roche.
Net operating income increased $32.6 million to $105.5 million for the third quarter of 2003. Net non-operating results from investment income net of debt expenses rose from a loss of $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2002 to a gain of nearly $.3 million in the third quarter 2003. Third quarter 2003 results were tempered by a $.9 million loss from exchange rate fluctuations on the company's yen debt.
"Our corporate earnings and cash flow remain very strong and give us substantial financial flexibility," Mr. Roche added. "We have repaid nearly $44 million of debt this year and expect to retire our remaining yen-denominated bank borrowing of $13 million in November 2003."
In closing, Mr. Roche said: "Generally favorable corporate earnings, improving economic trends, and assurances from the Federal Reserve that short-term interest rates can remain low for a considerable period' contributed to the stock market's continued resurgence in the third quarter. We believe the remainder of the year should remain favorable for the financial markets and for the company. Sustained and steady economic growth, continued recovery in corporate earnings, attractive valuations in many sectors, and the favorable interest rate and inflation environment should continue to offer prudent long-term investors a more welcoming environment moving forward."
