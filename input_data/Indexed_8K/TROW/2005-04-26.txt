T. ROWE PRICE GROUP REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Record Assets Under Management Reach Nearly $236 Billion; Reelection of Directors Expected at Annual Meeting Today
BALTIMORE (April 26, 2005)  T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: TROW) today reported record first quarter 2005 net revenues of more than $357 million, net income of $94 million, and diluted earnings per share of $.69, an increase of 19% from the $.58 per share reported for the first quarter of 2004. Comparable net revenues in the first quarter of 2004 were nearly $306 million and net income was more than $77 million.
Operating expenses for the 2005 quarter were up $27 million or 15% to nearly $210 million. Net operating income was $147 million, up more than $24 million or 20% compared to the 2004 period. Net non-operating income also increased to about $2 million from $.8 million.
Assets under management increased to a record $235.9 billion at March 31, 2005, up $670 million from the previous high of $235.2 billion at the end of 2004, and up 17% from $201.0 billion at March 31, 2004.
Investment advisory revenues were up 18%, or $44 million versus the 2004 quarter. Record average assets under management were $234.7 billion, more than $37 billion higher than the average of the 2004 quarter.
Financial Highlights
Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States increased nearly $33 million. Mutual fund assets ended March 2005 at $148.3 billion, up $2.8 billion from the beginning of 2005. Net investor inflows added $5.5 billion to mutual fund assets during the quarter, more than offsetting the effect of market value declines that reduced mutual fund assets $2.7 billion during this past quarter. Net cash inflows were
 
concentrated in the U.S. stock funds, but were also positive in the international stock, bond, and money market funds. The Growth Stock, Capital Appreciation, Equity Income, and Mid-Cap Value funds each added more than $500 million of net investor inflows and, together, accounted for nearly $3.1 billion of the funds' net inflows. In addition, our series of target date Retirement Funds, which are designed to provide shareholders with single, diversified portfolios that invest in underlying T. Rowe Price funds and automatically shift asset allocations between funds as the investor ages, have continued to see very strong asset growth. These funds had net subscriptions of nearly $1 billion during the first quarter and now total about $4.5 billion.
Investment advisory revenues earned from other managed investment portfolios consisting of institutional separate accounts, sub-advised funds, sponsored mutual funds which are offered to non-U.S. investors, and variable insurance portfolios increased $11 million to nearly $81 million. Ending assets in these portfolios were $87.6 billion, down $2.1 billion from the beginning of 2005. Market value declines lowered these assets under management $1.8 billion and investors made net withdrawals of $.3 billion from these portfolios.
Operating expenses in the 2005 quarter were $27 million more than in the 2004 quarter. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, increased more than $17 million from the first quarter of 2004. The number of our associates, their total compensation costs, and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased. The firm has added about 400 associates since the beginning of 2004, primarily to handle volume-related activities and business growth. At March 31, 2005, we employed 4,185 associates across the globe.
Advertising and promotion expenditures were up $2.4 million versus the 2004 period. These costs in the second quarter of 2005 will decline about 15% to 20% from the first quarter of this year, while our expenditures for the full year 2005 will be 10% to 15% higher than 2004. The firm varies its level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand.
Other operating expenses increased nearly $5 million, including more than $1 million that results from the decision to pay for all third party investment research and related services directly and
 
more that $1.3 million for distribution costs of our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares that are based on greater assets under management and are offset by administrative revenues of the same amount.
Overall, net operating income for 2005 increased 20% to more than $147 million.
George A. Roche, the company's chairman and president, commented: "The firm's investment advisory results relative to our peers remain very strong, with more than 82% of the T. Rowe Price funds across their share classes surpassing their Lipper averages on a total return basis for the one- and three-year periods ended March 31, 2005 and more than 72% outperforming the average for the five- and 10-year periods. In addition, 60% of our rated retail funds ended the quarter with an overall rating of four or five stars from Morningstar, compared with 32.5% for the overall industry.
Chairman Commentary
"Although the year so far has been lackluster at best for the financial markets, we continue to be encouraged by business across our distribution channels and strong investment management results. Our corporate earnings and cash flow remain very strong and give us substantial financial flexibility. As a result we have been able to invest in our business and our people, and repurchase 600,000 shares of our common stock. We also remain debt free and have cash and net liquid investments of $650 million at March 31, 2005.
"Although the Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising short-term interest rates, and investors remain concerned about high oil prices and continued geopolitical risks, we believe the outlook for equities is modestly positive for the remainder of 2005. The market has declined this year, stock valuations are reasonable in many sectors, corporate earnings remain strong, and there are substantial liquid assets held by individuals and institutions that could be reallocated to equities."
In closing, Mr. Roche said: "We believe the outlook for our company remains very strong. Our diversified business model and broad product lineup is designed to compete well in a dynamic
 
and ever-changing marketplace, and our sound financial position gives us the flexibility to take advantage of industry or market opportunities. The T. Rowe Price brand is increasingly visible and respected in the marketplace, and we are well positioned for growth in the months and years ahead."
During the Company's annual meeting, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. today in Baltimore, stockholders are expected to reelect all 11 nominees to the Board of Directors. Stockholders are also expected to ratify the reappointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent accountant.
