On January 31, 2006, we entered into a consulting agreement with James S. Riepe. Mr. Riepe is currently a member of our Board of Directors and is the Chairman of 57 of the mutual funds organized and advised by our subsidiaries. As previously disclosed, he has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election at our 2006 annual meeting of stockholders and that he will step down from his positions with the mutual funds around that same time. Mr. Riepe was our Vice Chairman and the director of our Investment Services Division prior to his retirement at the end of 2005.
Pursuant to the consulting agreement, Mr. Riepe will provide strategic and other consulting services to us, as mutually agreed between Mr. Riepe and our Chief Executive Officer, over an aggregate of up to eight weeks of full-time days in each calendar year. The consulting agreement is effective as of January 1, 2006, and thereafter is automatically renewed on January 1 of each year. However, after April 30, 2006, it can be terminated by either party for any reason upon at least 30 days prior written notice. In consideration of his consulting services we have agreed to pay Mr. Riepe $116,667 for the period ending April 30, 2006, $66,667 for the period from May 1 through December 31, 2006, and $100,000 per year for subsequent years, plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
A copy of the consulting agreement is attached as Exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
