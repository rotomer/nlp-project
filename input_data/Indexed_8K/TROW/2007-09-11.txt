We submit herewith a series of XBRL-formatted documents as Exhibit 100. These documents present information from our complete set of consolidated financial statements (our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2006, and our related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006) that we previously filed in Item 8 of our Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2006 (Accession No. 0000950133-07-000416). The financial information in the XBRL-formatted documents is unaudited. These XBRL-formatted documents have been prepared pursuant to Rule 401 of Regulation S-T and are presented in electronic format using XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language).

The purpose of submitting these documents is to test the related XBRL format and technology and, as a result, investors and others should continue to rely on the official filed version of our audited financial statements contained in our Form 10-K filing and should not rely on the XBRL-formatted documents in making investment decisions.
