T. ROWE PRICE GROUP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL 2011 RESULTS
Assets Under Management Ended 2011 at $489.5 Billion
BALTIMORE (January 27, 2012)  T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ-GS: TROW) today reported its fourth quarter 2011 results, including net revenues of $671.6 million, net income of $188.4 million, and diluted earnings per common share of $.73. In the fourth quarter of 2010, net revenues were $647.5 million, net income was $191.6 million, and diluted earnings per common share was $.72.
Investment advisory revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased $10.0 million to $570.5 million from the comparable 2010 period, as average assets under management were up 5%. Assets under management at December 31, 2011 totaled $489.5 billion, an increase of $36 billion from $453.5 billion at September 30, 2011. The increase in assets under management in the fourth quarter of 2011 is attributable to net cash inflows of $1.1 billion, and market appreciation and income of $34.9 billion.
Year-end assets under management of $489.5 billion increased $7.5 billion from $482.0 billion at the end of 2010, and include $289.4 billion in T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States and $200.1 billion in other managed investment portfolios. Net cash inflows from investors of $14.1 billion in 2011, including $8.0 billion originating in the target-date retirement portfolios, were offset by $6.6 billion in market depreciation and income not reinvested. Year-end assets in the target-date retirement portfolios were $66.9 billion, including $62.9 billion in the target-date retirement funds and $4.0 billion in the target-date retirement trusts.
Annual results for 2011 include net revenues of $2.7 billion, net income of $773.2 million, and diluted earnings per common share of $2.92, an increase of 15% from the $2.53 per share earned in 2010.
From an investment performance standpoint, 76% of the T. Rowe Price funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable Lipper averages on a total return basis for the three-year
 
period ended December 31, 2011, 86% outperformed for the five-year period, 77% outperformed for the 10-year period, and 60% outperformed for the one-year period. In addition, T. Rowe Price stock, bond and blended asset funds that ended the quarter with an overall rating of four or five stars from Morningstar account for 83% of the firm's rated funds' assets under management. The firm's asset allocation funds  which provide simplified investment and retirement planning solutions for many clients  continue to deliver very attractive long-term performance, with at least 86% of these funds outperforming their comparable Lipper averages on a total return basis for the three-, five-, and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2011.
Financial Highlights
Investment advisory revenues earned in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the U.S. were $391.2 million, an increase of $9.3 million, or 2%, from the comparable 2010 quarter. Average mutual fund assets under management in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $285.5 billion, an increase of nearly 5% from the average for the comparable 2010 quarter. Money market fees voluntarily waived by the firm to maintain positive yield for fund investors in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $10.4 million compared with $6.7 million in the comparable 2010 quarter. During 2011, the firm waived $36.4 million in such fees, compared to $25.1 million in the 2010 year.
Mutual fund assets at December 31, 2011 were $289.4 billion, an increase of $22.8 billion from September 30, 2011. Net inflows during the fourth quarter of 2011 were $2.2 billion, including $1.5 billion originating in the target-date retirement funds which are invested in other T. Rowe Price funds. Bond funds added $1.9 billion while the stock and blended asset funds added $.3 billion of net new flows, which includes the net inflows originating in the target-date retirement funds. Higher market valuations and income increased mutual fund assets under management by $20.6 billion during the fourth quarter of 2011.
Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios were $179.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the $178.6 million earned in the comparable 2010 quarter. Average assets in these portfolios were $199.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 4%, from the 2010 quarter. Ending assets in these portfolios were $200.1 billion, up $13.2 billion from September 30, 2011, as market appreciation and income of
 
$14.3 billion was offset by $1.1 billion in net outflows. Strong inflows from institutional investors into fixed income portfolios were offset by equity portfolio outflows as institutional investors continued to derisk their portfolios in the wake of the uncertain and volatile market environment. Investors domiciled outside the United States accounted for 11% of the firm's assets under management at December 31, 2011.
Although there is no impact on the firm's total assets under management, approximately $1.8 billion in assets were transferred from the firm's sponsored mutual funds in January 2012, to its other managed investment portfolios, primarily the target-date retirement trusts. The firm expects that additional transfers are likely to occur in the future.
Distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R and variable annuity class shares of the firm's sponsored portfolios were $20.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $8.1 million from the 2010 period. The increase in these 12b-1 fees is primarily a result of fees earned on the R class shares in the fourth quarter of 2011 for which the comparable 2010 quarterly revenue was netted against related distribution and servicing costs. These fees are entirely offset by the distribution and servicing costs paid to third-party financial intermediaries that source such shares.
Operating expenses were $378.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, up $13.3 million from the 2010 quarter due primarily to increases in distribution and servicing costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and compensation and related costs. At December 31, 2011, the firm employed 5,255 associates, up 4% from the 5,052 associates employed at the end of 2010.
Advertising and promotion expenditures were $25.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $24.7 million in the comparable 2010 period. The firm currently expects that its advertising and promotion expenditures for 2012 could increase modestly from 2011 levels. The firm varies its level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as its efforts to expand its investor base in the United States and abroad.
Other operating expenses were $57.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $59.4 million in the comparable 2010 period. A higher charitable contribution in 2011 made to
 
the T. Rowe Price Foundation and increases in other operating expenses incurred to meet growing business demands were more than offset by the non-recurrence of the $16.4 million contribution made to certain money market funds in the fourth quarter of 2010.
The 2011 annual provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 38.2%. The firm currently estimates its effective rate for 2012 will be about 37.7%.
T. Rowe Price remains debt-free with ample liquidity, including cash and mutual fund investment holdings of nearly $1.7 billion. During 2011, the firm expended $479.7 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares of its common stock and invested $82.3 million in capitalized technology and facilities. These cash expenditures were funded from available liquid resources. The firm is planning 2012 capital expenditures of about $100 million for property and equipment additions, which it expects to fund with operating resources.
Management Commentary
James A.C. Kennedy, the company's chief executive officer and president, commented: "With markets facing substantial headwinds, 2011 was an unusually volatile year that tested the patience of investors around the world. The eurozone's sovereign debt problems, lack of political leadership in both Washington and Europe, and concerns about a global economic slowdown led to losses in most global equity markets. Despite the tumult, a fragile U.S. economic recovery continued to gain traction, bond investors came through in relatively good shape, and investors in U.S. large-cap companies had small gains.
"For the firm, generally lackluster markets meant asset growth for the year was driven by net inflows. Our solid long-term relative investment performance and high client satisfaction helped attract incremental assets from existing and new clients. We are pleased that ending and annual average assets under management hit record highs for a year-end period. Accordingly, our annual net revenue, net income, and earnings per share also reached new highs.
"We continue to manage expenses carefully in this uncertain environment. However, our financial stability and strong operating cash flow allow us to continuously invest in key capabilities to meet clients' changing needs over the long-term. In 2011, we increased our
 
number of investment professionals around the globe, including building out our equity team in Australia, and hiring a head of fixed income solutions. We also expanded our investment offerings for individual and institutional investors; bolstered our sales, client service, consultant relations, and marketing teams around the world; and hired a new head of U.S. Third Party Distribution.
"As we begin 2012, most world markets have continued their positive momentum from the fourth quarter. However, the macro outlook remains clouded, especially by political and policy issues. Though caution is understandable, our teams are finding attractive long-term investment opportunities. We expect that European and U.S. leaders will eventually address their fiscal challenges, bolstering investor confidence. Moreover, U.S. corporate profit growth should continue, albeit at a slower pace. This, combined with attractive equity valuations, has historically been a good recipe for market gains."
In closing, Mr. Kennedy said: "2012 marks the 75th anniversary of our firm's founding, and while much has changed in that time, the principles and values that guide us have remained constant. Our long-term perspective, thorough research, and collaborative environment enable us to focus on doing what is right for the client. By staying true to our clients and stockholders, we are confident that the outlook for our company remains strong."
