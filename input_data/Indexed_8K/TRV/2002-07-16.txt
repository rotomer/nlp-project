Item 5. Other Events. ------------ In the first quarter of 2002, The St. Paul began implementing the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which established financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. The statement changed prior accounting requirements in the way intangible assets with useful lives, including goodwill, are tested for impairment on an annual basis. It also requires that those assets meeting the criteria for classification as intangible with estimable useful lives be amortized to expense over those lives, while intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill are not amortized. As a result of implementing the provisions of this statement, we will not record any goodwill amortization expense in 2002. The following table presents the impact, on a pro forma basis, of adopting SFAS No. 142 with respect to ceasing the amortization of goodwill, for the years ended Dec. 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Year Ended December 31, (In millions, except ------------------------------- per share amounts) 2001 2000 1999 ------------------ ------- ------ ------ Net income (loss): As reported $(1,088) $ 993 $ 834 Add: goodwill amortization 29 27 36 ----- ----- ----- Pro forma net income (loss) $(1,059) $1,020 $ 870 ===== ===== ===== Basic Earnings (Loss) per Share: As reported $ (5.22) $ 4.50 $ 3.61 Goodwill amortization 0.14 0.13 0.16 ----- ----- ----- Pro forma basic EPS $ (5.08) $ 4.63 $ 3.77 ===== ===== ===== Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share: As reported $ (5.22) $ 4.24 $ 3.41 Goodwill amortization 0.14 0.12 0.15 ----- ----- ----- Pro forma diluted EPS $ (5.08) $ 4.36 $ 3.56 ===== ===== =====
