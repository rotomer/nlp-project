Item 5. Other Events ------------ The following statement was derived from a press release of The St. Paul Companies, Inc. dated July 30, 2002 related to the impact of an oil rig surety ruling: The St. Paul Companies announced today that it believes the net third-quarter 2002 earnings impact from a July 26, 2002, federal court ruling should not exceed $25 million, net of reinsurance, case reserves and taxes, and prior to any recoveries. The company believes that the recoveries may be significant, but it cannot reasonably estimate them at this time. The company continues to review the ruling, rendered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The ruling involved claims against a subsidiary of The St. Paul and another surety in connection with the construction of two rigs for a Brazilian oil company.
