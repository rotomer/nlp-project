Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and (xv) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion for the Securities (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; such counsel has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the date of such opinion, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in lieu of the delivery of the opinion set forth in paragraph (iv) of this Section 7(c) as to The John Nuveen Company, such counsel may cause Alan G. Berkshire, Vice President and General Counsel to The John Nuveen Company, to deliver an opinion as to such matters, dated such Time of Delivery. Such counsel may also state that he has relied on the opinion or opinions delivered pursuant to Section 7(c) with respect to matters of New York law.

the date of the most recent report filed with the Commission containing financial statements and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, if the date of such report is later than such effective date, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively and, with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Underwriters may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters; (f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Principal Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than any decrease in the capital stock resulting from purchases under the Company's Stock Repurchase Program and any increase in the capital stock resulting from the exercise of stock options or the issuance of restricted shares under the Company's stock incentive and employee compensation plans, or the conversion of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock) or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relative to the Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Underwriters so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; (g) On or after the date of this Agreement (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) other than as disclosed in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, no such organization shall have publicly announced or otherwise given notice to the Company that it has under surveillance, review or watch, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability, or of any review for a possible change therein that does not indicate the direction of the possible change; (h) On or after the date of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or 18

(k) On or prior to the First Time of Delivery, the Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each executive officer of the Company addressed to the Underwriters. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact such Underwriter sold Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the Act if the Company has previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter and the loss, 19
claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus which was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented). (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 20
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of the Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same 21
terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, the Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Underwriters notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Underwriters that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Underwriters may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate stated amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate stated amount of the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the stated amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the stated amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate stated amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Option Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 22
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 11.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, as Trustee, By: ----------------------- Authorized Officer 3
(REVERSE OF SECURITY) THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. 5.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2007 This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 12, 2002 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a Board Resolution dated July 25, 2002, and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of this series and of the terms upon which such Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $442,750,000. The Securities of this series were initially issued as components of the Company's equity units that are in the form of corporate units (each, a "Corporate Unit"), each such Corporate Unit initially consisting of (a) a stock purchase contract (each, a "Purchase Contract") under which (i) the holder will agree to purchase from the Company on August 16, 2005, a specified number of newly issued shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company and (ii) the Company will pay to the holder quarterly contract adjustment payments and (b) $50 principal amount of the Securities of this series. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2002 (the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as purchase contract agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"), on their initial issuance the Securities of this series were pledged by the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Corporate Units, to BNY Midwest Trust Company, as collateral agent (the "Collateral Agent"), pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2002 (the "Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent, to secure such holders' obligations to purchase shares of the common stock of the Company under the Purchase Contracts. The interest rate on this Security shall be reset to the Reset Rate, effective as of the Reset Effective Date, in the event of a successful remarketing of the Securities of this series pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement (the "Remarketing Agreement") to be entered into among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact of the holders of Purchase Contracts, and a remarketing agent to be designated by the Company (the "Remarketing Agent"). Pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent shall use its reasonable best efforts to remarket the Securities of this series at a specified aggregate price on the third Business Day R-1
immediately preceding May 16, 2005, and, if the remarketing on such date is unsuccessful or has not occurred because a condition precedent thereto has not been fulfilled, on the third Business Day immediately preceding July 1, 2005, and, if the remarketing on such date is unsuccessful or has not occurred because a condition precedent thereto has not been fulfilled, on the third Business Day immediately preceding August 16, 2005. If a remarketing is successful, the Reset Rate shall be the interest rate at which the Securities of this series were successfully remarketed, and the Reset Effective Date shall be the third Business Day immediately following the date of such successful remarketing, which is also the date on which such remarketing shall settle. If a remarketing fails, the interest rate will not be reset at that time. In the event of a successful remarketing, the interest rate on this Security shall be reset at the Reset Rate as of the Reset Effective Date whether or not the Holder of this Security shall have participated in such remarketing. If a Tax Event (as defined below) occurs and is continuing, the Company may, upon not more than 60 or less than 30 days' notice by mail, at its option, redeem the Securities of this series, in whole, but not in part, at any time at the Redemption Amount (as defined below) for each such Security, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Security with respect to any Interest Payment Date on or prior to the date of redemption. If the Tax Event redemption occurs prior to May 16, 2005, or, if the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to May 16, 2005 is unsuccessful, but the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to July 1, 2005 is successful, prior to July 1, 2005 or if the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to July 1, 2005 is unsuccessful, prior to August 16, 2005, the Redemption Amount for Securities of this series forming a part of the Corporate Units will be distributed to the Collateral Agent, who in turn will purchase the Treasury portfolio described below on behalf of the holders of the Corporate Units of which the Securities of this series form a part and remit the remainder of the Redemption Amount, if any, to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the holders of such Corporate Units. The Treasury portfolio will be substituted for the Securities and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the Corporate Unit holders' obligations to purchase shares of common stock of the Company under the Purchase Contracts. "Tax Event" means the receipt by the Company of an opinion of nationally recognized independent tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest or original issue discount on the Securities of this series would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of any amendment to, change in, or announced proposed change in, the laws, or any regulations thereunder, of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, any amendment to or change in an interpretation or application of any such laws or regulations by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority or any interpretation or pronouncement that provides for a position with respect to any such laws or regulations that differs from the generally accepted position on July 25, 2002, which amendment, change or proposed change is effective or which interpretation or pronouncement is announced on or after July 25, 2002. R-2

Solely for purposes of determining the Treasury portfolio purchase price in the case of a Tax Event redemption date that occurs after August 15, 2005 or the earlier successful remarketing of the Securities of this series, "Treasury portfolio" shall mean a portfolio of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities consisting of principal or interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities which mature on or prior to August 15, 2007 in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series outstanding on the Tax Event redemption date and with respect to each scheduled Interest Payment Date on the Securities of this series that occurs after the Tax Event redemption date, interest or principal strips of U.S. Treasury securities which mature on or prior to such Interest Payment Date in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate interest payment that would be due on the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series outstanding on the Tax Event redemption date. "Redemption Amount" means for each Security of this series an amount in cash equal to (1) in the case of a Tax Event redemption occurring prior to May 16, 2005, or, if the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to May 16, 2005 shall be unsuccessful but the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to July 1, 2005 is successful, prior to July 1, 2005, or prior to August 16, 2005 if the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to July 1, 2005 shall be unsuccessful, the product of (a) the principal amount of such Security and (b) a fraction whose (i) numerator is the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price (as defined below) and whose (ii) denominator is the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series included in Corporate Units, and (2) in the case of a Tax Event redemption occurring on or after May 16, 2005 (if the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to May 16, 2005 is successful), or, if the remarketing on the third Business Day prior to July 1, 2005 shall be successful, on or after July 1, 2005, or on or after August 16, 2005 the product of (a) the principal amount of such Security and (b) a fraction whose (i) numerator is the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and (ii) whose denominator is the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series outstanding on the Tax Event redemption date. "Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price" means the lowest aggregate price quoted by a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City to the quotation agent (as defined below) on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Tax Event R-3
redemption date for the purchase of the Treasury portfolio for settlement on the tax event redemption date. "Quotation agent" means Merrill Lynch Government Securities, Inc. or its successor or any other primary U.S. government securities dealer in The City of New York (in the State of New York) selected by the Company. If the remarketing of the Securities of this series on the third Business Day prior to August 16, 2005 has occurred and has resulted in a failed remarketing, each Holder of Securities of this series shall have the right (the "Put Option") to put such Securities to the Company, on August 16, 2005, or if such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (the "Put Option Settlement Date") at a repayment price equal to the principal amount of such Securities plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of payment. In order for a Holder to exercise the Put Option, the Trustee must receive, on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Put Option Settlement Date, at its Corporate Trust Office, or at an office or agency maintained by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York as contemplated by Section 1002 of the Indenture, the Securities of this series to be repurchased with the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of or otherwise accompanying such Securities duly completed. Any such notice received by the Trustee shall be irrevocable. All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of the Securities of this series for repayment shall be determined by the Company, whose determination shall be final and binding. Holders of Securities of this series will be notified not later than seven nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding August 16, 2005 of the procedures that must be followed if such Holders wish to exercise their Put Option. If the Put Option is exercised, the payment of the repayment price in respect of this Security shall be made no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Put Option Settlement Date. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, an amount of principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the majority of the Holders in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of R-4
this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium, and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

Any certificate or opinion of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless the Company knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Agent and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and (subject to Section 7.1 hereof) conclusive in favor of the Agent and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section 1.4. (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner which the Agent deems sufficient.

thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Certificate. (e) The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of the outstanding Corporate Units and the outstanding Treasury Units, as the case may be, on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action with respect to the Corporate Units or the Treasury Units, as the case may be, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Securities on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Securities on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Agent in writing and to each Holder of Securities in the manner set forth in Section 1.6 hereof. With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 1.4, the Company may designate any date as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the Agent in writing, and to each Holder of Securities in the manner set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 1.4, the Company shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date. Section 1.5 Notices.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Agent, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Agent shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

In any case where the Payment Date shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporate Unit Certificates or the Treasury Unit Certificates), the Contract Adjustment Payment shall not be made on such date, but shall be made on the immediately following Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Payment Date, provided that no interest shall accrue or be payable by the Company or to any Holder for the period from and after any such Payment Date unless there shall be a default in the payment due on such next succeeding Business Day. -19-

No failure on the part of the Company, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. ARTICLE II CERTIFICATE FORMS Section 2.1 Forms of Certificates Generally.

Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of such Certificates. No Purchase Contract evidenced by a Certificate shall be valid until such Certificate has been executed on behalf of the Holder by the manual signature of an authorized signatory of the Agent, as such Holder's attorney-in-fact. Such signature by an authorized signatory of the Agent shall be conclusive evidence that the Holder of such Certificate has entered into the Purchase Contracts evidenced by such Certificate.

The Agent shall keep at the Corporate Trust Office a register (the "Corporate Units Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Agent shall provide for the registration of Corporate Unit Certificates and of transfers of Corporate Unit Certificates (the Agent, in such capacity, the "Corporate Units Registrar") and a register (the "Treasury Units Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Agent shall provide for the registration of Treasury Unit Certificates and of transfers of Treasury Unit Certificates (the Agent, in such capacity, the "Treasury Units Registrar").

Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver the Certificates that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate shall evidence the ownership of the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same obligations, under this Agreement as the Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Sections 3.4, 3.6, 3.9 and 8.5 hereof not involving any transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver, any Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section 3.5 and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Agent shall (i) if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date has occurred, deliver (or request the Company to deliver) the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Securities evidenced by such Certificate (together with any cash or other property to which the Holder is entitled), or (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Purchase -24-
Contract Settlement Date, transfer the Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article V hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no transfer by any Holder to any Person other than the Company of any Corporate Unit, Treasury Unit or Note may be made or will be recognized unless such instrument has been surrendered and accepted for registration of transfer in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.5, or unless such transfer is effectuated through the book-entry system described in Section 3.6 hereof. Section 3.6 Book-Entry Interests. The Certificates, on original issuance, will be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Certificates, to be delivered to the Depositary by, or on behalf of, the Company. Such Global Certificate shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Company in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Certificate representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Global Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.9 hereof. The Agent shall enter into an agreement with the Depositary if so requested by the Company. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 3.9 hereof: (a) the provisions of this Section 3.6 hereof shall be in full force and effect; (b) the Company and the Agent shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Agreement (including receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Securities and the sole holder of the Global Certificate(s) and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners; (c) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.6 hereof conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 3.6 hereof shall control; and (d) the rights of the Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. The Clearing Agency will make book entry transfers among Clearing Agency Participants. Section 3.7 Notices to Holders. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Holders is required to be given under this Agreement, the Company or the Agent shall give such notices and communications to the Holders and, with respect to any Securities registered in the name of a Clearing Agency or the nominee of a Clearing Agency, the Company or the Agent shall, except as set forth herein, have no obligations to the Beneficial Owners. -25-

If any Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Securities, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Clearing Agency with respect to the Securities. Section 3.9 Definitive Certificates. If (i) a Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Securities and a successor Clearing Agency is not appointed within 90 days after such discontinuance pursuant to Section 3.8 hereof or (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a default by the Company in respect of its obligations under one or more Purchase Contracts, or the Indenture, then upon surrender of the Global Certificates representing the Book-Entry Interests with respect to the Securities by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. Section 3.10 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Certificates. If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate at the cost of the Holder, evidencing the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity at the cost of the Holder as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Agent that such Certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, a Certificate on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section 3.10 and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Agent shall (i) if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date has occurred, deliver (or request the Company to deliver) the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Securities evidenced by such Certificate (together with any cash or other property to which the Holder is entitled), or (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, transfer the Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article V hereof. -26-
Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.10, the Company and the Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Agent) connected therewith. Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.10 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Security evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate (and the Securities evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder. The provisions of this Section 3.10 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. Section 3.11 Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered as the owner of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units evidenced thereby, for the purpose of (subject to any applicable Record Date) receiving interest on the Notes or on the maturing quarterly interest strips of the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (if any), for the performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any interest on the Notes shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company nor the Agent, nor any agent of the Company or the Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Agent or any agent of the Company or the Agent, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any Clearing Agency (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Certificate or impair, as between such Clearing Agency and owners of beneficial interests in such Global Certificate, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of such Clearing Agency (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Certificate. None of the Company, the Agent nor any agent of the Company or the Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Certificate or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Section 3.12 Cancellation. All Certificates surrendered for delivery of shares of Common Stock on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, upon the transfer of Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, after the occurrence of a Termination Event or pursuant to an Early Settlement, or upon the registration of a transfer or exchange of a Security, or a Collateral Substitution or the reestablishment of a Corporate Unit or Treasury Unit shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Agent, be delivered to the Agent and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Agent for -27-
cancellation any Certificates previously authenticated, executed and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon Issuer Order, be promptly cancelled by the Agent. No Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Certificates cancelled as provided in this Section 3.12, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All cancelled Certificates held by the Agent shall be disposed of by the Agent in its customary manner. If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate is delivered to the Agent cancelled or for cancellation. Section 3.13 Establishment of Treasury Units. Subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder may separate the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, from the related Purchase Contracts in respect of a Corporate Unit by substituting for such Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount of such Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable (a "Collateral Substitution"), at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in the case of the Notes and on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in the case of the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, in each case by (a) depositing with the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes comprising part of such Corporate Units or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio comprising part of such Corporate Unit, as the case may be, and (b) transferring the related Corporate Units to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Treasury Securities to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such Corporate Units, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may not separate the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, from the related Purchase Contracts in respect of the Corporate Units held by such Holder during the period commencing on the fourth Business Day immediately prior to the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, prior to the Secondary Remarketing Date) and ending on the fourth Business Day following the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, following the Secondary Remarketing Date). Upon receipt of the Treasury Securities described in clause (a) above and the instruction described in clause (b) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, having the appropriate aggregate principal amount in the case of such Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Corporate Units; -28-
(ii) transfer the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Treasury Unit Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 hereof evidencing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Corporate Units. Holders who elect to separate the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, from the related Purchase Contract and to substitute Treasury Securities for such Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent in respect of the substitution, and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees or expenses. Holders may make Collateral Substitutions (i) only in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units if Treasury Securities are being substituted for the Notes, or (ii) only in integral multiples of 32,000 Corporate Units if Treasury Securities are being substituted for the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio. In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.13 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Corporate Units or fails to deliver a Corporate Unit Certificate(s) to the Agent after depositing Treasury Securities with the Collateral Agent, the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, constituting a part of such Corporate Units, and any interest on such Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Corporate Units are so transferred or the Corporate Unit Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to a Corporate Unit Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Agent that such Corporate Unit Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. Except as described in this Section 3.13, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Corporate Unit remains in effect, such Corporate Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder in respect of the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and Purchase Contract comprising such Corporate Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Corporate Unit. Section 3.14 Reestablishment of Corporate Units. Subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder of a Treasury Unit may recreate Corporate Units at any time (i) prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has not occurred, and (ii) on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred and an Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, in each case by (a) depositing with the Collateral Agent Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, having an aggregate principal amount in the case of the Notes, or -29-
an appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Treasury Securities comprising part of the Treasury Units and (b) transferring the related Treasury Units to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Treasury Securities underlying such Treasury Units, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may not reestablish Corporate Units during the period commencing on the fourth Business Day immediately prior the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, prior to the Secondary Remarketing Date) and ending on the fourth Business Day following the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, following the Secondary Remarketing Date). Upon receipt of the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, described in clause (a) above and the instruction described in clause (b) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, the Treasury Securities having a corresponding aggregate principal amount from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Treasury Units; (ii) transfer the Treasury Securities to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Corporate Unit Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 hereof evidencing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Treasury Units. Holders who elect to reestablish Corporate Units shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of the reestablishment and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees. Holders of Treasury Units may reestablish Corporate Units in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units for the same multiple of 20 Corporate Units if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has not occurred, and in integral multiples of 32,000 Treasury Units for 32,000 Corporate Units if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred. In the event a Holder re-establishing Corporate Units pursuant to this Section 3.14 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Treasury Units or fails to deliver a Treasury Unit Certificate(s) to the Agent after depositing Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, with the Collateral Agent, the Treasury Securities constituting a part of such Treasury Units shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Treasury Units are so transferred or the Treasury Unit Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to a Treasury Unit Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Agent that such Treasury Unit Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. Except as provided in this Section 3.14, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts and -30-
the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and Purchase Contract comprising such Treasury Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Treasury Unit. Section 3.15 Transfer of Collateral upon Occurrence of Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event and the transfer to the Agent of the Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying the Corporate Units and the Treasury Units pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent shall request transfer instructions with respect to such Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from each Holder by written request mailed to such Holder at its address as it appears in the Corporate Units Register or the Treasury Units Register, as the case may be. Upon book-entry transfer of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units or delivery of a Corporate Unit Certificate or a Treasury Unit Certificate to the Agent with such transfer instructions, the Agent shall transfer the Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying such Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, to such Holder by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with such instructions; provided that, to the extent that a Holder of Corporate Units or Treasury Units would otherwise be entitled to receive less than $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, the Agent shall dispose of such securities for cash, and transfer the appropriate amount of such cash to such Holder in accordance with such Holder's instructions. In the event a Holder of Corporate Units or Treasury Units fails to effect such transfer or delivery, the Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying such Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and any distributions thereon, shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Corporate Units or Treasury Units are transferred or the Corporate Unit Certificate or Treasury Unit Certificate is surrendered or such Holder provides satisfactory evidence that such Corporate Unit Certificate or Treasury Unit Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. Section 3.16 No Consent to Assumption. Each Holder of a Security, by acceptance thereof, shall be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the Purchase Contract by the Company, receiver, liquidator or a Person performing similar functions, its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. Section 3.17 CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Agent shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Agent of any changes in the "CUSIP" numbers. -31-
ARTICLE IV THE NOTES AND APPLICABLE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO Section 4.1 Interest and Other Payments; Rights to Payments Preserved; Rate Reset; Notice. Any distribution on any Note or on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, which is made on any Payment Date shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Agent from the Indenture Trustee or from the Collateral Agent as provided by the terms of the Pledge Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name the Corporate Unit Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Corporate Unit Certificates) of which such Note or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, is a part is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Each Corporate Unit Certificate evidencing Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Corporate Unit Certificate shall carry the rights to accrued and unpaid distributions, and other amounts that are to accrue, which were or will be carried by the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio underlying such other Corporate Unit Certificate. In the case of any Corporate Units with respect to which Cash Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date pursuant to prior notice, or with respect to which Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution is effected, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, interest on the Notes or distributions on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such Corporate Units otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Cash Settlement or Early Settlement or Collateral Substitution, and such distributions shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Corporate Unit Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) was registered at the close of business on the Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Corporate Units with respect to which Cash Settlement or Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or an Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution has been effected, distributions on the related Notes or on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, that would otherwise be payable after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such Corporate Units; provided that to the extent that such Holder continues to hold the separated Notes that formerly comprised a part of such Holder's Corporate Units, such Holder shall be entitled to receive any payments made on such separated Notes. The applicable Coupon Rate on the Notes on and after May 16, 2005 will be reset on the Initial Remarketing Date to the applicable Reset Rate (such Reset Rate to be in effect on and after May 16, 2005), except in the event of a Failed Initial Remarketing. In the event of a Failed Initial Remarketing, the applicable Coupon Rate on the Notes outstanding on and after July 1, 2005 will be reset -32-
on the Secondary Remarketing Date to the applicable Reset Rate (such Reset Rate to be in effect on and after July 1, 2005), except in the event of a Failed Secondary Remarketing. In the event of a Failed Secondary Remarketing, the applicable Coupon Rate on the Notes outstanding on and after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date will be reset on the Final Remarketing Date to the applicable Reset Rate (such Reset Rate to be in effect on and after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date), except in the event of a Failed Final Remarketing. On the applicable Reset Announcement Date, the Reset Spread and the Two-Year Benchmark Treasury, Two and One-Quarter Benchmark Treasury or Two and One-Eighth Benchmark Treasury, as applicable, to be used to determine the Reset Rate will be announced by the Company. On the Business Day immediately following the Reset Announcement Date, the Holders of Notes will be notified of such Reset Spread and Two-Year Benchmark Treasury, Two and One-Quarter Benchmark Treasury or Two and One-Eighth Benchmark Treasury, as applicable, by the Company. Such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Notes if published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York. Not later than seven calendar days nor more than fifteen calendar days prior to the Reset Announcement Date, the Company will notify DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to notify the Beneficial Owners or Clearing Agency Participants holding Corporate Units or Treasury Units of such Reset Announcement Date and, in the case of a Final Remarketing, the procedures to be followed by Holders of Corporate Units who intend to settle their obligation under the Purchase Contract with separate cash on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Section 4.2 Notice and Voting. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Notes pledged with the Collateral Agent but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of Corporate Units a notice (prepared by the Company) (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Notes underlying their Corporate Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Corporate Units on such record date, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Corporate Unit, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Notes underlying such Corporate Units. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Corporate Units to timely instruct the Agent in order to enable the Agent to vote such Notes. Section 4.3 Tax Event Redemption. Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to May 16, 2005, or, in the event of a Failed Initial Remarketing but a Successful Secondary Remarketing prior to July 1, 2005 or, in the event of a Failed Secondary Remarketing, prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount for the Notes that are components of Corporate Units, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes with respect to any Interest Payment Date on or prior to the date of redemption, to -33-
purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such Redemption Amount to the Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the pledged Notes, and will be held by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of a Corporate Unit to purchase the Common Stock of the Company under the Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Corporate Units. Following the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to May 16, 2005 or, in the event of a Failed Initial Remarketing but a Successful Secondary Remarketing, prior to July 1, 2005 or, in the event of a Failed Secondary Remarketing, prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Note shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Unit Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Treasury Portfolio for Notes as collateral. Section 4.4 CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Indenture Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Indenture Trustee and the Agent of any changes in the "CUSIP" numbers. ARTICLE V THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS Section 5.1 Purchase of Shares of Common Stock. Each Purchase Contract shall obligate the Holder of the related Security to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount (the "Purchase Price"), a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate unless an Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with Section 5.7(b)(2) or Section 5.10 hereof, or, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Security of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $29.04 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.7218 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, which is equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Threshold Appreciation Price, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $24.20 (the "Reference Price"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Reference Price, 2.0661 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.7 (and -34-
in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). As provided in Section 5.11 hereof, no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts. The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on (a) the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or (b) for purposes of determining cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in connection with an Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.11 hereof, the third Trading Day immediately preceding the relevant Early Settlement Date or (c) for the purposes of clause (2) of Section 5.7(b) the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on any such date; or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last closing sale price of the Common Stock as reported by the Nasdaq National Market; or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or, if such bid price is not available, the Closing Price means the market value of the Common Stock on the date determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. Each Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit, by its acceptance thereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contract on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder), agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, and consents to the provisions hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to and agrees to be bound by the Pledge of the Notes, the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; provided that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Security under the Purchase Contract may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. Each Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.5 hereof and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, Proceeds of the Treasury Securities, the Notes or the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such Proceeds. Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee) by the terms of this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying the Certificates so transferred -35-
and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. Section 5.2 Contract Adjustment Payments. (a) Subject to Section 5.3 herein, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date in such coin or currency of the United States as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payments. The Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the New York Office maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Corporate Units Register or the Treasury Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by a prior written notice by such Person. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), if any, shall cease. Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the re-establishment of a Corporate Unit) any other Certificate shall carry the rights to Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued and unpaid (including any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), and to accrue Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, which were carried by the Purchase Contracts underlying such other Certificates. Subject to Section 5.7(b)(2) and Section 5.10 hereof, in the case of any Security with respect to which Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date, or in respect of which Cash Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution or an establishment or re-establishment of Corporate Units pursuant to Section 3.14 hereof is effected, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying such Securities otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Cash Settlement, Early Settlement, Collateral Substitution or establishment or re-establishment of Corporate Units, and such Contract Adjustment Payments shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Security (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Security with respect to which Cash Settlement or Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or on an Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution or an establishment or re-establishment of Corporate Units has been effected, Contract Adjustment Payments, if any (including any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), that would otherwise be payable after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date, Collateral Substitution or such establishment or re-establishment with respect to such Purchase Contract shall not be payable. -36-
(b) The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness. (c) In the event (x) of any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, or (y) subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(e) below, that (i) a default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the payment of principal, interest or any other monetary amounts due and payable on any Senior Indebtedness and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Senior Indebtedness (and the Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), or (ii) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness shall have been accelerated because of a default in respect of such Senior Indebtedness (and the Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), then: (i) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive, in the case of clause (x) above, payment in full of all amounts due or to become due upon all Senior Indebtedness and, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (y) above, payment of all amounts due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the Securities are entitled to receive any Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Securities; (ii) any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of any of the Securities would be entitled except for the provisions of Sections 5.2(b) through (n), including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Securities, shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the Holders of such Securities; and (iii) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts -37-
underlying the Securities, shall be received by the Agent or the Holders of any of the Securities when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Sections 5.2(b) through (n), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. (d) For purposes of Sections 5.2(b) through (n), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Sections 5.2(b) through (n) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Securities to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; provided that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. (e) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Senior Indebtedness, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Sections 5.2(b) through (d) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, and (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review. (f) Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Securities is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Securities shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Sections 5.2(b) through (n) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Sections 5.2(b) through (n) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand. -38-
(g) Nothing contained in Sections 5.2(b) through (n) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under these Sections 5.2(b) through (n), of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. (h) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in these Sections 5.2(b) through (n), the Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or agent or other person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to these Sections 5.2(b) through (n). (i) The Agent shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Sections 5.2(b) through (n), the Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Sections 5.2(b) through (n), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. (j) Nothing contained in Sections 5.2(b) through (n) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments, except as otherwise provided in these Sections 5.2(b) through (n). (k) Each Holder of Securities, by his acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Agent on his, her or its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Sections 5.2(b) through (n) and appoints the Agent his, her or its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes. (l) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Agent in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.2(b) through (n) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Agent, unless and until the Agent shall have received written notice thereof mailed or delivered to a Responsible Officer of the Agent from the -39-
Company, any Holder, any paying agent or the holder or representative of any Senior Indebtedness; provided that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section 5.2, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date. (m) The Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section 5.2 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Agent of any of its rights as such holder. (n) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. (o) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof. With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, (i) the duties and obligations of the Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Agent shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Agent; and (iv) the Agent shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders. Section 5.3 Deferral of Payment Dates for Contract Adjustment Payments. (a) The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer such payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Securities, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 9% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounded quarterly up to but not including each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments accrued thereon, being referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments") . Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section 5.3. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Purchase Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Holder's right to receive Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments will terminate. -40-
(b) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. (c) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, each Holder will receive on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in lieu of a cash payment a number of shares of Common Stock (in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate) equal to (x) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder divided by (y) the Applicable Market Value. (d) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued by the Company with respect to the payment of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable with respect to such payment of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, the Holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share times the Applicable Market Value as provided in Section 5.11 hereof. (e) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock other than: (i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers or directors or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for another class or series of the Company's capital stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Company (or rights to acquire capital stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of capital stock in exchange for or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale of the Company's capital stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's capital stock); (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; or -41-
(vi) mandatory sinking fund payments with respect to any series of preferred stock of the Company; provided that the aggregate stated value of all such series outstanding at the time of such payment does not exceed 5% of the aggregate value of (1) the total principal amount of all then outstanding bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness issued or assumed by the Company and (2) the Company's capital and surplus to be stated on the Company's books of account after giving effect to such payment; provided that any moneys deposited in to any sinking fund and not in violation of this clause (vi) may thereafter be applied to the purchase or redemption of such preferred stock in accordance with the terms of such sinking fund without regard to the foregoing restrictions. Section 5.4 Initial Remarketing and Secondary Remarketing. (a) Unless a Tax Event Redemption has occurred, the Company shall engage a nationally recognized investment bank (the "Remarketing Agent") pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement to sell the Notes (the "Initial Remarketing") on the third Business Day immediately preceding May 16, 2005 (the "Initial Remarketing Date"). In order to facilitate the remarketing, the Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be remarketed that are part of Corporate Units. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, or the Custodial Agent, pursuant to clause (c) below, will present for remarketing such Notes (and the Separate Notes that are to be remarketed pursuant to clause (c) below) to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Initial Remarketing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to remarket such Notes on such date at a price of 100.5% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100.5% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price (a "Successful Initial Remarketing"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Initial Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. In addition, the Remarketing Agent may deduct as a remarketing fee ("Remarketing Fee") an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price. With respect to Separate Notes, any proceeds of the Initial Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee or attributable to the Separate Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the Holders of Separate Notes. With respect to Notes that are part of Corporate Units, any proceeds in excess of those required to pay the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Notes will be remitted to the Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. A Corporate Unit Holder whose Notes are so remarketed will not otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Notes of Holders of Corporate Units and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the Corporate Unit Holders' obligation to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Initial Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Notes shall be -42-
deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Unit Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Treasury Portfolio for Notes as collateral. If, (i) despite using its reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the related Notes (other than to the Company) at a price equal to or greater than 100.5% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price, or (ii) the Initial Remarketing has not occurred because of a condition precedent to the remarketing has not been fulfilled, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "Failed Initial Remarketing"). The Company will cause a notice of a Failed Initial Remarketing to be published on the second Business Day immediately preceding May 16, 2005 in an Authorized Newspaper. The Notes will continue to be a component of Corporate Units, and another remarketing may be attempted as described in Section 5.4(b) (b) In the event of a Failed Initial Remarketing and unless a Tax Event Redemption has occurred, the Company shall engage the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement to sell the Notes (the "Secondary Remarketing") on the third Business Day immediately preceding July 1, 2005 (the "Secondary Remarketing Date"). In order to facilitate the remarketing, the Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Secondary Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be remarketed that are part of Corporate Units. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, or the Custodial Agent, pursuant to clause (c) below, will present for remarketing such Notes (and the Separate Notes that are to be remarketed pursuant to clause (c) below) to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Secondary Remarketing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to remarket such Notes on such date at a price of 100.5% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100.5% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price (a "Successful Secondary Remarketing"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Secondary Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. In addition, the Remarketing Agent may deduct as the Remarketing Fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Price. With respect to Separate Notes, any proceeds of the Secondary Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing or attributable to the Separate Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the Holders of Separate Notes. With respect to Notes that are part of Corporate Units, any proceeds in excess of those required to pay the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Notes will be remitted to the Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. A Corporate Unit Holder whose Notes are so remarketed will not otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Notes of Holders of Corporate Units and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the Corporate Unit Holders' obligation to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Secondary Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Notes -43-
shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Unit Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Treasury Portfolio for Notes as collateral. If, (i) despite using its reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the related Notes (other than to the Company) at a price equal to or greater than 100.5% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price, or (ii) the Secondary Remarketing has not occurred because of a condition precedent to the remarketing has not been fulfilled, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "Failed Secondary Remarketing"). The Company will cause a notice of a Failed Secondary Remarketing to be published on the second Business Day immediately preceding July 1, 2005 in an Authorized Newspaper. The Notes will continue to be a component of Corporate Units, and another remarketing may be attempted as described in Section 5.5(b). (c) A Holder of a Note that is no longer part of a Corporate Unit may elect to have such Note remarketed in the Initial Remarketing and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Secondary Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Notes to the Custodial Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date or the Secondary Remarketing Date, as applicable, of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Notes that are to be remarketed. Any such notice will be irrevocable and may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date or Secondary Remarketing Date, as applicable, the Custodial Agent shall cause such Separate Notes to be presented to the Remarketing Agent for the Initial Remarketing or the Secondary Remarketing, as the case may be. (d) Not later than seven calendar days nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the Initial Remarketing Date and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Secondary Remarketing Date, the Company shall notify the Agent and shall request that the Clearing Agency notify the Beneficial Owners or Clearing Agency participants holding securities of the procedures followed in the Initial Remarketing or the Secondary Remarketing, as the case may be. (e) If required by applicable law, the Company agrees to endeavor to ensure that a registration statement with regard to the full amount of the Notes to be remarketed in the Initial Remarketing and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Secondary Remarketing shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a form that will enable the Remarketing Agent to rely on it in connection with the Initial Remarketing and the Secondary Remarketing. Section 5.5 Payment of Purchase Price, Cash Settlement, Final Remarketing. (a) (i) Unless a Tax Event Redemption, Successful Initial Remarketing, Successful Secondary Remarketing, Termination Event or Early Settlement has occurred, each Holder of a Corporate Unit may pay in cash ("Cash Settlement") the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to a Purchase Contract if such Holder notifies the Agent by use of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto of its intention to make a Cash Settlement. Such notice shall be made on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. The Agent shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent of the receipt of such a notice from a Holder intending to make a Cash Settlement. -44-
(ii) A Holder of a Corporate Unit who has so notified the Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement is required to pay the Purchase Price to the Collateral Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer, in each case payable to or upon the order of the Company. Any cash received by the Collateral Agent will be invested promptly by the Collateral Agent in Permitted Investments and paid to the Company on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in settlement of the Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any funds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the investment earnings from the investment in such Permitted Investments will be distributed to the Agent when received for payment to the Holder. (iii) If a Holder of a Corporate Unit fails to notify the Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with clause (i) above, such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the pledged Notes pursuant to the Final Remarketing as described in Section 5.5(b) below. If a Holder of a Corporate Unit does notify the Agent as provided in clause (i) above of its intention to pay the Purchase Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by clause (ii) above, such failure shall constitute a default; however, the Notes of such a Holder will not be remarketed but instead the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Notes, including but not limited to those rights specified in Section 5.5(d) below. (b) (i) Unless a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred, the Notes of Corporate Unit Holders who have not notified the Agent of their intention to effect a Cash Settlement as provided in clause (i) of Section 5.5(a) and the Separate Notes that are to be remarketed pursuant to clause (ii) below will be sold by the Remarketing Agent (the "Final Remarketing") on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (the "Final Remarketing Date"). The Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Final Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that are part of Corporate Units to be remarketed. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, or the Custodial Agent pursuant to clause (ii) below, will present for remarketing such Notes to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Agent and such Notes (and the Separate Notes that are to be remarketed pursuant to clause (ii) below) from the Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Final Remarketing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to remarket such Notes on such date at a price of 100.5% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Notes plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price (a "Successful Final Remarketing"), the Remarketing Agent will remit the entire amount of the proceeds from such Successful Final Remarketing to the Collateral Agent; provided that the Remarketing Agent may deduct as the Remarketing Fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the remarketed Notes plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price from any amount of the proceeds of a Successful Final Remarketing in excess of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of -45-
the remarketed Notes plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price. The portion of the entire proceeds which is equal to the aggregate principal amount of the remarketed Notes will automatically be applied by the Collateral Agent, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, to satisfy in full such Corporate Unit Holders' obligations to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. With respect to the Separate Notes, any proceeds of the Final Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee or attributable to the Separate Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the Holders of Separate Notes. With respect to Notes that are part of Corporate Units, any proceeds in excess of those required to pay the Purchase Price for the Purchase Contracts related to such Corporate Units and the Remarketing Fee will be remitted to the Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. A Corporate Unit Holder whose Notes are so remarketed will not otherwise be responsible with respect to such Notes for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. If, (i) despite using its reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes plus the Separate Notes Purchase Price, or (ii) the remarketing has not occurred because of a condition precedent to the remarketing has not been fulfilled, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "Failed Final Remarketing") and the holder of the Notes will have a right to put the Notes to the Company as described in clause (c) below or, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Notes, including those actions specified in clause (d) below. The Company will cause a notice of such Failed Final Remarketing to be published on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in an Authorized Newspaper. (ii) A Holder of a Note that is no longer part of a Corporate Unit may elect to have such Note remarketed in the Final Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Notes to the Custodial Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Final Remarketing Date of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that are not part of Corporate Units to be remarketed. Any such notice will be irrevocable and may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Final Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent shall cause such Notes to be presented to the Remarketing Agent for Final Remarketing. (iii) Not later than seven calendar days nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the Final Remarketing Date, the Company shall notify the Agent, and shall request that the Clearing Agency notify the Beneficial Owners or Clearing Agency participants holding securities of the procedures to be followed in the Final Remarketing. (iv) If required by applicable law, the Company agrees to endeavor to ensure that a registration statement with regard to the full amount of the Notes to be remarketed in the Final Remarketing shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a form that will enable the Remarketing Agent to rely on it in connection with the Remarketing. -46-
(c) If a Failed Final Remarketing has occurred, each holder of the Notes shall have the right ("Put Option") to put such Notes to the Company on August 16, 2005, or if such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (the "Put Option Settlement Date") at a repayment price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of payment. To exercise the Put Option, the Indenture Trustee must receive from the holder of the Notes, on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Put Option Settlement Date, at its Corporate Trust Office, or at an office or agency maintained by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York as contemplated by Section 1002 of the Indenture, the Notes to be repurchased with the form on the reverse of or otherwise accompanying such Notes duly completed. Any such notice received by the Indenture Trustee shall be irrevocable. All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of the Notes for repayment shall be determined by the Company, whose determination shall be final and binding. Holders of Notes will be notified not later than seven nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding August 16, 2005 of the procedures that must be followed if such holders wish to exercise their Put Option. The payment of the repayment price in respect of the Notes shall be made no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Put Option Settlement Date. If a Holder has exercised the Put Option but has not otherwise settled the Purchase Contracts in cash by the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the put price will be applied by the Collateral Agent, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, to satisfy in full the obligations of the Holder to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. (d) With respect to any Notes beneficially owned by Holders who have elected Cash Settlement but failed to deliver cash as required in clause (a)(ii) above, or with respect to Notes which are subject to a Failed Final Remarketing, and for which the Put Option was not exercised, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and clause (i) below, may, among other things, permit the Company to (i) retain and cancel the Notes or (ii) cause the Notes to be sold in one or more public or private sales, in either case, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts. (e) Unless a Termination Event or an Early Settlement has occurred, the Purchase Contract underlying each Treasury Unit and, if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred, each Corporate Unit will be settled with the Proceeds at maturity of the Treasury Security or the Applicable Ownership Interest (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable. Upon receipt of such Proceeds, the Collateral Agent will invest the Proceeds promptly in Permitted Investments and pay the Proceeds to the Company on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any such Proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in excess of the Purchase Price and any funds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the investment earnings from the investment in such Permitted Investments will be distributed to the Agent when received for payment to the Holders. (f) Any distribution to Holders of excess funds and interest described above, shall be payable at the New York Office maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Register, or, at the option of the Company, by wire transfer to the bank account designated by such Holders in writing, such payments to be made to the same Persons entitled to receive Common Stock with respect to the Purchase Contracts referred to in clause (d) above. -47-
(g) Unless a Holder settles the underlying Purchase Contract through Early Settlement in the manner described in Section 5.10 hereof, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificate therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in this Section 5.5. (h) Upon Cash Settlement of any Purchase Contract, (i) the Collateral Agent will in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement cause the pledged Notes underlying the relevant Security to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent free and clear of any security interest of the Company and transferred to the Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee as soon as practicable and (ii) subject to the receipt thereof from the Collateral Agent, the Agent shall, by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with instructions provided by the Holder thereof, transfer such Notes (or, if no such instructions are given to the Agent by the Holder, the Agent shall hold such Notes and any distributions thereon in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder pending receipt of such instructions). (i) The obligations of the Holders to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and are payable solely out of any Cash Settlement or the Proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between the Proceeds of Collateral and the Purchase Price. Section 5.6 Issuance of Shares of Common Stock. Unless a Termination Event or an Early Settlement shall have occurred, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, upon the Company's receipt of payment in full of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holders pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article and subject to Sections 5.7(b) and 5.11 hereof, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities, one or more certificates representing newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which both a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Contract Settlement Fund") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Agent on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article V (after taking into account all Securities then held by such Holder) together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.11 hereof and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered, no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. -48-
Section 5.7 Adjustment of Settlement Rate. (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc. (1) In case the Company shall pay or make a stock dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and (ii) the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this clause (1), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any share certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not pay any stock dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (2) In case the Company shall issue rights, options or warrants, other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan, to all holders of its Common Stock (not being available on an equivalent basis to Holders of the Securities upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Securities) entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan), the Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price and (ii) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For purposes of this clause (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any share certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (3) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may -49-
be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (4) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other property (but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in clause (2) of this Section 5.7(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, and any dividend or distribution referred to in clause (1) of this Section 5.7(a)), the Settlement Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution filed with the Agent) on such date of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and (ii) the denominator shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this clause (4) is applicable, clauses (1) and (2) of this Section 5.7(a) shall not be applicable. (5) In case the Company shall, (I) by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding (i) regular quarterly cash distributions, (ii) any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.7(b) applies or (iii) cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (4) of this Section 5.7(a)) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (II) the aggregate amount of any other distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash (excluding regular quarterly cash distributions) within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this clause (5) or clause (6) of this Section 5.7(a) has been made and (III) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value, as of the expiration of the applicable tender or exchange offer referred to below (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), of consideration payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of the distribution described in clause (I) above and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this clause (5) or clause (6) of this Section 5.7(a) has been made, exceeds 5% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, the Settlement Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the combined amount distributed or payable in the transactions described in clauses (I), (II) and (III) above and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date for determination and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal -50-
to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination. (6) In case (I) a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) that combined together with (II) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer) by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to clause (5) of this Section 5.7(a) or this clause (6) has been made and (III) the aggregate amount of any distributions (other than regular quarterly cash distributions) to all holders of the Company's Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to clause (5) of this Section 5.7(a) or this clause (6) has been made, exceeds 5% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time, then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Settlement Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Settlement Rate immediately prior to the close of business as of the Expiration Time by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to (A) the product of (i) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the Expiration Time and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less (B) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the transactions described in clauses (I), (II) and (III) above (assuming in the case of clause (I) the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the Expiration Time and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares"). (7) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.7(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of clause (4) of this Section 5.7(a)), and (b) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of -51-
such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of clause (3) of this Section 5.7(a)). (8) The "Current Market Price" per share of Common Stock on any day means the average of the daily Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days selected by the Company commencing not more than 30 Trading Days before, and ending not later than, the earlier of the day in question and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation. For purposes of this clause (8), the term "ex date", when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. (9) All adjustments to the Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; provided that any adjustments which by reason of this clause are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. If an adjustment is made to the Settlement Rate pursuant to clause (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of this Section 5.7(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.1 will apply on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to clause (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of this Section 5.7(a) and the denominator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately before such adjustment; provided that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by clause (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) or (10) of this Section 5.7(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. (10) The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 5.7(a), it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of capital stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for capital stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons. (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. (1) In the event of: (i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation), (ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, -52-
(iii) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any such event described in clauses (i) to (iv) above, a "Reorganization Event"), the Settlement Rate will be adjusted to provide that each Holder of Securities will receive on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date with respect to each Purchase Contract forming a part thereof (or upon any Early Settlement pursuant to clause (2) of Section 5.7(b)), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Reorganization Event. The adjustment described in the preceding sentence shall apply only to a Holder of Common Stock who is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the purpose of this Section 5.7(b) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by the non-electing shares). In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires or leases the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holders of each Outstanding Security shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.7. Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.7(b). The above provisions of this Section 5.7(b) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. (2) In the event of a consolidation or merger in which (i) the Company merges with or into another Person, (ii) there is any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (iii) 30% or more of the total consideration paid to the Company's shareholders for the outstanding shares of Common Stock consists of cash or cash equivalents (a "Cash Merger"), then a Holder of a Security may settle his Purchase Contract for cash in the manner described in Section 5.10 hereof, mutatis mutandis, at the applicable Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the Cash Merger. -53-
Within five Business Days after the date of the consummation of a Cash Merger (the "Cash Merger Date"), the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Securities of such consummation (the "Cash Merger Notice"), which shall specify the deadline for submitting a notice of Early Settlement pursuant to this clause (2), the applicable Early Settlement Date, the applicable Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the Cash Merger and the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder upon settlement of each Purchase Contract as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(1). In this clause (2), the tenth Business Day after the date the Cash Merger Notice is provided to the Holders by the Company shall be the applicable Early Settlement Date and the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early and the related cash payment of the Purchase Price shall be 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the ninth Business Day after the date the Cash Merger Notice is provided to the Holders by the Company. Treasury Unit Holders may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this clause (2) in integral multiples of 20 Purchase Contracts. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.1 shall apply with respect to an Early Settlement following a Cash Merger pursuant to this clause (2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this clause (2) unless, at the time such Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective registration statement with respect to the securities to be delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a registration statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for either the Company or the Agent) under the Securities Act. If such a registration statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have in effect a registration statement covering the securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (B) provide a prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that the Agent may deliver to the applicable Holders in connection with such Early Settlement. (c) All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Agent shall have no responsibility with respect thereto. Section 5.8 Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events. (a) Whenever the Settlement Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall: (i) forthwith compute the Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.7 hereof and prepare and transmit to the Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and (ii) within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.7 hereof (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide a written notice to the Holders of the Securities of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Settlement Rate. -54-
(b) The Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to the Company any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract; and the Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Section 5.9 Termination Event; Notice. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Securities shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forming a part of such Securities in the case of Corporate Units, or Treasury Securities in the case of Treasury Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 of the Pledge Agreement; provided that, to the extent that a Holder of Corporate Units or Treasury Units would otherwise be entitled to receive less than $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, the Agent shall dispose of such securities for cash, and transfer the appropriate amount of such cash to such Holder in accordance with such Holder's written instructions. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Register. -55-
Section 5.10 Early Settlement. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.10, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Securities having an aggregate Stated Amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof may effect early settlement ("Early Settlement") on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Holders of Treasury Units may only effect Early Settlement of the related Purchase Contracts in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units, and if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, Purchase Contracts underlying the Securities may only be settled in integral multiples of 32,000 Corporate Units. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Securities shall deliver to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office or at the New York Office an "Election to Settle Early" form (on the reverse side of the Certificate) and any other documents requested by the Agent and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount (the "Early Settlement Amount") equal to the product of (i) (A) the Stated Amount times (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (ii) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and subject to Section 5.1 hereof, no payment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract on account of any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Purchase Contract or on account of dividends payable on the Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement, the record date for which payment occurs prior to the Early Settlement Date. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying any Securities prior to or at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day, such day shall be the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Securities and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Securities shall be the next succeeding Business Day (so long as such next succeeding Business Day is not later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) (b) No Early Settlement will be permitted under this Section 5.10 unless, at the time of delivery of the Election to Settle Early form or the time the Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective registration statement with respect to the shares of Common Stock to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a registration statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for either the Company or the Agent) under the Securities Act. If such a registration statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have in effect a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (B) provide a prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that the Agent may use in connection with such Early Settlement. (c) Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Securities, except in the case of Early Settlement following a Cash Merger as described in Section 5.7(b)(2), the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive 1.7218 shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract as to which Early Settlement is effected (the "Early -56-
Settlement Rate"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted. (d) Not later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date, the Company shall cause: (i) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.11 hereof; and (ii) the related Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of Corporate Units, or the related Treasury Securities, in the case of Treasury Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. (e) Upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of shares of Common Stock from the Company and the Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from the Securities Intermediary, as applicable, the Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the Election to Settle Early form (on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Securities) (i) transfer to the Holder the Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming a part of such Securities; (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.11 hereof; and (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, deliver a prospectus for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement as contemplated by Section 5.10(b). (f) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the Securities evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement the Company shall execute and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Securities as to which Early Settlement was not effected. -57-
Section 5.11 No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one Purchase Contract shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or upon Early Settlement, the Company, through the Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to the value of such fractional shares times the Applicable Market Value. The Company shall provide the Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.11 in a timely manner. Section 5.12 Charges and Taxes. The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the initial issuance and delivery of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Contracts and in payment of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments; provided that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a Security or any issuance of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the Securities evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such share certificates or Certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid or that no such tax is due. ARTICLE VI REMEDIES Section 6.1 Unconditional Right of Holders to Purchase Common Stock. The Holder of any Corporate Units or Treasury Units shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, (A) subject to the right of the Company to defer payment thereof pursuant to Section 5.3 hereof, and to the forfeiture of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments upon Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.10(a) hereof or upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, to receive payment of each installment of the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, with respect to the Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Security on the respective Payment Date for such Security, and (B) to purchase Common Stock pursuant to such Purchase Contract and, in each such case, to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and right to purchase Common Stock, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. -58-
Section 6.2 Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company and such Holder shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. Section 6.3 Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates in the last paragraph of Section 3.10 hereof, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. Section 6.4 Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy upon a default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such right. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Holders. Section 6.5 Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Agreement agree, and each Holder of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, by its acceptance of such Corporate Units or Treasury Units shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Agreement, or in any suit against the Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Agent, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Agent, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% of the Outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of interest on any Notes on or after the respective Payment Date therefor in respect of any Security held by such Holder, or for enforcement of the right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Contracts constituting part of any Security held by such Holder. -59-
Section 6.6 Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Agreement; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Agent or the Holders, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

(Form of Reverse of Corporate Unit Certificate) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2002 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Corporate Unit Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. In the case of any inconsistency between this Certificate and the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement shall prevail. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Corporate Unit Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Purchase Price, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement with respect to the Security of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $29.04 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.7218 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $24.20, (the "Reference Price"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Reference Price, 2.0661 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby which is settled either through Early Settlement (other than an Early Settlement following a Cash Merger pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(2) of the Purchase Contract Agreement) or Cash Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Corporate Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate or the Settlement Rate, as the case may be. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby which is settled through Early Settlement following a Cash Merger pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(2) of the Purchase Agreement shall obligate the Holder of the related Corporate Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the Cash Merger (as such Settlement Rate may be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(1) of the Purchase Contract Agreement). The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on (a) the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or (b) for purposes of determining cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in connection with an Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.11 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the third Trading Day immediately preceding the relevant Early Settlement Date or (c) for the purposes of clause (2) of Section 5.7(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on any such date; or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional A-5
securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last closing sale price of the Common Stock as reported by the Nasdaq National Market; or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or, if such bid price is not available, the Closing Price means the market value of the Common Stock on the date determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Corporate Unit Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement or an Early Settlement or from the Proceeds of a remarketing of the related pledged Notes of such Holder or of the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio. Unless a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred, a Holder of Corporate Units who does not elect to make an effective (1) Cash Settlement on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (2) Early Settlement on or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contract from the Proceeds of the sale of the related pledged Notes held by the Collateral Agent. Unless a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred, such sale will be made by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement and any supplemental remarketing agreement executed in connection therewith between the parties thereto, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred, a Holder of Corporate Units who does not elect to make an effective Early Settlement on or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date shall pay the Purchase Price with the Proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interest (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio. If, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, (i) upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing (unless the Holder of this Certificate has exercised the Put Option or elected Cash Settlement) or (ii) if a Holder notifies the Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement but fails to deliver the purchase price in cash on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, exercises its rights as a secured creditor with respect to the pledged Notes related to this Corporate Unit Certificate, any accrued and unpaid interest on such pledged Notes will become payable by the Company to the Holder of the Corporate Unit Certificate in the manner provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the pledged Notes. Upon receipt of notice of any A-6
meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Corporate Unit Holders a notice (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each Corporate Unit Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Notes constituting a part of such holder's Corporate Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Corporate Unit Holders on such record date, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Corporate Unit, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Notes evidenced by such Corporate Units. Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount for the Notes that are components of Corporate Units to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such Redemption Amount, if any to the Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. Upon the occurrence of a Successful Initial Remarketing or Successful Secondary Remarketing, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent will apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio, and, after deducting the Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, promptly remit the remaining portion of such Proceeds of the Successful Initial Remarketing or Successful Secondary Remarketing to the Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. Following the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or following a Successful Initial Remarketing or Successful Secondary Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on the Treasury Portfolio. Upon the occurrence of a Successful Final Remarketing, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent will remit the entire amount of the proceeds from such Successful Final Remarketing to the Collateral Agent after deducting the Remarketing Fee. The portion of the entire proceeds which is equal to the aggregate principal amount of the remarketed Notes will automatically be applied by the Collateral Agent, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, to satisfy in full the obligations of the Holder of this Corporate Unit to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. With respect to Notes that are part of Corporate Units, any proceeds in excess of those required to pay the Purchase Price for the Purchase Contracts related to such Corporate Units and the Remarketing Fee will be remitted to the Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. A Holder of this Corporate Unit whose Notes are so remarketed will not otherwise be responsible with respect to such Notes for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. A-7
Following the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, the holder of the Notes will have a Put Option with regard to the Notes, and, if that Put Option is not exercised by the Holders, the Company will, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, at its election, (a) direct the Collateral Agent to dispose of such Holder's Notes in accordance with applicable law or (b) the Company will either retain and cancel the Notes or cause the Notes to be sold in one or more public or private sales, in either case, in full satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts. The Company will cause a notice of such Failed Final Remarketing to be published on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in an Authorized Newspaper. If a Holder of this Certificate has exercised the Put Option but has not otherwise settled the Purchase Contracts in cash by the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the put price will be applied by the Collateral Agent, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, to satisfy in full the obligations of the Holder to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. The Corporate Unit Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Corporate Unit Certificate will be registered and Corporate Unit Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Corporate Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute Treasury Securities for Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Corporate Unit remains in effect, such Corporate Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Unit in respect of Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the Purchase Contract constituting such Corporate Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Corporate Unit. A Holder of a Corporate Unit may create a Treasury Unit at any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date by delivering to the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the pledged Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, in exchange for the release of such pledged Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Security for which such pledged Treasury Securities secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Treasury Unit". A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution at any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units for the same multiple of 20 Treasury Units; provided that if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder may make such Collateral Substitutions at any time prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in integral multiples of 32,000 Corporate Units for the same multiple of 32,000 Treasury Units. A-8
A Holder of Treasury Units may recreate Corporate Units at any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date by delivering to the Collateral Agent Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, with an aggregate principal amount, in the case of such Notes, or with the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of such appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, equal to the aggregate principal amount of the pledged Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of such pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any such recreation of a Corporate Unit may be effected at any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in multiples of 20 Treasury Units for the same multiple of 20 Corporate Units; provided that if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder may make such substitution at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in integral multiples of 32,000 Treasury Units for the same multiple of 32,000 Corporate Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of Corporate Units may not create Treasury Units and a Holder of Treasury Units may not recreate Corporate Units during the period commencing on the fourth Business Day immediately prior to the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, prior to the Secondary Remarketing Date) and ending on the fourth Business Day following the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, following the Secondary Remarketing Date). Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Corporate Unit Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Agent and the New York Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Corporate Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing. The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer such payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 9% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounded quarterly on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, may be deferred to a date that is on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the A-9
registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, on the Purchase Contracts until the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Holder of this Corporate Unit Certificate will receive on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, in lieu of a cash payment, a number of shares of Common Stock (in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate) equal to (x) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder of this Corporate Unit Certificate divided by (y) the Applicable Market Value. In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any capital stock of the Company other than: (i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers or directors or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date of such event; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for another class or series of the Company's capital stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Company (or rights to acquire capital stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the Company); (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; or (vi) mandatory sinking fund payments with respect to any series of preferred stock of the Company; provided that the aggregate stated value of all such series outstanding at the time of such payment does not exceed 5% of the aggregate of (1) the total principal amount of all then outstanding bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness issued or assumed by the Company and (2) the Company's capital and surplus to be stated on the Company's books of account after giving effect to such payment; provided that any moneys deposited into any sinking fund and not in violation of this clause (vi) may thereafter be applied to the purchase or redemption of such preferred stock in accordance with the terms of such sinking fund without regard to the foregoing restrictions. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Corporate Units Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Notes or the appropriate Applicable A-10
Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Securities may be settled early ("Early Settlement") as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Corporate Unit Certificate, the Holder of this Corporate Unit Certificate shall deliver to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office an Election to Settle Early form set forth below and any other documents requested by the Agent duly completed and accompanied by payment in the form of immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company in an amount (the "Early Settlement Amount") equal to (i) the product of (A) $50 and (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (ii) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date for any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts. Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Securities, the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such Securities shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to 1.7218 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract (the "Early Settlement Rate"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Corporate Unit Certificate in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement) under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Corporate Unit Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. The Holder of this Corporate Unit Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby on his behalf as his attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying this Corporate Unit Certificate pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and to all other provisions of the Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, Proceeds of the pledged Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date shall be paid by the Collateral A-11
Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such Proceeds. The Holder of this Corporate Unit Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, agrees to treat itself as owner of the related Notes or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and to treat the Notes as indebtedness for all tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts then outstanding. The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Corporate Unit Certificate is registered as the owner of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest payable quarterly on the Notes or on the maturing quarterly interest strips of the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Each Treasury Unit represents (i) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Treasury Security having a principal amount at maturity equal to $1,000, subject to the Pledge of such Treasury Security by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (ii) the rights and obligations of the Holder under one Purchase Contract with The St. Paul Companies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company", which term, as used herein, includes its successors pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement). All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement have the meaning set forth therein. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Treasury Securities constituting part of each Treasury Unit evidenced hereby have been pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligations of the Holder under the Purchase Contract comprising a portion of such Treasury Units. The Pledge Agreement provides that all payments of the principal of any Treasury Securities received by the Collateral Agent shall be paid by the Collateral Agent by wire transfer in same day funds (i) in the case of any principal payments with respect to any Treasury Securities that have been released from the Pledge pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, to the Holders of the applicable Treasury Units to the accounts designated by them in writing for such purpose no later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day such payment is received by the Collateral Agent (provided that in the - ------------------ * To be inserted in Global Certificates only B-1

Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Treasury Unit Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on August 16, 2005 (the "Purchase Contract Settlement Date"), at a price equal to $50 (the "Stated Amount"), a number of newly issued shares of class A common stock, without par value ("Common Stock"), of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement with respect to the Treasury Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part, all as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof.

The Company shall pay on each Payment Date in respect of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Treasury Unit evidenced hereby an amount (the "Contract Adjustment Payments") equal to 3.75% per year of the Stated Amount, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, subject to deferral at the option of the Company as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof. Such Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the Person in whose name this Treasury Unit Certificate (or a Predecessor Treasury Unit Certificate) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date.

(Form of Reverse of Treasury Unit Certificate) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2002 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Treasury Unit Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. In the case of any inconsistency between this Certificate and the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement shall prevail. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Treasury Unit Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at the Purchase Price, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement with respect to the Security of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $29.04 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.7218 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $24.20 (the "Reference Price"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Reference Price, 2.0661 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby which is settled through Early Settlement (other than an Early Settlement following a Cash Merger pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(2) of the Purchase Contract Agreement) shall obligate the Holder of the related Treasury Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby which is settled through Early Settlement following a Cash Merger pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(2) of the Purchase Agreement shall obligate the Holder of the related Treasury Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the Cash Merger (as such Settlement Rate may be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(1) of the Purchase Contract Agreement). The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on (a) the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or (b) for purposes of determining cash payable in lieu of fractional shares in connection with an Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.11 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the third Trading Day immediately preceding the relevant Early Settlement Date or (c) for the purposes of clause (2) of Section 5.7(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the B-4
last closing sales price on and as reported as reported by the Nasdaq National Market or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the Closing Price means the market value of the Common Stock on the date determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Treasury Unit Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting either an Early Settlement of each such Purchase Contract or by applying a principal amount of the pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Holder's Treasury Units equal to the Stated Amount to the purchase of the Common Stock. A Holder of Treasury Units who does not elect, on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to make an Early Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued on the related Purchase Contract by applying a principal amount of the pledged Treasury Securities as aforesaid. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. The Treasury Unit Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Treasury Unit Certificate will be registered and Treasury Unit Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Treasury Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract constituting such Treasury Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Treasury Unit. A Holder of Treasury Units may recreate Corporate Units at any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date by delivering to the Collateral Agent Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, with an aggregate principal amount, in the case of such Notes, or with the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of such appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, equal to the aggregate principal amount of the pledged Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of such pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such substitution, the Security for which such pledged Notes or appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, secures the Holder's B-5
obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Corporate Unit". A Holder may make such a substitution at any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units for the same multiple of 20 Corporate Units; provided that if a Tax Event Redemption, Successful Initial Remarketing or Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder may make such substitution at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in integral multiples of 32,000 Treasury Units for the same multiple of 32,000 Corporate Units. A Holder of a Corporate Unit may create a Treasury Unit any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date by delivering to the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount of the pledged Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, in exchange for the release of such pledged Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any such creation of a Treasury Unit may be effected at any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in multiples of 20 Corporate Units for the same multiple of 20 Treasury Units; provided if a Tax Event Redemption or a Successful Initial Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, a Holder may make such Collateral Substitution at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and only in integral multiples of 32,000 Corporate Units for the same multiple of 32,000 Treasury Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of Corporate Units may not create Treasury Units and a Holder of Treasury Units may not recreate Corporate Units during the period commencing on the fourth Business Day immediately prior to the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, prior to the Secondary Remarketing Date) and ending on the fourth Business Day following the Initial Remarketing Date (and, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, following the Second Remarketing Date). Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Treasury Unit Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Agent and the New York Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Treasury Units Register. The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer such payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 9% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30 day months), compounded quarterly on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the B-6
Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, may be deferred to a date that is on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, on the Purchase Contracts until the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Holder of this Treasury Unit Certificate will receive on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, in lieu of a cash payment, a number of shares of Common Stock (in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate) equal to (x) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder of this Treasury Unit Certificate divided by (y) the Applicable Market Value. In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any capital stock of the Company other than: (i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers or directors or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date of such event; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for another class or series of the Company's capital stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Company (or rights to acquire capital stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the Company) ; (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; or (vi) mandatory sinking fund payments with respect to any series of preferred stock of the Company; provided that the aggregate stated value of all such series outstanding at the time of such payment does not exceed 5% of the aggregate of (1) the total principal amount of all then outstanding bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness issued or assumed by the Company and (2) the Company's capital and surplus to be stated on the Company's books of account after giving effect to such payment; provided that any moneys deposited into any sinking fund and not in violation of this clause (vi) may thereafter be applied to the purchase or redemption of such preferred stock in accordance with the terms of such sinking fund without regard to the foregoing restrictions.

In 9
the event the Securities Intermediary receives from the Holders or the Purchase Contract Agent Entitlement Orders that conflict with Entitlement Orders received from the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary shall follow the Entitlement Orders received from the Collateral Agent. Such instructions and Entitlement Orders may, without limitation, direct the Securities Intermediary to transfer, redeem, sell, liquidate, assign, deliver or otherwise dispose of the Notes, the Treasury Securities, any Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, and any Security Entitlements with respect thereto and to pay and deliver any income, proceeds or other funds derived therefrom to the Company.

The Collateral Agent shall be the agent of the Company and shall act only as directed in writing by the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall issue Entitlement Orders to the Securities Intermediary when and as directed by the Company. (b) The Collateral Agent hereby confirms and agrees that: (i) all securities or other property underlying any Financial Assets credited to the Collateral Account shall be registered in the name of the Collateral Agent, indorsed to the Collateral Agent or in blank or credited to another securities account maintained in the name of the Collateral Agent and in no case will any Financial Asset credited to the Collateral Account be registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company or any Holder, payable to the order of, or specially indorsed to, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company or any Holder except to the extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to the Collateral Agent or in blank; (ii) all property delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Pledge Agreement (including, without limitation, any Notes, Treasury Securities or any Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio) will be promptly credited on the books of the Securities Intermediary to the Collateral Account; (iii) the Collateral Account is an account to which Financial Assets are or may be credited, and the Securities Intermediary shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, treat the Collateral Agent as entitled to exercise the rights of any Financial Asset credited to the Collateral Account; (iv) the Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any 10
other person relating to the Collateral Account and/or any Financial Assets credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with Entitlement Orders of such other person; and (v) the Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with the Company, any Holder or the Purchase Contract Agent purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to comply with Entitlement Orders as set forth in this Section 2.2 hereof. (c) The Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that each item of property (whether investment property, financial asset, security, instrument or Cash) credited to the Collateral Account shall be treated as a Financial Asset. (d) In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. (e) The Purchase Contract Agent hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent and the Company, with full power of substitution, as the Purchase Contract Agent's attorneys-in-fact to take on behalf of, and in the name, place and stead of, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders, any action necessary or desirable to perfect and to keep perfected the security interest in the Collateral referred to in Section 2.1 hereof. The grant of such power-of-attorney shall not be deemed to require of the Collateral Agent any specific duties or obligations not otherwise assumed by the Collateral Agent hereunder, it being hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to file or record any documents in any jurisdiction for purposes of perfecting or maintaining the security interest in the Collateral except those that it shall be directed in writing to execute by the Company. ARTICLE III DISTRIBUTIONS ON PLEDGED COLLATERAL So long as the Purchase Contract Agent is the registered owner of the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, it shall receive all payments thereon. If the Pledged Notes are reregistered, such that the Collateral Agent becomes the registered holder, all payments of principal on the Pledged Notes or, if applicable, the Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio, or interest payments on the Pledged Notes or on the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and all payments of the principal of, or cash distributions on, any Pledged Treasury Securities received by the Collateral Agent that are properly payable hereunder, shall be paid by the Collateral Agent by wire transfer in same day funds: 11

All payments received by the Purchase Contract Agent as provided herein shall be applied by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchase Contract Agent shall receive any payments of the principal amount of the Notes or, if applicable, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of 12
such term) or any amounts referred to in Section 4.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement on account of any Pledged Note or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, or a Holder of Treasury Units shall receive any payments of principal on account of any Treasury Securities that, at the time of such payment, are Pledged Treasury Securities, the Purchase Contract Agent or such Holder shall hold the same as trustee of an express trust for the benefit of the Company or, in the case of amounts referred to in Section 4.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, for the benefit of the Collateral Agent for and on behalf of the Company (and promptly deliver the same over to the Company or the Collateral Agent, as applicable) for application to the obligations of the Holders under the related Purchase Contracts, and the Holders shall acquire no right, title or interest in any such payments of principal, or other amounts referred to in this Section, so received. ARTICLE IV SUBSTITUTION, RELEASE, REPLEDGE AND SETTLEMENT OF NOTES Section 4.1 Substitution for Notes and the Creation of Treasury Units. At any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred), a Holder of Corporate Units shall have the right to create Treasury Units by substituting Treasury Securities for the Pledged Notes (or, if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred, the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio) securing such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts comprising a part of its Corporate Units in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units by (a) Transferring to the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities having a Value equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Notes (or appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be), to be released and (b) transferring the related Corporate Units to the Purchase Contract Agent, accompanied by a notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, to the Purchase Contract Agent stating that such Holder has Transferred the relevant Treasury Securities to the Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (a) above (stating the Value of the Treasury Securities Transferred by such Holder) and requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release from the Pledge the Pledged Notes or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, related to such Corporate Units. The Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent pursuant to the form provided in Exhibit A; provided that if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, Holders of Corporate Units may make such substitution only in integral multiples of 32,000 Corporate Units at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. 13
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of Corporate Units may not create Treasury Units by substituting the Treasury Securities for the Pledged Notes pursuant to this Section 4.1 during the period commencing on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date (or, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Secondary Remarketing Date) and continuing through the fourth Business Day following the Initial Remarketing Date (or, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, following the Secondary Remarketing Date). Without limiting the generality of any other provision herein, in no event shall the Collateral Agent have any liability for acting in accordance with instructions in the form provided in Exhibit A. Upon receipt of Treasury Securities from a Holder of Corporate Units and the related instruction from the Purchase Contract Agent and, if applicable, notice from the Company that a Successful Initial Remarketing, a Successful Secondary Remarketing or a Tax Event Redemption has occurred, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Notes or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and shall promptly Transfer to the securities account specified by the Purchase Contract Agent such Pledged Notes or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, free and clear of any lien, pledge or security interest created hereby. All items Transferred and/or substituted by any Holder pursuant to this Section 4.1, Section 4.2 or any other Section of this Agreement shall be Transferred and/or substituted free and clear of all liens, security interests, claims and encumbrances. Section 4.2 Substitution of Treasury Securities and the Recreation of Corporate Units. At any time prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred), a Holder of Treasury Units shall have the right to recreate Corporate Units in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units by (a) Transferring to the Collateral Agent Notes having a Value equal to the Value of the Pledged Treasury Securities to be released (or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio with the Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) having Value equal to the Value of the Pledged Treasury Securities to be released) and (b) delivering the related Treasury Units to the Purchase Contract Agent, accompanied by a notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, to the Purchase Contract Agent stating that such Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Notes (or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest of the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be) to the Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (a) above and requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release from the Pledge the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Treasury Units. The Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent in the form provided in Exhibit A; provided that if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred and the Treasury Portfolio has become a component of the Corporate Units, Holders of Treasury Units may make such substitution only in integral multiples of 32,000 Treasury Units, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a 14
Holder of Treasury Units may not recreate Corporate Units pursuant to this Section 4.2 during the period commencing on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date (or, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Secondary Remarketing Date) and continuing through the fourth Business Day following the Initial Remarketing Date (or, upon a failed Initial Remarketing, the Secondary Remarketing Date). Without limiting the generality of any other provision herein, in no event shall the Collateral Agent have any liability for acting in accordance with instructions in the form provided in Exhibit A. Upon receipt of the Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, from such Holder and the instruction from the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent shall release the Treasury Securities having a corresponding aggregate principal amount from the Pledge and shall promptly Transfer such Treasury Securities, free and clear of any lien, pledge or security interest created hereby, to the Purchase Contract Agent. Section 4.3 Termination Event. Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of written notice from the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent that there has occurred a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release all Collateral from the Pledge and shall promptly Transfer any Pledged Notes (or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio if the Company has notified the Collateral Agent that a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred) and Pledged Treasury Securities to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Corporate Units and the Treasury Units, respectively, free and clear of any lien, pledge or security interest or other interest created hereby. If such Termination Event shall result from the Company's becoming a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, and if the Collateral Agent shall for any reason fail promptly to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Pledged Notes, the Treasury Portfolio or of the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, as provided by this Section 4.3, the Purchase Contract Agent shall: (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion of a nationally recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent to the effect that, as a result of the Company's being the debtor in such a bankruptcy case, the Collateral Agent will not be prohibited from releasing or Transferring the Collateral as provided in this Section 4.3, and shall deliver such opinion to the Collateral Agent within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event, and if (y) the Purchase Contract Agent shall be unable to obtain such opinion within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event or (z) the Collateral Agent shall continue, after delivery of such opinion, to refuse to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Pledged Notes, the Pledged Applicable Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 4.3, then the Purchase Contract Agent shall within fifteen days after the occurrence of such Termination Event commence an action or proceeding in the court with jurisdiction of the Company's case under 15
the Bankruptcy Code seeking an order requiring the Collateral Agent to effectuate the release and transfer of all Pledged Notes, the Pledged Applicable Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, as provided by this Section 4.3 or (ii) commence an action or proceeding like that described above within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event. Section 4.4 Cash Settlement; Put Option. (a) Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of (i) a notice from the Purchase Contract Agent promptly after the receipt by the Purchase Contract Agent of notice that a Holder of Corporate Units has elected, in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 5.5(a)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, to settle its Purchase Contract with Cash and (ii) payment of the Purchase Price by such Holder on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Company, then the Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the Company, promptly invest any Cash received from a Holder in connection with a Cash Settlement in Permitted Investments. Upon receipt of the proceeds upon the maturity of the Permitted Investments on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall pay the portion of such proceeds and deliver any certified or cashiers' checks received and any funds so wired, in an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price, to the Company on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, and shall distribute any funds in respect of the interest earned from the Permitted Investments to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the relevant Holders. (b) If a Failed Final Remarketing has occurred, each Holder of Notes shall have a Put Option, as described in Section 5.5(c) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, giving each Holder the right to put the Notes to the Company on the Put Option Settlement Date at a repayment price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of payment. If a Holder has exercised the Put Option but has not otherwise settled the Purchase Contracts in cash by the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the put price will be applied by the Collateral Agent, in accordance with the terms hereof, to satisfy in full the obligations of the Holder to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. (c) Unless a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred, if a Holder of Corporate Units fails to notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with Section 5.5(a)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, such failure shall constitute an event of default under the Purchase Contract Agreement and hereunder, and the Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Notes pursuant to the remarketing as described in Section 5.5(b) of the Purchase Contract 16
Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference. If a Holder of Corporate Units does notify the Purchase Contract Agent as provided in Section 5.5(a)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement of its intention to pay the Purchase Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by Section 5.5(a)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Pledged Notes of such a Holder will not be remarketed but instead the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Pledged Notes at the direction of the Company to retain or dispose of the Collateral in accordance with applicable law. In addition, in the event of a Failed Final Remarketing as described in Section 5.5(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, unless such Holder shall have duly exercised its Put Option, such Failed Final Remarketing shall constitute an additional event of default hereunder by such Holder and the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will also exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Pledged Notes at the direction of the Company to retain or dispose of the Collateral in accordance with applicable law. Section 4.5 Early Settlement. Upon written notice to the Collateral Agent by the Purchase Contract Agent that one or more Holders of Securities have elected to effect Early Settlement of their respective obligations under the Purchase Contracts forming a part of such Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement (setting forth the number of such Purchase Contracts as to which such Holders have elected to effect Early Settlement), and that the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holders, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amounts pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement and that all conditions to such Early Settlement have been satisfied, then the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (a) Pledged Notes or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (b) Pledged Treasury Securities in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, as the case may be, in each case with an aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, equal to the product of (i) the Stated Amount times (ii) the number of such Purchase Contracts as to which such Holders have elected to effect Early Settlement and shall Transfer all such Pledged Notes, the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, free and clear of the Pledge created hereby, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of such Holders. Section 4.6 Application of Proceeds; Settlement. (a) In the event a Holder of Corporate Units (unless a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred) has not elected to make an effective Cash Settlement by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent (with a copy to the Collateral Agent) in the manner provided for in Section 5.5(a)(i) in the Purchase Contract Agreement and has not made an Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying its Corporate Units, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Purchase Contracts from the Proceeds of the related Pledged Notes. The Collateral Agent shall, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement 17
Date, without any instruction from such Holder of Corporate Units, present the related Pledged Notes to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing. Upon receiving such Pledged Notes, the Remarketing Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement and the Supplemental Remarketing Agreement (if any), will use its reasonable best efforts to remarket such Pledged Notes on the Final Remarketing Date at a price of 100.5% of the aggregate Value of such Pledged Notes, provided that such remarketing will not be considered to have failed so long as the Remarketing Agent obtains at least 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Pledged Notes on the Final Remarketing Date. After deducting as the Remarketing Fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the aggregate Value of the remarketed Pledged Notes from any amount of such Proceeds in excess of the aggregate Value of the remarketed Pledged Notes, the Remarketing Agent will remit the entire amount of the Proceeds of such remarketing to the Collateral Agent. On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company that portion of the Proceeds from such remarketing equal to the aggregate Value of such remarketed Pledged Notes to satisfy in full the obligations of such Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Purchase Price to purchase the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts. The remaining portion of such Proceeds, if any, shall be remitted by the Collateral Agent to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to such Holders of Corporate Units. If the Remarketing Agent advises the Collateral Agent in writing that it cannot remarket the related Pledged Notes of such Holders of Corporate Units at a price not less than 100% of the aggregate Value of such Pledged Notes or if the remarketing shall not have occurred because a condition precedent to the remarketing shall not have been fulfilled, thus resulting in a Failed Final Remarketing and an event of default under the Purchase Contract Agreement and hereunder, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company will, at the written direction of the Company, retain or dispose of the Pledged Notes in accordance with applicable law and satisfy in full, from any such disposition or retention, such Holder's obligation to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts. (b) In the event a Holder of Treasury Units or Corporate Units (if a Tax Event Redemption, a Successful Initial Remarketing or a Successful Secondary Remarketing has occurred) has not made an Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying its Treasury Units or Corporate Units, as the case may be, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Purchase Contracts from the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be. On the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the Purchase Contract Agent, which written direction shall be furnished to the Collateral Agent prior to 11:30 a.m., New York City time, invest the Cash proceeds of the maturing Pledged Treasury Securities or the maturing appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, in Permitted Investments; provided that if the Collateral Agent shall not receive any written direction by 11:30 a.m. New York City time, on such date, the Collateral 18
Agent shall invest such proceeds in Permitted Investments of the type specified in clause (v) of the definition of Permitted Investments. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder of Treasury Units or Corporate Units, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company that portion of the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio equal to the aggregate Purchase Price of such Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from the related Pledged Treasury Securities or appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the investment earnings from the investment in Permitted Investments is in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchase Contracts being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent shall remit such excess, when received, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders. (c) Pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement and subject to the terms of the Supplemental Remarketing Agreement (if any), on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date, the Secondary Remarketing Date or the Final Remarketing Date, as applicable, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding such date, holders of Separate Notes may elect to have their Separate Notes remarketed by delivering their Separate Notes, together with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, to the Custodial Agent. The Custodial Agent shall hold such Separate Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account. A holder of Separate Notes electing to have its Separate Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw such election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date, the Secondary Remarketing Date or the Final Remarketing Date, as applicable, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Notes to such holder. On the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date, the Secondary Remarketing Date or the Final Remarketing Date, as applicable, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Notes to be remarketed and will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all Separate Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to this Section 4.6(c) and not withdrawn pursuant to the terms hereof prior to such date. After deducting the Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent the remaining portion of the proceeds for the benefit of such holders. In the event of a Failed Initial Remarketing, a Failed Secondary Remarketing or a Failed Final Remarketing, as applicable, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Separate Notes to the Custodial Agent for redelivery to such holders. 19
ARTICLE V VOTING RIGHTS - NOTES The Purchase Contract Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement; provided that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or, as the case may be, shall not refrain from exercising such right if, in the judgment of the Company, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of the Pledged Notes, and provided, further, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Notes, including notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Purchase Contract Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefor from the Purchase Contract Agent, execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Notes (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Purchase Contract Agent with respect to the Pledged Notes. 20

(a) In addition to the rights and remedies specified in Section 4.4 hereof or otherwise available at law or in equity, after an event of default hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor thereto) as in effect in the State of New York from time to time (the "Code") (whether or not, to the extent permitted by law, the Code is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and the TRADES Regulations and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted. Wherever reference is made in this Agreement to any section of the Code, such reference shall be deemed to include a reference to any provision of the Code, which is a successor to, or amendment of, such section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such remedies may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) retention of the Pledged Notes or other Collateral in full satisfaction of the Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts or (ii) sale of the Pledged Notes or other Collateral in one or more public or private sales. (b) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, in the event the Collateral Agent is unable to make payments to the Company on account of the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) of the Treasury Portfolio or on account of principal payments of any Pledged Treasury Securities as provided in Article III hereof in satisfaction of the obligations of the Holder of the Securities of which such Pledged Treasury Securities, or the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, is a part under the related Purchase Contracts, the inability to make such payments shall constitute an event of default hereunder and the Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise, with reference to such Pledged Treasury Securities, or such appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest) in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, and such obligations of such Holder, any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Code and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise granted herein or under any other law. (c) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to receive and collect all payments of (i) principal and interest on the Pledged Notes, (ii) the principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities, or (iii) the appropriate Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, subject, in each case, to the provisions of Article III, and as otherwise granted herein. 21
(d) The Purchase Contract Agent, individually and as attorney-in-fact for each Holder of Securities, agrees that, from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent or such Holder shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as are necessary or as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to maintain the Pledge, and the perfection and priority thereof, and to confirm the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Collateral Agent hereunder, except for liability for its own negligent act, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct. Section 6.2 Tax Event Redemption. Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to a Successful Initial Remarketing, or, upon a Failed Initial Remarketing but a Successful Secondary Remarketing or, upon both a Failed Initial Remarketing and a Failed Secondary Remarketing, prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the aggregate Redemption Amount for each Pledged Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Pledged Note with respect to any Payment Date on or prior to the Tax Event Redemption Date, shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent by the Note Trustee on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, by check or wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and at such account as may be designated by the Collateral Agent in exchange for the Pledged Notes. In the event the Collateral Agent receives such aggregate Redemption Amount, and such accrued and unpaid interest (if any), the Collateral Agent will, at the written direction of the Company, apply such aggregate Redemption Amount to purchase from the Quotation Agent the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such aggregate Redemption Amount and such accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units. The Collateral Agent shall Transfer the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Account to secure the obligation of all Holders of Corporate Units to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company under the Purchase Contracts constituting a part of such Corporate Units, in substitution for the Pledged Notes. Thereafter the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as it had in respect of the Pledged Notes as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V and VI hereof, and any reference herein to the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio, and any reference herein to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to distributions on such Treasury Portfolio. Section 6.3 Initial Remarketing and Secondary Remarketing. The Collateral Agent shall, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding each of May 16, 2005, and, in the event of a Failed Initial Remarketing, July 1, 2005, without any instruction from any Holder of Corporate Units, present the related Pledged Notes to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing. Upon receiving such Pledged Notes, the Remarketing Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, will use its reasonable best efforts to remarket such Pledged Notes on such date at a price of 100.5% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price. After deducting as the Remarketing 22
Fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price from any amount of such Proceeds in excess of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price, the Remarketing Agent will remit the entire amount of the Proceeds of such remarketing to the Collateral Agent on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time on May 16, 2005 or July 1, 2005, as the case may be, by check or wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and at such account as may be designated by the Collateral Agent in exchange for the Pledged Notes. In the event the Collateral Agent receives such Proceeds, the Collateral Agent will, at the written direction of the Company, apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase from the Quotation Agent the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such Proceeds to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units. The Collateral Agent shall Transfer the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Account to secure the obligation of all Holders of Corporate Units to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company under the Purchase Contracts constituting a part of such Corporate Units, in substitution for the Pledged Notes. Thereafter the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as it had in respect of the Pledged Notes as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V and VI hereof, and any reference herein to the Notes shall be deemed to be reference to such Treasury Portfolio, and any reference herein to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to distributions on such Treasury Portfolio. Section 6.4 Substitutions. Whenever a Holder has the right to substitute Treasury Securities, Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for Collateral held by the Collateral Agent, such substitution shall not constitute a novation of the security interest created hereby. ARTICLE VII REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; COVENANTS Section 7.1 Representations and Warranties. The Holders from time to time, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of any of the Holders), each hereby represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent, which representations and warranties shall be deemed repeated on each day such Holder Transfers Collateral, that: (a) such Holder has the power to grant a security interest in and lien on the Collateral; (b) such Holder is the sole beneficial owner of the Collateral and, in the case of Collateral delivered in physical form, is the sole holder of such Collateral and is the sole beneficial owner of, or has the right to Transfer, the Collateral it Transfers to the Collateral Agent, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance, call, liability to pay money or other 23
restriction other than the security interest and lien granted under Article II hereof; (c) upon the Transfer of the Collateral to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will have a valid and perfected first priority security interest therein (assuming that any central clearing operation or any Intermediary or other entity not within the control of such Holder involved in the Transfer of the Collateral, including the Collateral Agent, gives the notices and takes the action required of it hereunder and under applicable law for perfection of that interest and assuming the establishment and exercise of control pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof); and (d) the execution and performance by such Holder of its obligations under this Agreement will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on the Collateral other than the security interest and lien granted under Article II hereof or violate any provision of any existing law or regulation applicable to it or of any mortgage, charge, pledge, indenture, contract or undertaking to which it is a party or which is binding on it or any of its assets. Section 7.2 Covenants. The Holders from time to time, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any covenant made by or on behalf of any of the Holders), each hereby covenants to the Collateral Agent that for so long as the Collateral remains subject to the Pledge: (a) neither the Purchase Contract Agent nor such Holder will create or purport to create or allow to subsist any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge or any other security interest whatsoever over the Collateral or any part of it other than pursuant to this Agreement; and (b) neither the Purchase Contract Agent nor such Holder will sell or otherwise dispose (or attempt to dispose) of the Collateral or any part of it except for the beneficial interest therein, subject to the pledge hereunder, transferred in connection with the Transfer of the Securities. ARTICLE VIII THE COLLATERAL AGENT Section 8.1 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. The Company hereby appoints the Collateral Agent as collateral agent and the Collateral Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Collateral Agent shall act as Agent for the Company hereunder with such powers as are specifically vested in the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each 24
of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary: (a) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be inferred from this Agreement against any of them, nor shall any of them be bound by the provisions of any agreement beyond the specific terms hereof; (b) shall not be responsible for any recitals contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by it under, this Agreement, the Securities or the Purchase Contract Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement (other than as against the Collateral Agent), the Securities or the Purchase Contract Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company or any other Person (except the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or for the perfection, priority or, except as expressly required hereby, maintenance of any security interest created hereunder (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to file or record any documents in any jurisdiction for purposes of perfecting or maintaining the security interest in the Collateral except those documents provided to it that it shall be directed in writing to execute and shall be filed by the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent); (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder (except in the case of the Collateral Agent, pursuant to directions furnished under Section 8.2 hereof, subject to Section 8.6 hereof); (d) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; (e) shall not be required to advise any party as to selling or retaining, or taking or refraining from taking any action with respect to, the Securities or other property deposited hereunder; and (f) shall not be responsible for the acts or omissions of any clearing corporation with whom collateral is deposited. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall have any obligation, duty or responsibility to take any action unless such action is non-discretionary and explicitly required hereunder or in a written direction from the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent given in accordance with the terms hereof. Subject to the foregoing, during the term of this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall take all reasonable action in connection with the safekeeping and preservation of the Collateral hereunder. No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder. In no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary be liable for any amount in excess of the Value of the Collateral or for any indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent and Securities Intermediary, each in its individual capacity, hereby waive any right of setoff, bankers lien, liens or perfection rights as securities intermediary or any counterclaim with respect to any of the Collateral. 25
Section 8.2 Instructions of the Company. The Company shall have the right, by one or more instruments in writing executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for the realization of any right or remedy available to the Collateral Agent, or of exercising any power conferred on the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, or to direct the taking or refraining from taking of any action authorized by this Agreement; provided that (i) such direction shall not conflict with the provisions of any law or of this Agreement and (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be adequately indemnified as provided herein. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall impair the right of the Collateral Agent in its discretion to take any action or omit to take any action which it deems proper and which is not inconsistent with such direction. Section 8.3 Reliance. Each of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely upon any certification, order, judgment, opinion, notice or other communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telex or facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons (without being required to determine the correctness of any fact stated therein), and upon advice and statements of legal counsel and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Company in accordance with this Agreement. Section 8.4 Rights in other Capacities. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their affiliates may (without having to account therefor to the Company) accept deposits from, lend money to, make their investments in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Purchase Contract Agent, any Holder of Securities and any holder of Separate Notes (and any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) as if it were not acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Purchase Contract Agent, any Holder of Securities or any holder of Separate Notes without having to account for the same to the Company; provided that each of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent covenants and agrees with the Company that it shall not accept, receive or permit there to be created in favor of itself and shall take no affirmative action to permit there to be created in favor of any other Person, any security interest, lien or other encumbrance of any kind in or upon the Collateral and the Collateral shall be segregated or the books and records of the Collateral Agent and not commingled with any other assets of any such Person. 26
Section 8.5 Non-Reliance. None of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Remarketing Agent or any Holder of Securities of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Securities or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Securities. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide the Company or the Remarketing Agent with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Purchase Contract Agent, any Holder of Securities or any holder of Separate Notes (or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective affiliates. Section 8.6 Compensation and Indemnity. The Company agrees: (i) to pay BNY Midwest Trust Company from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company for all services rendered by BNY Midwest Trust Company as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary hereunder and (ii) to indemnify the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary for, and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any loss, liability, claim, damage or reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its powers and duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of such powers and duties. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall each promptly notify the Company of any third party claim which may give rise to the indemnity hereunder and give the Company the opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and no such claim shall be settled without the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Section 8.7 Failure to Act. In the event of any ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement or any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the parties hereto or any other Person with respect to any funds or property deposited hereunder, each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall be entitled, after notice to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, at its sole option, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with respect to such property or funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall continue, and none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall be or become liable in any way to any of the parties hereto for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled to refuse to act until either (i) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been 27
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing, satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, or (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall have received security or an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, sufficient to save the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, harmless from and against any and all loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense which the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may incur by reason of its acting without bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may in addition elect to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may deem necessary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be required to take any action that is in its opinion contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability. Section 8.8 Resignation. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary as provided below, (a) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Securities, (b) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company and (c) if the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Purchase Contract Agent. No such removal shall be effective until a successor Collateral Agent has been appointed pursuant to this Section. The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's giving of notice of resignation or such removal, then the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. Each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be a bank with a combined capital and surplus of at least $75,000,000, which directly or 28
or through an affiliate maintains an office in The City of New York (in the State of New York). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall take all appropriate action to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor. The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Article VIII shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary. Section 8.9 Right to Appoint Agent or Advisor. The Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint agents or advisors in connection with any of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith. The appointment of agents pursuant to this Section 8.9 shall be subject to prior consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Section 8.10 Survival. The provisions of this Article VIII shall survive termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent. Section 8.11 Exculpation. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall any of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or their officers, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement to any third party for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, incurred without any act or deed that is found to be attributable to gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. 29

It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Article IX to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

If the Company shall so determine, new Certificates so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company, to any such amendment may be prepared and executed by the 31
Company and authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered by the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement and without charge or expense to Holders in exchange for Certificates evidencing Outstanding Securities. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS Section 10.1 No Waiver. To the extent permitted by law, no failure on the part of any party hereto or any of its agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party hereto or any of its agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
