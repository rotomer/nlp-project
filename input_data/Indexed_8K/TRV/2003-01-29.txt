It is understood that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Securities and that such additional Securities may be sold to or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and all as though the issuance of such Securities were authorized as of the date hereof.

The provisions of the Administrative Procedures shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder other than those made pursuant to a Terms Agreement. Each Agent and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of them in the Administrative Procedures. The Company will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Administrative Procedures as from time to time in effect. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities. As soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day in New York City, after receipt of notice from the Company, the Agents will suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed. During such period, the Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k). Upon advising the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed, however, the Company shall simultaneously provide the documents (if any) required to be delivered by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k), and the Agents shall have no obligation to solicit offers to purchase the Securities until such documents have been received by the Agents. In addition, any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations hereunder, including without limitation its obligations to deliver the documents required by Sections 4(h), 4(i), 4(j) and 4(k), shall automatically terminate the Agents' obligations hereunder, including without limitation its obligations to solicit offers to purchase the Securities hereunder as agent or to purchase Securities hereunder as principal.

(b) Each sale of Securities to any Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (unless the Company and such Agent shall otherwise agree) a Terms Agreement, which may be an oral agreement followed by a written confirmation by such Agent transmitted by facsimile transmission or other means mutually satisfactory to the parties thereto, and which will provide for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase thereof by, such Agent. Each Terms Agreement will contain substantially the information set forth in, and if in writing will be substantially in the form of, Annex I hereto. A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Securities by such Agent. The commitment of any Agent to purchase Securities as principal, whether pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of Securities to be purchased by any Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Company for such Securities, any provisions relating to rights of, and default by, underwriters acting together with such Agent in the reoffering of the Securities and the time and date and place of delivery of and payment for such Securities. Such Terms Agreement shall also specify any requirements for opinions of counsel, accountants' letters and officers' certificates pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Each Agent proposes to offer Securities purchased by it as principal for sale at prevailing market prices or prices related thereto at the time of sale, which may be equal to, greater than or less than the price at which such Securities are purchased by such Agent from the Company. For each sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a written Terms Agreement, the procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of such Securities and payment therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedures. For each such sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company agrees to pay such Agent a commission (or grant an equivalent discount) as provided in Section 2(a) hereof and in accordance with the schedule set forth therein. Each time and date of delivery of and payment for Securities to be purchased by an Agent as principal, whether pursuant to a written Terms Agreement or otherwise, set forth in a Terms Agreement or in accordance with the Administrative Procedures, is referred to herein as a "Time of Delivery". -8-
(c) Each Agent represents, warrants and agrees that: (i) it has not offered or sold and, prior to the expiry of a period of six months from the date of issue of such Securities, will not offer or sell any Securities to persons in the United Kingdom except to persons whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995; (ii) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA")) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Securities in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and (iii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Securities in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. 3.

The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent: (a) (i) To make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (A) prior to the Commencement Date which shall be disapproved by any Agent promptly after reasonable notice thereof or (B) after the date of any Terms Agreement or other agreement by an Agent to purchase Securities as principal and prior to the related Time of Delivery which shall be disapproved by any Agent party to such Terms Agreement or so purchasing as principal promptly after reasonable notice thereof; (ii) to prepare, with respect to any Securities to be sold through or to such Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a Pricing Supplement with respect to such Securities in a form previously approved by such Agent and to file such Pricing Supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act; (iii) to make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, other than any Pricing Supplement, at any time prior to having afforded each Agent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; (iv) to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such time period to advise such Agent, promptly after the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or has become effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus (other than any Pricing Supplement that relates to Securities not purchased through or by such Agent) has been filed with, or transmitted -9-

(b) Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably -21-
incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total -22-
commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Securities purchased by or through it were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 8. Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Securities from the Company and in performing the other obligations of such Agent hereunder (other than in respect of any purchase by an Agent as principal, pursuant to a written Terms Agreement or otherwise) is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Company was solicited by such Agent and has been accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to the Agent that -23-
solicited such offer any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale. 9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements by any Agent and the Company set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or the Company, or any officer or director or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Securities. 10. The provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the Company may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company as to any Agent or by any Agent as to such Agent upon the giving of written notice of such suspension or termination to such Agent or the Company, as the case may be. In the event of such suspension or termination with respect to any Agent, (x) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any Agent as to which such suspension or termination has not occurred, (y) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the rights and obligations of any party which have previously accrued or which relate to Securities which are already issued, agreed to be issued or the subject of a pending offer at the time of such suspension or termination and (z) in any event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect insofar as the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), Section 4(d), Section 4(e), Section 5, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 hereof are concerned. 11. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the Administrative Procedures, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 902-3000, Attention: Registration Department, and if to J.P.

This Agreement and any Terms Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, each Agent and the Company, and to the extent provided in Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and any person who controls any Agent or the Company, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities through or from any Agent hereunder shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. -24-
13. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement and any Terms Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 14. This Agreement and any Terms Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 15. This Agreement and any Terms Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. -25-

ANNEX II THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. Administrative Procedures These Administrative Procedures relate to the Securities defined in the Distribution Agreement, dated January 29, 2003 (the "Distribution Agreement"), between The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (the "Company") and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (together, the "Agents"), to which these Administrative Procedures are attached as Annex II. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Distribution Agreement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or the Indenture. To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture or the Distribution Agreement, the relevant provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Distribution Agreement shall control. The procedures to be followed with respect to the settlement of sales of Securities directly by the Company to purchasers solicited by an Agent, as agent, are set forth below. The terms and settlement details related to a purchase of Securities by an Agent, as principal, from the Company will be set forth in a Terms Agreement pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, unless the Company and such Agent otherwise agree as provided in Section 2(b) of the Distribution Agreement, in which case the procedures to be followed in respect of the settlement of such sale will be as set forth below. An Agent, in relation to a purchase of a Security by a purchaser solicited by such Agent, is referred to herein as the "Selling Agent" and, in relation to a purchase of a Security by such Agent as principal other than pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as the "Purchasing Agent". The Company will advise each Agent in writing of those persons with whom such Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Securities and the related settlement details. Each Security will be issued only in fully registered form and will be represented by either a global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary (a "Book-Entry Security") or a certificate issued in definitive form (a "Certificated Security") delivered to a person designated by an Agent, as set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. An owner of a Book-Entry Security will not be entitled to receive a certificate representing such a Security, except as provided in the Indenture. Book-Entry Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedures set forth in Part I hereof, and Certificated Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedures set forth in Part II hereof. PART I: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR BOOK-ENTRY SECURITIES In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Securities for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance

Posting Rates by the Company: The Company and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of interest per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Book-Entry Securities that may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent. The Company may establish a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an offering period ("posting"). If the Company decides to change already posted rates, it will promptly advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers until the new posted rates have been established with the Agents. Acceptance of Offers by the Company: Each Agent will promptly advise the Company by telephone or other appropriate means of all reasonable offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities, other than those rejected by such Agent. Each Agent may, in its discretion reasonably exercised, reject any offer received by it in whole or in part. Each Agent also may make offers to the Company to purchase Book-Entry Securities as a Purchasing Agent. The Company will have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Book-Entry Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. The Company will promptly notify the Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, of its acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities. If the Company accepts an offer to purchase Book-Entry Securities, it will confirm such acceptance in writing to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, and the Trustee. Communication of Sale Information to the Company by Agent and Settlement Procedures: A. After the acceptance of an offer by the Company, the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, will communicate promptly, but in no event later than the time set forth under "Settlement Procedures Timetable" below, the following details of the terms of such offer (the "Sale Information") to the Company by telephone (confirmed in writing) or by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means: (1) Principal Amount of Book-Entry Securities to be purchased; (2) If a Fixed Rate Book-Entry Security, the interest rate and initial interest payment date; (3) Trade Date; (4) Settlement Date; II-2

C. The Trustee will enter a pending deposit message through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System, providing the following settlement information to the Depositary, and the Depositary shall forward such information to such Agent and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group (or such other entity that assigns CUSIP numbers or any other identification designations being used for the relevant Securities): (1) The applicable Sale Information; (2) CUSIP number of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security; (3) Whether such Global Security will represent any other Book-Entry Security (to the extent known at such time); (4) Number of the participant account maintained by the Depositary on behalf of the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be; (5) The interest payment period; and (6) Initial Interest Payment Date for such Book-Entry Security, number of days by which such date succeeds the record date for the Depositary's purposes (which in the case of Floating Rate Securities which reset daily or weekly shall be the date five calendar days immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date and in the case of all other Book-Entry Securities shall be the Regular Record Date, as defined in the Security) II-4
and, if calculable at that time, the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date. D. The Trustee will complete and authenticate the Global Security previously delivered by the Company representing such Book-Entry Security. E. The Depositary will credit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account at the Depositary. F. The Trustee will enter an SDFS deliver order through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System instructing the Depositary to (i) debit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account and credit such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and (ii) debit such Agent's settlement account and credit the Trustee's settlement account for an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security less such Agent's commission or discount, as the case may be. The entry of such a deliver order shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Trustee to the Depositary that (a) the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security has been issued and authenticated and (b) the Trustee is holding such Global Security pursuant to the Certificate Agreement. G. Such Agent will enter an SDFS deliver order through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System instructing the Depositary (i) to debit such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and credit such Book-Entry Security to the participant accounts of the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security and (ii) to debit the settlement accounts of such participants and credit the settlement account of such Agent for an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security. H. Transfers of funds in accordance with SDFS deliver orders described in Settlement Procedures "F" and "G" will be settled in accordance with SDFS operating procedures in effect on the settlement date. I. Upon confirmation of receipt of funds, the Trustee will transfer to the account of the Company maintained at a bank located in New York, New York, or such other account as the Company may have previously specified to the Trustee, in immediately available funds in the amount transferred to the Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedures "F". J. Upon request, the Trustee will send to the Company a statement setting forth the principal amount of Book-Entry Securities outstanding as of that date under the Indenture. K. Such Agent will confirm the purchase of such Book-Entry Security to the purchaser either by transmitting to the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security a confirmation order or orders through the Depositary's institutional delivery system or by mailing a written confirmation to such purchaser. L. The Depositary will, at any time, upon request of the Company or the Trustee, promptly furnish to the Company or the Trustee a list of the names and II-5
addresses of the participants for whom the Depositary has credited Book-Entry Securities. Preparation of Pricing Supplement: If the Company accepts an offer to purchase a Book-Entry Security, it will prepare a Pricing Supplement reflecting the terms of such Book-Entry Security and arrange to have delivered to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, at least ten copies of such Pricing Supplement, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Trade Date (as defined below), or if the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on the Business Day following the date of acceptance of such offer, not later than noon, New York City time, on such date. The Company will arrange to have ten Pricing Supplements filed with the Commission not later than the close of business of the Commission on the fifth Business Day following the date on which such Pricing Supplement is first used. Delivery of Confirmation and Prospectus to Purchaser by Selling Agent: The Selling Agent will deliver to the purchaser of a Book-Entry Security a written confirmation of the sale and delivery and payment instructions. In addition, the Selling Agent will deliver to such purchaser or its agent the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing Supplement) in relation to such Book-Entry Security prior to or together with the earlier of the delivery to such purchaser or its agent of (a) the confirmation of sale or (b) the Book-Entry Security. Date of Settlement: The receipt by the Company of immediately available funds in payment for a Book-Entry Security and the authentication and issuance of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security shall constitute "settlement" with respect to such Book-Entry Security. All orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Company on a particular date (the "Trade Date") will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date") which is the third Business Day after the Trade Date pursuant to the "Settlement Procedures Timetable" set forth below, unless the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on another Business Day which shall be no earlier than the next Business Day after the Trade Date. Settlement Procedures Timetable: For orders of Book-Entry Securities solicited by a Selling Agent and accepted by the Company for settlement on the third Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "A" through "I" set forth above shall be completed as soon as possible but not later than the respective times (New York City time) set forth below: II-6
B. 3:00 P.M. on the Trade Date C. 5:00 P.M. No later than the close of business on the Trade Date D. 9:00 A.M. on the Settlement Date E. 10:00 A.M. on the Settlement Date F-G. 2:00 P.M. on the Settlement Date H. 4:45 P.M. on the Settlement Date I. 5:00 P.M. on the Settlement Date
If the initial interest rate for a Floating Rate Book-Entry Security has not been determined at the time that Settlement Procedures "A" is completed, Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined but no later than 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date. Settlement Procedures "H" is subject to extension in accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the Settlement Date. If settlement of a Book-Entry Security is rescheduled or canceled, the Trustee, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, will deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participation Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Settlement Date. Failure to Settle: If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a Book-Entry Security pursuant to Settlement Procedures "F", the Trustee may deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing the Depositary to debit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account, provided that the Trustee's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Security that is at least equal to the principal amount to be debited. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will mark such Global Security "canceled", make appropriate entries in the Trustee's records and send such canceled Global Security to the Company. The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedure, be canceled and not immediately reassigned. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will exchange such Global Security for two Global Securities, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Security or Securities and shall be canceled immediately after issuance II-7
and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry Securities previously represented by the surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Security. If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Security is not timely paid to the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in the Depositary, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such participants and, in turn, the Agent for such Book-Entry Security may enter deliver orders through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System debiting such Book-Entry Security to such participant's account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's account and then debiting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account and shall notify the Company and the Trustee thereof. Thereafter, the Trustee will (i) immediately notify the Company of such order and the Company shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use in an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security which was credited to the account of the Company maintained at the Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedures I, and (ii) deliver the withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph. If such failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable Agent to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use of funds during the period when the funds were credited to the account of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry Security, the Depositary may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect. In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedures "D", for the authentication and issuance of a Global Security representing the other Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by such Global Security and will make appropriate entries in its records. The Company will, from time to time, furnish the Trustee with a sufficient quantity of Securities. PART II: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR CERTIFICATED SECURITIES Posting Rates by Company: The Company and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of interest per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Certificated Securities that may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent.

The Company will have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Certificated Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. The Company will promptly notify the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, of its acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase Certificated Securities. If the Company accepts an offer to purchase Certificated Securities, it will confirm such acceptance in writing to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, and the Trustee.

The Selling Agent will immediately return the Certificated Security to the Trustee. Immediately upon receipt of such Certificated Security by the Trustee, the Company will return to the Selling Agent an amount equal to the amount previously paid to the Company in respect of such Certificated Security. The Company will reimburse the Selling Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of funds during the period when they were credited to the account of the Company. The Trustee will cancel the Certificated Security in respect of which the failure occurred, make appropriate entries in its records and, unless otherwise instructed by the Company, destroy the Certificated Security.

If the Holder has elected to receive payments in U.S. dollars, payment in respect of such Security will be based upon the exchange rate as determined by the -3-
Exchange Rate Agent based on the highest firm bid quotation for U.S. dollars received by such Exchange Rate Agent as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day next preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York, one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent, for purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment date of the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Securities electing to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holders of such Securities by deductions from such payments.

Payments of interest to be made in U.S. dollars (other than interest payable at maturity or upon earlier redemption or repayment) will be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears in the Security Register, or by wire transfer to such account as may have been appropriately designated to the Paying Agent at least 5 business days prior to the payment due date by such Person. Unless otherwise specified above, payments of interest and principal (and premium, if any) with respect to any Security made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account with a bank located in the country issuing the Specified Currency or in another jurisdiction acceptable to the Company and the Paying Agent as shall have been designated at least 5 business days prior to the Interest Payment Date or stated maturity, redemption or repayment date, as the case may be, by the registered Holder of this Security on the relevant Regular Record Date or maturity, redemption or repayment date, provided, however, that, in the case of payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest due at maturity or upon earlier redemption or repayment, this Security is -4-

If a payment with respect to this Security cannot be made by wire transfer because the required designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before the requisite date or for any other reason, a notice will be mailed to the Holder at its registered address requesting a designation pursuant to which such wire transfer can be made and, upon the Paying Agent's receipt of such a designation, such payment will be made within 5 business days of such receipt. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in connection with making payments by wire transfer, but any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payment will be borne by the Holder hereof in respect of which payments are made. Any late payments made in these circumstances will be treated under the Indenture as if made on the due date, and no interest will accrue on late payment from the due date to the date paid. [If the Security is to be a Global Security -- Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest due on this Security will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of this Security for all purposes under the Indenture.] If the Security is denominated in other than U.S. dollars and the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control or is no longer used by the government of the relevant country (unless otherwise replaced by the euro), then the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders by making payments in U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available Exchange Rate. The "Exchange Rate" means the noon buying rate in The City of New York for such cable transfers for such Specified Currency. Any payment made under the circumstances and in a manner described above will not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If the Specified Currency shown above is converted into or replaced by another currency pursuant to law having general and direct applicability in the jurisdiction which issued that Specified Currency (which may include European Community law), any payments in respect of this Security otherwise required to be made in such Specified Currency shall be made in the currency into or by which such Specified Currency has been so converted or replaced, based on the conversion or equivalency rate prescribed by law having general and direct applicability in such jurisdiction (which may include European Community law), and such Specified Currency shall not be deemed to be unavailable to the Company solely by reason of any such conversion or replacement. -5-
If any currency is introduced in the jurisdiction issuing the Specified Currency on the basis of legally enforceable equivalency to such Specified Currency pursuant to law having general and direct applicability in such jurisdiction (which may include European Community law) in preparation for conversion of such Specified Currency into, or replacement of such Specified Currency by, such other currency, the Company shall be entitled, at its option, to make any payments in respect of this Security otherwise required to be made in such Specified Currency in such other currency based on the equivalency rate prescribed by law having general and direct applicability in such jurisdiction (which may include European Community law). Making payments in accordance with this or the preceding paragraph shall not, by itself, constitute a default in the Company's obligations to make such payments. No occurrence of a currency conversion, replacement or introduction of a type described in this paragraph or the preceding paragraph involving the Specified Currency shall, by itself, entitle the Company to avoid its obligations under this Security or entitle the Company or any Holder of this Security to recession of the purchase and sale of this Security or to reformation of any of the terms hereof on the grounds of impossibility or impracticality of performance, frustration of purpose or otherwise. [If the Security is to be a Global Security -- This Security may not be transferred except as a whole by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary, or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor.

Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive registered form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture. Upon exchange of any portion of this Security for one or more Securities of this series in definitive registered form, the Trustee or the Security Registrar, as the case may be, shall cancel this Security and issue a new Security or Securities of this Series and of like tenor for the remaining principal amount.

If this Security is an Original Issue Discount Security, (i) if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount of principal of this Security which may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture, shall be determined in the manner set forth under "OID Default Amount" on the face hereof, and (ii) in the case of a default of payment in principal upon acceleration, redemption or at maturity hereof, in lieu of any interest otherwise payable, the overdue principal of this Security shall bear interest at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Default Rate stated on the face hereof (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from the date of such acceleration, redemption or maturity, as the case may be, to the date payment has been made or duly provided for or such default has been waived in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal, premium and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and premium and interest, if any, on the Securities of this series shall terminate.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day (as defined on the reverse hereof)), next preceding each Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable at maturity or upon earlier redemption or repayment will be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name -3-
this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of the series evidenced by this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made in the Specified Currency shown above, except as provided below. The Holder of a Security denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars may elect to receive all such payments in U.S. dollars by delivery of a written request to the Paying Agent, in the case of any interest payment due on an Interest Payment Date, on or prior to the applicable Record Date, or, in the case of any other payment, on or prior to the Special Record Date, if one has been established, or otherwise on the due date for such payment, and must be made at least fifteen calendar days prior to such payment due date. Such written request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission. Such election shall remain in effect unless such request is revoked on or prior to the applicable Record Date or the date fifteen days prior to such payment due date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any nominee of DTC, as Holder, will be deemed to have elected to receive all payments on a Security denominated other than in U.S. dollars, in U.S. dollars, except to the extent that such Holder requests, in accordance with the then current policies of DTC, that such payments be made in the Specified Currency, and to such extent payments on such Security will be made in the Specified Currency. If the Holder has elected to receive payments in U.S. dollars, payment in respect of such Security will be based upon the exchange rate as determined by the Exchange Rate Agent based on the highest firm bid quotation for U.S. dollars received by such Exchange Rate Agent as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day next preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York, one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent, for purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment date of the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Securities electing to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holders of such Securities by deductions from such payments. If three such bid quotations are not available on the second Business Day preceding the payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest with respect to any Security, such payment will be made in the Specified Currency. Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security due at maturity or upon earlier redemption or repayment to be made in U.S. dollars will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds upon surrender of -4-
this Security at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or such other payment office of a Paying Agent, provided that this Security is presented to the Paying Agent in time for the Paying Agent to make such payment in accordance with its normal procedures. Payments of interest to be made in U.S. dollars (other than interest payable at maturity or upon earlier redemption or repayment) will be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears in the Security Register, or by wire transfer to such account as may have been appropriately designated to the Paying Agent at least 5 business days prior to the payment due date by such Person. Unless otherwise specified above, payments of interest and principal (and premium, if any) with respect to any Security made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account with a bank located in the country issuing the Specified Currency or in another jurisdiction acceptable to the Company and the Paying Agent as shall have been designated at least 5 business days prior to the Interest Payment Date or stated maturity, redemption or repayment date, as the case may be, by the registered Holder of this Security on the relevant Regular Record Date or maturity, redemption or repayment date, provided, however, that, in the case of payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest due at maturity or upon earlier redemption or repayment, this Security is presented to the Paying Agent in time for the Paying Agent to make such payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Such designation shall be made by filing the appropriate information with the Paying Agent, and, unless revoked, or in the case of a Security held registered to a nominee of DTC, not later than the time required by then-current policies of DTC, any such designation made with respect to any Security by a registered Holder will remain in effect with respect to any further payments with respect to this Security payable to such Holder. If a payment with respect to this Security cannot be made by wire transfer because the required designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before the requisite date or for any other reason, a notice will be mailed to the Holder at its registered address requesting a designation pursuant to which such wire transfer can be made and, upon the Paying Agent's receipt of such a designation, such payment will be made within 5 business days of such receipt. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in connection with making payments by wire transfer, but any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payment will be borne by the Holder hereof in respect of which payments are made. Any late payments made in these circumstances will be treated under the Indenture as if made on the due date, and no interest will accrue on late payment from the due date to the date paid. [If the Security is to be a Global Security -- Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest due on this Security will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of this Security for all purposes under the Indenture.] If the Security is denominated in other than U.S. dollars and the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other -5-
circumstances beyond the Company's control, or is no longer used by the government of the relevant country (unless otherwise replaced by the euro) then the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders by making payments in U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available Exchange Rate. The "Exchange Rate" means the noon buying rate in the City of New York for cable transfers for such Specified Currency. Any payment made under the circumstances and in a manner described above will not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If the Specified Currency shown above is converted into or replaced by another currency pursuant to law having general and direct applicability in the jurisdiction which issued that Specified Currency (which may include European Community law), any payments in respect of this Security otherwise required to be made in such Specified Currency shall be made in the currency into or by which such Specified Currency has been so converted or replaced, based on the conversion or equivalency rate prescribed by law having general and direct applicability in such jurisdiction (which may include European Community law), and such Specified Currency shall not be deemed to be unavailable to the Company solely by reason of any such conversion or replacement. If any currency is introduced in the jurisdiction issuing the Specified Currency on the basis of legally enforceable equivalency to such Specified Currency pursuant to law having general and direct applicability in such jurisdiction (which may include European Community law) in preparation for conversion of such Specified Currency into, or replacement of such Specified Currency by, such other currency, the Company shall be entitled, at its option, to make any payments in respect of this Security otherwise required to be made in such Specified Currency in such other currency based on the equivalency rate prescribed by law having general and direct applicability in such jurisdiction (which may include European Community law). Making payments in accordance with this or the preceding paragraph shall not, by itself, constitute a default in the Company's obligations to make such payments. No occurrence of a currency conversion, replacement or introduction of a type described in this paragraph or the preceding paragraph involving the Specified Currency shall, by itself, entitle the Company to avoid its obligations under this Security or entitle the Company or any Holder of this Security to recession of the purchase and sale of this Security or to reformation of any of the terms hereof on the grounds of impossibility or impracticality of performance, frustration of purpose or otherwise.

[Form of Reverse of Security] [Floating Rate Medium-Term Note] THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES D This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 12, 2002 herein called the "Indenture (which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated on the face hereof. The Securities of this series may be issued from time to time in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies or composite currencies, may mature at different times, bear interest, if any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be issued at an original issue discount, and be denominated in different currencies; provided, however, that the foregoing limit may be increased or decreased by the Company, if in the future it determines that it may want to sell additional Securities of this series or other securities. If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or date of redemption or repayment) of this Security falls on a day that is not a Market Day (as defined below), the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be made on the next succeeding Market Day, or in the case of a LIBOR security, if such day falls in the next calendar month, the next preceding Market Day, as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on such payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or date of redemption or repayment), as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Market Day. This Security is not convertible or subject to any sinking fund, and unless a Redemption Commencement Date, Redemption Periods and Redemption Prices are specified on the face hereof, this Security is not subject to redemption prior to the Stated Maturity Date shown above. If so specified, this Security is subject to redemption upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, during the Redemption Periods and at the Redemption Prices specified on the face hereof, plus interest accrued to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of this Security, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture. R-1
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor and for a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. This Security is not subject to repayment prior to the Stated Maturity Date shown above unless a Repayment Date, Repayment Periods and Repayment Prices are specified above. If so specified, this Security is subject to repayment at the option of the Holder hereof upon the terms set forth above by completing the form for the Option to Elect Repayment that is attached. In the event of repayment of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor and for a principal amount equal to the unpaid portion will be issued to the registered Holder upon the cancellation hereof. The interest rate payable on this Security will be calculated by reference to the Interest Rate Basis specified above (a) plus or minus the Spread specified above, if any, or (b) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier specified above, if any. The Interest Rate Basis may be: (a) the Commercial Paper Rate, (b) the Prime Rate, (c) the CD Rate, (d) the Federal Funds Rate, (e) LIBOR, (f) EURIBOR, (g) the Treasury Rate, (h) the CMT Rate or such other interest rate formula, as specified above. The "Index Maturity" is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the Interest Rate Basis is calculated, as specified above. All percentages resulting from any calculation on this Security will be rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (e.g., 9.876541% (or .09876541) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on this Security will be rounded to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency or composite currency, to the nearest corresponding unit or more (with one-half cent or unit or more being rounded upward). Amounts of one-half cent or one-half of a corresponding unit or more will be rounded upward. Unless otherwise specified above, the "Regular Record Date" with respect to this Security shall be the date 15 calendar days prior to each Interest Payment Date, whether or not such date shall be a Business Day, and interest will be payable, in the case of Securities which reset daily, weekly or monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month or on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year (as specified above); which reset quarterly, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; which reset semi-annually, on the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified above; and which reset annually, on the third Wednesday of the month specified above (each an "Interest Payment Date"); and in each case, at maturity or upon earlier redemption or repayment. Payments of interest with respect to any Interest Payment Date or date of maturity, redemption or repayment will include interest accrued to but excluding such R-2
Interest Payment Date or date of maturity, redemption or repayment, as the case may be. Accrued interest from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest has been paid is calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor, computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from such starting date to but excluding the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such day by 360, unless otherwise specified, or, in the case of a Treasury Rate Security and a CMT Rate Security, by the actual number of days in the year. The rate of interest on this Security will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually or otherwise (each an "Interest Reset Date"), as specified above. Unless otherwise specified above, the Interest Reset Date will be, if this Security resets daily, each Business Day, if this Security resets weekly and is not a Treasury Rate Security, the Wednesday of each week, or if this Security resets weekly and is a Treasury Rate Security, the Tuesday of each week (except as provided below); if this Security resets monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; if this Security resets quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; if this Security resets semi-annually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year, as specified above; and if this Security resets annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year, as specified above; provided, however, that the interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate specified above. If any Interest Payment Date, other than at maturity, redemption or repayment, would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Market Day (as defined below), the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Market Day and interest will accrue to such Market Day, or if this Security is a LIBOR Security and such Market Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Market Day. As used herein, the term "Market Day" means any Business Day except that for any LIBOR Note, any such Business Day that is also a London Business Day. The term "London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in the Index Currency are transacted in the London Interbank Market. The term "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is (i) not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York generally are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close, (ii) if the Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars or euros, it must also not be a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in the financial center of the country issuing the Specified Currency, and (iii) if the Specified Currency is euro, any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System, or any successor system, is open for business (a euro business day). The Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for a Commercial Paper Rate Security (the "Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date"), for a Prime Rate Security (the "Prime Rate Interest Determination Date"), for a CD Rate R-3
Security (the "CD Rate Interest Determination Date"), for a Federal Funds Rate Security (the "Federal Funds Interest Determination Date") and for a CMT Rate Note (the "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date") will in each case be the second Market Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for a LIBOR Security (the "LIBOR Interest Determination Date") will be the second London Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date, unless the Index Currency is British pounds sterling, in which case the Interest Determination Date will be the applicable Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for a EURIBOR Security (the "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date") will be the second Euro Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Security (the "Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date") will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills would normally be auctioned. Treasury bills are usually sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is normally held on the following Tuesday, except that such auction may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Treasury Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week. If an auction date would fall on any Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Security, then such Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Market Day immediately following such auction date. Unless otherwise specified above, the Calculation Date pertaining to any Interest Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, whichever is the day on which the next payment of interest will be due. Determination of Commercial Paper Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the Commercial Paper Rate, the interest rate with respect to any Interest Reset Date shall equal the Money Market Yield, calculated as described below, of the per annum rate quoted on a bank discount basis, for the relevant Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the specified Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("H.15(519)") under the heading "Commercial Paper-Non-financial". If such rate does not appear in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, then the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be the Money Market Yield of such rate on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the specified Index Maturity as available through the world-wide web site of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("H.15 Daily Update") or such R-4
other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the heading "Commercial Paper-Non-financial". An Index Maturity of one month or three months will be deemed to be equivalent to an Index Maturity of 30 days or 90 days, as the case may be. If by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date such rate is not yet published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered yearly rates, quoted on a bank discount basis, as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity shown above placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized rating agency. If fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. Money Market Yield shall be a yield, expressed as a percentage, calculated in accordance with the following formula: Money Market Yield = 100 x 360 x D ------------ 360 - (D x M) In the above formula, "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal; and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the period from and including the Interest Reset Date to but excluding the next Interest Reset Date, or the maturity, redemption or repayment date, as appropriate. Determination of Prime Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the Prime Rate, the interest rate with respect to any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate set forth for the relevant Prime Rate Interest Determination Date in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan". If such rate does not appear in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, then the Prime Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the rate for the relevant Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate under the heading "Bank Prime Loan". R-5
If prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, then the Prime Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the "Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page" as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. The "Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page" is the display designated as page "USPRIME1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or any successor service), or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 Page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks. If fewer than four such rates appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the Prime Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates, quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year, as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than three banks selected as by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. Determination of CD Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the CD Rate, the interest rate with respect to any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate for the relevant CD Interest Determination Date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15(519) under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)". In the event that such rate does not appear in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, then the CD Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be the rate on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date for U.S. dollar negotiable certificates of deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate under the heading "CDs (secondary market)". If by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, the CD Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates, as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such CD Rate Interest R-6
Determination Date, of three leading nonbank dealers of negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money market banks with a remaining maturity closest to the specified Index Maturity and in a representative amount. Representative amount means an amount that, in the Calculation Agent's judgment, is representative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. If fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the CD Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the CD Rate in effect on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. Determination of Federal Funds Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the Federal Funds Rate, the interest rate with respect to any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate on the relevant Federal Funds Interest Determination Date for U.S. dollar Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)" as such rate is displayed on MoneyLine Telerate (or any successor service) ("Telerate") on page 120 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service). In the event that such rate does not appear on Telerate page 120 prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, then the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the rate on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)". If by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date such rate is not published on Telerate page 120, H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates, as of 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date, for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar Federal Funds arranged by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar Federal Funds transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than three brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. R-7
Determination of LIBOR. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is LIBOR, the interest rate with respect to any Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions: (i) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be: (a) if LIBOR Reuters is specified above, the arithmetic mean of the offered rates, or the offered rate if the Designated LIBOR Page, as defined below, by its terms provides only for a single rate, for deposits in the Index Currency, as defined below, having the Index Maturity specified above, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, that appear or appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date; or (b) if LIBOR Telerate is specified above, or if neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is specified above as the method of calculating LIBOR, the rate for deposits in the Index Currency having the Index Maturity specified above, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date. (ii) If fewer than two such offered rates referenced in (i) above appear, or if no such rate appears, as applicable, LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined as follows: The Calculation Agent will request from the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, its offered quotation for deposits in the Index Currency for the period of the Index Maturity designated above, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such Index Currency in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., or such other time specified above, in the applicable principal financial center, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in such principal financial center selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in the Index Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity designated above and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such Index Currency in such market at such time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR Interest R-8
Determination Date will be LIBOR in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. As used here: Designated LIBOR Page means (a) if LIBOR Reuters is specified above, the display on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service, or any successor service, for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the applicable Index Currency, or (b) if LIBOR Telerate is specified above or neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is specified above as the method for calculating LIBOR, the display on Telerate, for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the applicable Index Currency. Index Currency means the currency, including composite currencies, specified above as the currency for which LIBOR shall be calculated. If no such currency is specified above, the Index Currency shall be United States dollars. Determination of EURIBOR. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is EURIBOR, the interest rate with respect to any Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent or its affiliates in accordance with the following provisions: (i) With respect to a EURIBOR interest determination date, EURIBOR will be the offered rate for deposits in euros having the Index Maturity specified above, commencing on the second euro business day after the relevant EURIBOR Interest Determination Date, as that rate appears on Telerate page 248 as of 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date; or (ii) If such offered rate does not appear on Telerate page 248, as referenced in (i) above, EURIBOR on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined as follows: The Calculation Agent will request from the principal Euro-Zone office of each of four major banks in the Euro-Zone interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, its offered quotation for euro deposits for the period of the Index Maturity designated above, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date and in the representative amount to prime banks in that market at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR for the relevant EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, EURIBOR determined on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time or such other time specified above on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in the Euro-Zone selected by the Calculation Agent for loans of euros to leading euro-zone R-9
banks having the Index Maturity designated above commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date and in a representative amount. If fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph, EURIBOR with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be EURIBOR in effect on such EURIBOR Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. As used here: Euro-Zone means, at any time the region comprised of the member states of the European Economic and Monetary Union that, as of that time, have adopted a single currency in accordance with the Treaty on European Union of February 1992. Determination of Treasury Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the Treasury Rate, the interest rate with respect to any Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate for the auction on the relevant Treasury Interest Determination Date of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified above as that rate appears on Telerate page 56 or 57 under the heading "Investment Rate". If such rate does not appear in either page by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate for the relevant Interest Determination Date, calculated as described below, for the type of Treasury Bill described above, as published in H.15 Daily Update or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High". If the rate described in the preceding sub-paragraph does not appear in H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant interest Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the auction rate, for the relevant Treasury Interest Determination Date and for Treasury Bills of the kind described above, as announced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. If the results of such auction of Treasury Bills having the specified Index Maturity are not published or reported as provided above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, or if no such auction is held during such week, then the Treasury Rate shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate set forth in H.15(519) for the relevant Treasury Interest Determination Date and for Treasury Bills having a remaining maturity closest to the specified Index Maturity under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market". R-10
If the rate described above does not appear in H.15(519) by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant interest Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate will be the rate for the relevant Treasury Interest Determination Date and for the type of Treasury Bill described above, as published in H.15 Daily Update or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market". If the rate described in the preceding sub-paragraph is not so published in H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, the Treasury Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury Interest Determination Date, of three primary United States government securities dealers in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the specified Index Maturity. If fewer than three dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Treasury Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Treasury Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. Bond Equivalent Yield shall be a yield, expressed as a percentage, calculated in accordance with the following formula: Bond Equivalent Yield = D x N x 100 ------------- 360 - (D x M) In the above formula, "D" refers to the yearly rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal; "N" means 365 or 366 as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the period from and including the interest reset date to, but excluding the next interest reset date, or the maturity, redemption or repayment date, as appropriate. Determination of CMT Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the CMT Rate, the interest rate with respect to any CMT Interest Reset Date shall equal the rate displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page, as defined below, under the caption ". . . Treasury Constant Maturities . . . Federal Reserve Board Release, H.15 . . . Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.," under the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index, as defined below, for (i) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7051, the rate on the related CMT Rate Interest Determination Date and (ii) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the week or the month, as specified above, ended immediately preceding the week or month (as applicable) in which the related CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. R-11
If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or is not displayed prior to 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from that source at that time, then the CMT Rate with respect to such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be such Treasury Constant Maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as published in H.15(519). If such rate is no longer published, or, is not published by 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be such Treasury Constant Maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date with respect to such Interest Reset Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page and published in H.15(519). If such information is not provided by 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three primary United States government securities dealers (each, a "Reference Dealer") in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for the most recently issued treasury notes having an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than the Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. In selecting those offered rates, the Calculation Agent will request quotations from five such Reference Dealers and will eliminate the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest). If the Calculation Agent cannot obtain three such Treasury notes quotations, the CMT Rate for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in The City of New York, selected by the Calculation Agent for Treasury notes with an original maturity longer than the Designated CMT Maturity Index, with a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in a representative amount. In selecting these offered rates, the Calculation Agent will request quotations from five such Reference Dealers and will eliminate the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest). If three or four, and not five, of such Reference Dealers are quoting as described in the preceding sub-paragraph, then the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest R-12
Determination Date will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotes will be eliminated. If fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described above, the CMT Rate will be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. If the initial base rate has been in effect prior to such interest reset date, however, it will remain in effect until the next interest reset date. If two Treasury notes with an original maturity as described above have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, the quotes for the Treasury note with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used. As used above: Designated CMT Telerate Page means the display on Telerate on the page designated above -- or any other page as may replace such page on that service for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519) -- for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519). If no such page is specified above, the Designated CMT Telerate Page shall be 7052, for the most recent week. Designated CMT Maturity Index means the original period to maturity of the U.S. Treasury securities, either 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20 or 30 years, specified above, with respect to which the CMT Rate will be calculated. If no such maturity is specified above, the Designated CMT Maturity Index shall be two years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, shown above. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate on this Security in accordance with the foregoing on each Interest Determination Date or Calculation Date as applicable. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. The interest rate on this Security will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as it may be modified by United States law of general application. The Calculation Agent will upon the request of the Holder of this Security provide to such Holder the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date. The Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate, and its calculation of the amount of interest for any interest period is final and binding in the absence of manifest error. If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, an amount of principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. R-13
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of this Security or (ii) certain restrictive covenants with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the majority of the Holders in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent of waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security or Securities issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium, and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth (including, in the case of a Global Security, certain additional limitations), the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security is payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in a form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of (i) if denominated in U.S. dollars, $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof or (ii) if this Security is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, in the denominations indicated on the face hereof, equivalent to $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, using an exchange rate equal to the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for such Specified Currency on the first Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Company accepts the offer to buy such Security, unless otherwise specified above. The Securities of this series may be issued, in whole or in part, in the form of one or more Global Securities bearing the legend specified in the Indenture regarding certain restrictions on registration of transfer and exchange and issued to DTC or its nominee and R-14
registered in the name of DTC or such nominee. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations (including, in the case of any Global Security, certain additional limitations) therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor if a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange of Securities as provided above, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of a Security of this series for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture and not herein otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. R-15
