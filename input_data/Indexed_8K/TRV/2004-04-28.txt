ST. PAUL, Minn. (April 28, 2004)
 
On April 1, 2004, Travelers and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul) completed their previously announced merger. The combined company is now known as St. Paul Travelers. For accounting purposes, Travelers is the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, in this press release and going forward, the stand-alone results of operations of Travelers for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and all prior periods will be presented as the results of St. Paul Travelers for those periods. The results of the combined operations will be consolidated for all future periods beginning in the second quarter. For the first quarter 2004, St. Paul's stand-alone net income, which is not included in the St. Paul Travelers results described above, increased to $188.0 million from $181.0 million in the prior year quarter.
 
Achieved record operating income of $614.4 million, an 82 percent increase from the prior year quarter. Earnings include a significant increase in net investment income due to higher returns on alternative investments and continued strong current accident year results for both Commercial and Personal Lines. The combined ratio improved to 91.9 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Reported a record operating return on equity of 21.9 percent (excluding FAS 115).
 - 
                 
 
Increased net written premiums by 10 percent to $3.47 billion with growth in both Commercial and Personal Lines.
 - 
                 
 
"Generally, market conditions remain strong. The combination of current rate levels and anticipated loss trends continue to generate significant margins in our businesses. While we are in the early days of the merger, the integration is going very well. We are enthusiastic about the support we are receiving from our agents, brokers and employees and have a high degree of confidence that we will achieve our goals and objectives," said Jay S. Fishman, Chief Executive Officer.

*Reflects only the results of Travelers
 
Operating income for the quarter was $614.4 million compared to $338.5 million in the prior year quarter. The difference between net and operating income in the current and prior year quarters is the inclusion in net income of net realized investment gains (losses).
 
The consolidated underwriting gain component of operating income, before catastrophes and prior year reserve development, increased $60.6 million to $212.0 million, after tax, primarily due to increased earned premiums, in part resulting from the favorable impact of higher premium rates in both Commercial and Personal Lines. Catastrophe losses due to the winter storms in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were $13 million, compared to $43.7 million in the prior year quarter. The first quarter also included a net charge for prior year reserve development of $28.1 million compared to $106.2 million in the prior year quarter. (See "Prior Year Reserve Development" below.)
 
Net investment income, after tax, increased $110.5 million to $454.3 million compared to $343.8 million in the prior year quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to higher returns on alternative investments, principally due to the initial public trading in the first quarter of 2004 of an investment held by one of our private equity investment partnerships, which added $82.8 million, after tax, to investment income. The increase is also due to higher average invested assets resulting from continuing strong operating cash flows, partially offset by lower average yields on fixed income securities.
 
Commercial Lines net written premiums increased 4 percent to $2.10 billion from the prior year quarter. In general, retentions remained consistent with prior levels, rate increases continued at a moderating level and new business growth was modestly lower than in previous quarters. Personal Lines net written premiums increased 19 percent primarily due to increased new business volume, strong retention and moderate rate increases.
 
 
(1)  For purposes of computing GAAP combined ratios, effective 1Q 2004, billing and policy fees, which are a component of other revenues, are allocated as a reduction of other underwriting expenses.  Prior periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation.
 
Note: See Glossary of Financial Measures on page 10.
 
The 1.9 point improvement in the consolidated GAAP combined ratio, before catastrophes and prior year reserve development, to 89.5 percent, reflects a 2.8 point improvement in the loss and LAE ratio and a 0.9 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio. The improvement in the loss and LAE ratio was primarily due to the favorable impact of higher premium rates. The improvement in the consolidated GAAP combined ratio also reflects more moderate catastrophe losses and significantly less prior year reserve development.
 
 
 
Note: See Glossary of Financial Measures on page 10.
Commercial Lines prior year reserve development in the current quarter, which resulted in a net charge of $93.7 million, after reinsurance and tax, primarily related to certain businesses that were placed into run off in prior years. The reserve strengthening in the quarter was partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development primarily in our property and commercial multi-peril businesses. The prior year quarter included a $128.9 million charge, net of reinsurance and tax, with the most significant component being a $174.9 million charge, net of reinsurance and tax, related to reserve strengthening for an auto residual value business which was placed into runoff in 2001. The reserve strengthening in the first quarter of 2003 was partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development primarily in our property business.
 
Personal Lines favorable prior year reserve development of $65.6 million and $22.7 million, net of reinsurance and tax, in the 2004 and 2003 quarters, respectively, primarily resulted from lower then expected levels of non-catastrophe-related property claim frequency in our homeowners business.
 
Commercial Lines Operating Income Exceeds $400 Million
 
 
Note: See Glossary of Financial Measures on page 10.
 
Commercial Lines operating income was $401.8 million compared to $260.9 million in the prior year quarter. The underwriting gain, before catastrophes and prior year reserve development, increased to $145.5 million primarily due to increased premium and fee revenue. There were no catastrophe losses in the quarter compared to $19.5 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment income increased 27 percent to $352.4 million due to the initial public trading of an investment held by one of our private equity investment partnerships, as discussed above, which added $55.5 million, after tax, to investment income. (See "Prior Year Reserve Development" above.)
 
Commercial Lines net written premiums increased $88.4 million or 4 percent from the prior year quarter. In general, retentions remained consistent with prior levels, rate increases continued at a moderating level and new business growth was modestly lower than in previous quarters.
 
Core
 
In National Accounts, which provides loss-sensitive insurance products to large corporations and fee-based services to self-insured corporations and state-sponsored workers' compensation residual market pools, net written premiums of $243.6 million increased 7 percent over the prior year quarter. Written fees rose 17 percent to $213.5 million, from $182.2 million in the prior year quarter. Additions to claim volume under administration amounted to $1.31 billion, an increase of 19.3 percent over the prior year quarter. National Accounts continued to benefit from rate increases, along with higher new business volumes that, in part, resulted from our third quarter 2003 renewal rights transaction with Royal & SunAlliance, and increases in residual market pools.
 - 
                 
 
In Commercial Accounts, which primarily serves mid-sized businesses, net written premiums increased 3 percent to $974.0 million. Disciplined underwriting due to increased competition in our construction business and the cancellation of certain specialty programs written by our Northland subsidiary reduced overall growth. Excluding these two business lines, net written premiums increased 9 percent over the prior year quarter.
 - 
                 
 
In Select Accounts, which serves small businesses, net written premiums increased 4 percent to $530.7 million due to moderating rate increases and modestly lower retention and new business volume.
 - 
                 
 
Specialty
 
In Bond, which provides surety bonds and executive liability insurance for small and mid-sized accounts, net written premiums increased 31 percent to $213.0 million. This increase reflects the favorable rate environment and strong new business volume, principally in executive liability products.
 - 
                 
In Gulf, which provides a broad range of management and professional liability coverages and excess and surplus lines of insurance, net written premiums decreased 14 percent to $143.6 million, primarily due to reduced volumes in management liability product lines principally resulting from increased competition and our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline.
 -

Note: See Glossary of Financial Measures on page 10.
 
The 1.4 point improvement to 88.9 percent in the Commercial Lines GAAP combined ratio, before catastrophes and prior year reserve development, reflects a 2.3 point improvement in the loss and LAE ratio, resulting from the favorable impact of higher rates. Prior year reserve development increased the combined ratio by 7.1 points in the current quarter as compared to 10.8 points in the prior year quarter. (See "Prior Year Reserve Development" above.)
 
Personal Lines Achieves Strong Earnings and Premium Growth
 
 
Note: See Glossary of Financial Measures on page 10.
Personal Lines operating income was $237.1 million compared to $112.5 million in the prior year quarter. The underwriting gain, before catastrophes and prior year reserve development, increased 89 percent to $66.5 million primarily due to the favorable rate environment and growth in business volumes in both Automobile and Homeowners and other. Catastrophe losses of $13.0 million were $11.2 million lower in the current quarter than in the prior year quarter and were due to winter storms in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Net investment income increased 57 percent to $101.9 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the initial public trading of an investment held by one of our private equity investment partnerships, as discussed above, which added $27.3 million, after tax, to investment income. (See "Prior Year Reserve Development" above.)
 
 
Net written premiums increased $216.4 million, or 19 percent, over the prior year quarter due to higher business volumes, which resulted in part from the Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction, and continued increases in rates in both the Automobile and the Homeowners and other lines of business.
 
Automobile net written premiums increased 15 percent to $846.9 million. Retention levels continued to be strong and policies in force rose for the twelfth consecutive quarter, increasing by 8 percent from the prior year quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Homeowners and other net written premiums increased 26 percent to $519.5 million. Retention levels also continued to be strong and policies in force rose for the seventh consecutive quarter, increasing 9 percent from the prior year quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Production through independent agents, which represented 83 percent of net written premiums compared to 82 percent in the prior year quarter, was up 20 percent to $1.13 billion. Production through other channels, which includes affinity and joint marketing arrangements, was up 13 percent to $232.2 million.
 - 
                 
 
(1)  For purposes of computing GAAP combined ratios, effective 1Q 2004, billing and policy fees, which are a component of other revenues, are allocated as a reduction of other underwriting expenses.  Prior periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation.
 
Note: See Glossary of Financial Measures on page 10.
 
The 2.9 point improvement to 90.5 percent in the Personal Lines GAAP combined ratio, before catastrophes and prior year reserve development, reflects a 3.8 point improvement in the loss and LAE ratio and an increase of 0.9 points in the underwriting expense ratio. The improvement in the loss and LAE ratio resulted from the favorable rate environment and continuing favorable non-catastrophe-related property claim frequency. Catastrophes increased the combined ratio by 1.5 points while favorable prior year reserve development lowered the combined ratio by 7.8 points. (See "Prior Year Reserve Development" above.)
 
The after-tax charge of $24.5 million in the quarter for Interest Expense and Other decreased from $34.9 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower interest expense. Interest expense was $22.8 million, after tax, in the current year quarter, as compared to $32.8 million in the 2003 quarter. The lower interest expense resulted from reduced interest rates due to the 2003 debt refinancing activities and lower levels of debt obligations.
 
This increase is primarily attributable to higher returns on alternative investments, principally due to the initial public trading in the first quarter of 2004 of an investment held by one of our private equity investment partnerships, which added $82.8 million, after tax, to investment income. The increase is also due, to a lesser extent, to higher average invested assets resulting from continuing strong operating cash flows, partially offset by lower average yields on fixed income securities. The overall after-tax investment yield of 4.9 percent was up 90 and 70 basis points, respectively, from the prior year quarter and fourth quarter of 2003.
After-tax net investment income increased 32 percent to $454.3 million compared to $343.8 million in the prior year quarter.
Net realized investment losses of $41.9 million for the quarter ($27.2 million, after tax) principally resulted from $55.1 million ($35.8 million, after tax) of net realized investment losses related to U.S. Treasury futures which are settled daily and are used to shorten the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio. Also impacting net realized investment losses in the current quarter were $11.1 million of impairments. Net realized investment gains of $6.5 million for the prior year quarter ($1.5 million, after tax and minority interest) resulted from net investment gains of $64.7 million ($42.1 million, after tax), principally from the sale of fixed maturity securities, which were mostly offset by impairments of $58.2 million ($37.8 million, after tax), primarily relating to corporate bonds in the healthcare, communications and aviation sectors.
 
Invested assets, after adjusting for the effects of securities in process of settlement and securities lending activities, were $38.86 billion, an increase of $1.27 billion over the comparable December 31, 2003 amount. Invested assets benefited from strong operating cash flows and the higher carrying value of the fixed maturity portfolio resulting from lower interest rates. Net unrealized investment gains as of March 31, 2004, were $1.88 billion ($1.22 billion after tax and minority interest), compared to $1.63 billion ($1.06 billion after tax and minority interest), as of December 31, 2003.
 
Results for St. Paul on a stand alone basis, which are not included in the results of St. Paul Travelers discussed above, are summarized as follows:
 
Reported net income of $188.0 million as compared to $181.0 million in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter included $71.7 million of after tax net realized investment gains due to the shifting of a portion of fixed income securities into tax-exempts and gains taken in the public equity and venture capital portfolios.
 - 
                 
 
Generated after tax operating income of $124.4 million compared to $206.2 million in the prior year quarter. The difference between net income and operating income is the inclusion in net income of realized gains of $71.7 million and a loss from discontinued operations of $8.1 million. The current quarter included an after tax charge of $53.2 million ($73.5 million pre-tax) due to a reduction in an estimated reinsurance recovery; after-tax charges of $22.8 million ($22.8 million pre-tax) and $19.5 million ($17.6 million pre-tax) due to reserve strengthening in certain international and reinsurance businesses previously placed into run-off, respectively; an after tax charge of $28.5 million ($43.8 million pre-tax) related to a construction contractor in St. Paul's surety operations; and, an after-tax charge of $16.2 million ($24.3 million pre-tax) for reserve strengthening in several other lines of business.
 - 
                 
 
Reported strong operating results at Nuveen, with operating income up 23 percent to $32 million from the prior year quarter and assets under management in excess of $100 billion, up 6 percent from December 31, 2003.
 - 
                 
 
Generated net written premiums of $1.81 billion, a 9 percent decrease from the prior year quarter. Excluding runoff business and the impact in the prior year quarter of eliminating a one quarter lag in reporting business results from St. Paul's Lloyd's operations, net written premiums increased 1 percent to $1.79 billion from the prior year quarter. Specialty Commercial net written premiums decreased 10 percent to $1.16 billion (a 3 percent decrease excluding the one quarter lag adjustment for St. Paul's Lloyd's operations described above) from the prior year quarter, primarily due to underwriting action taken in construction, surety and Lloyd's. Commercial Lines net written premiums were $631 million, a 7 percent increase compared to the prior year quarter.

Glossary of Financial Measures
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. These measures are components of net income but, in some cases, are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income, and in some cases, require inclusion or exclusion of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in a GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding
of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations.
 
  Net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), income (or loss) from discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.
Operating income and operating income per share:
 
Return on equity is the ratio of net income to average equity.  Operating return on equity is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on investment securities, net of tax.
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  In particular, net realized investment gains or losses are significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. In addition, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity internally to evaluate performance against historical results and established financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
  The profit or loss experienced by a property casualty insurance company after deducting claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses from net earned premiums and fee income. This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income.
Underwriting gain or loss:
 
Underwriting gain or loss measures the return on the Company's in force property casualty contracts and reflects the contribution of underwriting activities to earnings. Underwriting gain or loss includes the effects of catastrophes and loss reserve development.
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
 - 
                 
catastrophe
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 - 
                 
Loss reserve development
 
The Company uses to represent the contribution to earnings from current period underwriting (i.e., without development on business earned in prior periods) and the highly irregular effects of catastrophes. A reconciliation of these measures to net income is provided on page 2.

Forward Looking Statement
 
This press release may contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, we may have forward-looking statements about our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of our asbestos reserves and the integration following the merger. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
In particular, the sufficiency of our asbestos reserves, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, to the extent impacted by the sufficiency of our asbestos reserves, is subject to a number of potential adverse developments including, among others, adverse developments involving asbestos claims and related litigation, the willingness of parties, including us, to settle disputes, the impact of aggregate policy coverage limits and the impact of bankruptcies of various asbestos producers and related businesses.
 
Some of the other factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to fully integrate the former St. Paul and Travelers businesses in the manner or in the timeframe currently anticipated; our inability to obtain price increases due to competition or otherwise; the performance of the Company's investment portfolios, which could be adversely impacted by adverse developments in U.S. and global financial markets, interest rates and rates of inflation; weakening U.S. and global economic conditions; insufficiency of, or changes in, loss reserves; the occurrence of catastrophic events, both natural and man-made, including terrorist acts, with a severity or frequency exceeding the Company's expectations; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, environmental claims and related litigation; the impact of claims related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, including, but not limited to, lead paint, silica and other potentially harmful substances; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including  inflationary pressures in medical costs and auto and home repair costs; developments relating to coverage and liability for mold claims; the effects of corporate bankruptcies on surety bond claims; adverse developments in the cost, availability and/or ability to collect reinsurance; the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company; adverse outcomes in legal proceedings; judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability; the impact of legislative actions, including federal and state legislation related to asbestos liability reform; larger than expected assessments for guaranty funds and mandatory pooling arrangements; a downgrade in the Company's claims-paying and financial strength ratings; the loss or significant restriction on the Company's ability to use credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal Lines policies; and amendments to, and changes to the risk-based capital requirements.
 
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

Reduced for known insolvencies.

The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience and current economic conditions.  Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at December 31, 2003, $5.3 billion or 81% were rated by A.M. Best and Company.  Of the total rated by A.M. Best and Company, 98% were rated A- or better.  The remaining 19% net recoverables from reinsurers comprised the following:  4% related to Equitas, 5% related to voluntary pools that the Company participates in, 4% related to captive insurance companies and 6% were other companies not rated by A.M. Best and Company.  In addition, $705.5 million of these net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at December 31, 2003.
 
During the first quarter of 2004, Travelers entered into an agreement to settle all current and future reinsurance claims against certain underwriters at Lloyds of London reinsured by Equitas.  Under terms of this settlement, Travelers received $245.0 million, resolving net claim balances of approximately $255.0 million from Equitas.  If federal asbestos reform legislation is enacted by the 108th U.S. Congress, Equitas may elect to recoup $150.0 million from Travelers and, if Equitas makes that election, the reinsurance agreements for asbestos coverage will be reinstated.  As a result, these funds are being held in trust, and the related reinsurance recoverables and reserves will remain on the balance sheet until the contingency is resolved.  There are no contingencies related to the remaining $95.0 million, which has been reflected as a reduction to the reinsurance recoverable as of March 31, 2004.
 
The Company's top five reinsurers by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2003 were as follows:
 
 
Our insurance subsidiaries are required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of that pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
Structured settlements are annuities purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so we reflect the amount as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.  Life insurers with current A.M. Best ratings of A- or better represented 97% of the balance at December 31, 2003.

nancial Measures
 
All information included in this Financial Supplement presents the historical, standalone results of Travelers as Travelers is treated as the accounting acquirer.  See the separately provided Financial Supplement for St. Paul which presents the historical, standalone results of St. Paul.
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  These measures are components of net income but, in some cases, are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income, and in some cases, require inclusion or exclusion of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in a GAAP financial measure.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations.
 
  Net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), income (or loss) from discontinued operations, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. 
Operating income and operating income per share:
 
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, net of tax.
Return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  In particular, net realized investment gains or losses are significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  In addition, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity internally to evaluate performance against historical results and established financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
The profit or loss experienced by a property casualty insurance company after deducting claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance related expenses from net earned premiums and fee income.  This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income. 
Underwriting gain or loss: 
 
Underwriting gain or loss measures the return on the Company's in force property casualty contracts and reflects the contribution of underwriting activities to earnings.  Underwriting gain or loss includes the effects of catastrophes and loss reserve development.
 
      A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
 - 
catastrophe
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 - 
      Loss reserve development
 
The Company uses to represent the contribution to earnings from current period underwriting (i.e., without development on business earned in prior periods) and the highly irregular effects of catastrophes.  A reconciliation of these measures to net income is provided on page 4.

Exhibit 99.3
 
 
April 28, 2004
 
 
To the investment community:
 
 
On April 1, 2004, The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul), completed its previously announced merger with Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (Travelers), forming The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers).  Each share of Travelers class A and class B common stock was exchanged for 0.4334 of a share of St. Paul Travelers common stock.  For accounting purposes, this transaction will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Travelers treated as the accounting acquirer.  Accordingly, the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase business combination, using Travelers historical financial information and applying fair value estimates to the acquired assets, liabilities, and commitments of St. Paul as of April 1, 2004.
 
All information included in this Financial Supplement presents the historical, standalone results of St. Paul.  See the separately provided Financial Supplement for St. Paul Travelers, which presents the historical, standalone results of Travelers, the accounting acquirer.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures have been used and reconciled to GAAP throughout this supplement.  To aid in this reconciliation, key terms and definitions are provided on page eighteen.

This financial supplement includes certain statutory reporting information, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.  The reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in accordance with the requirements of Regulation G under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  Non-GAAP financial measures are often not comparable among issuers, and are not a substitute for GAAP information.
 
U.S. property-liability insurance operations comprise the majority of our operations.  These operations are required under applicable state insurance legislation and regulations to publicly report information on the basis of Statutory Accounting Principles ("SAP"), including net written premiums, statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, and statutory underwriting expense ratio information.  This financial supplement provides selected SAP information for all of our property-liability underwriting operations, as well as certain GAAP information for such operations.  The types of SAP information included herein are common measures of the performance of a property-liability insurer, and we believe the inclusion of such information will aid investors in comparing our results with those of our peers in the industry.  In addition, management uses this SAP information to monitor financial performance.
 
Throughout this financial supplement, the company presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use this financial information in evaluating our performance. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net income, the company shows operating earnings, which is defined in this financial supplement.
 
Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of the company's insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process.  Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization.  In sum, realized capital gains or losses for any particular period
are not indicative of the performance of our underlying business operations.
 
Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it more difficult for users of our financial information to evaluate the company's success or failure in our basic business, and may lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions.  We understand that the equity analysts who follow the company focus on operating earnings in their analyses for the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph.
 
All financial results herein are unaudited as of the date of this release.
