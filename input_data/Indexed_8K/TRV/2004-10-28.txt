Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (October 27, 2004)
 
The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul Travelers" or the "Company", NYSE: STA) today reported net income of $340 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, or $0.51 per basic share and $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $426 million, or $0.98 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Net income for the current quarter included $402 million of after-tax catastrophe losses, compared to $83 million of after-tax catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.
 
The Company reported operating income of $372 million for the current quarter, or $0.56 per basic share and $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $442 million, or $1.02 per basic share and $1.01 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Excluding catastrophe losses, operating income for the current quarter was $774 million, or $1.16 per basic share and $1.12 per diluted share, compared to $525 million, or $1.21 per basic and $1.20 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Operating income excludes net realized investment gains (losses).
 
St. Paul Travelers was formed from the merger of Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (Travelers) and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul) on April 1, 2004.  All results presented for periods prior to the second quarter of 2004 reflect only the results of Travelers.
 
Highlights for the Current Quarter
 
 - 
                 
Return on equity of 6.7 percent, which was negatively impacted by 7.8 points from catastrophe losses.
 
 - 
                 
Net written premiums of $5.050 billion, up 50 percent from the prior year quarter and down 5 percent on a pro forma combined basis from the prior year quarter.
 
 - 
                 
GAAP combined ratio of 103.8 percent, which included 11.6 points for catastrophe losses.
 
 - 
                 
Continued strong growth in the Personal segment with net written premiums up 16 percent and operating income up 44 percent from the prior year quarter, despite an increase of $32 million after-tax for catastrophe losses between the two periods.
 
 
 - 
                 
Investment income of $514 million, up 5 percent, and average invested assets of $62 billion, up 3 percent, from the second quarter 2004.
 
 - 
                 
Favorable decision in ACandS asbestos litigation in which the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania denied ACandS's motion to vacate the previously announced arbitration award granted to Travelers and dismissed a related pending lawsuit by ACandS against Travelers asserting that each asbestos bodily injury claim is subject to a separate occurrence limit (appeal pending).  The impact of these rulings will be considered along with other information in the Company's annual review of asbestos reserves, which will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Jay Fishman, President and Chief Executive Officer of St. Paul Travelers, said, "While we are satisfied with the current operating results of our business, achieving operating income of $774 million excluding catastrophe losses, our top line in Commercial is behind prior year levels.  We have analyzed our business flow by market, product, region and agent.  Our results demonstrate that we are maintaining our existing business at historically strong levels and at attractive margins.  However, the new business we are currently writing is less than the prior year combined level.  We believe this is principally due to the increasingly competitive marketplace for new business, the impact of new business premiums from 2003 renewal rights transactions and our agents continuing to adjust their new business levels with us as we integrate to a common underwriting platform.
 
"Our Personal segment operations continue to show strong top and bottom line growth as we move forward with our pricing segmentation initiatives.  Within Specialty, we are continuing to grow in areas such as Technology, Public Sector and Ocean Marine and are being more selective in areas that are not meeting our return hurdles, such as Construction and personal lines at Lloyd's."

Net written premiums increased 50 percent to $5.050 billion from the prior year quarter.  The increase was due to the inclusion of St. Paul's net written premiums in the current quarter.  Net written premiums decreased 5 percent from the prior year quarter on a pro forma combined basis primarily due to lower new business in the Company's Commercial and Specialty segments and the planned non-renewal of certain commercial property and construction risks and a personal lines creditor insurance facility underwritten at Lloyd's.
 
The underwriting component of operating income, or underwriting gain (loss), decreased from a gain of $105 million after-tax ($135 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter, which did not include the results of St. Paul, to a loss of $155 million after-tax ($240 million pre-tax) in the current year quarter.  The decrease was primarily due to after-tax charges of $402 million ($612 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses and $51 million ($78 million pre-tax) for prior year reserve development for the current quarter compared to an after-tax charge of $83 million ($128 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses and an after-tax benefit of $9 million ($14 million pre-tax) for favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter catastrophe losses were primarily related to Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, which made landfall in the southeast United States during the quarter.  The prior year quarter catastrophe losses were primarily related to Hurricane Isabel.
 
Net investment income was $514 million after-tax ($667 million pre-tax), compared to $347 million after-tax ($458 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.  The increase primarily resulted from the inclusion of St. Paul's investment results in the current quarter.  In addition, increased net investment income resulting from strong operating cash flows was partially offset by lower average yields on fixed income securities and lower returns on alternative investments.
 
The GAAP combined ratio of 103.8 percent increased by 9.1 points from the prior year quarter primarily due to the effect of higher catastrophe losses.  The consolidated GAAP combined ratio included the impact of 11.6 points for catastrophe losses in the current quarter as compared to 4.1 points in the prior year quarter.
 
For the first nine months of 2004, St. Paul Travelers reported net income of $652 million, or $1.10 per basic share and $1.09 per diluted share, compared to $1.207 billion, or $2.78 per basic share and $2.76 per diluted share, in the prior year period.  Operating income for the first nine months was $676 million, or $1.14 per basic share and $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $1.212 billion, or $2.79 per basic share and $2.78 per diluted share, in the prior year period.  Net income and operating income in the current period included after-tax charges of $1.012 billion for prior year reserve development, $431 million for catastrophe losses and $26 million for merger related restructuring costs, compared to $106 million for prior year reserve development, $199 million for catastrophe losses and no restructuring costs in the prior year period.
 
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the second quarter of 2004: Commercial, Specialty, Personal and Asset Management.  Historical results have been restated to reflect the new segments.
 
 
For the third quarter of 2004, the Commercial segment reported operating income of $260 million, compared to $328 million in the prior year quarter, which did not include the results of St. Paul.  The impact of catastrophe losses in the current quarter was $184 million after-tax ($284 million pre-tax), compared to $23 million after-tax ($35 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.  Also impacting the current quarter operating income was a net after-tax charge of $34 million ($50 million pre-tax) for prior year reserve development, compared to an after-tax charge of $16 million ($24 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.  The Commercial GAAP combined ratio was 105.4 percent in the current quarter as compared to 93.6 percent in the prior year quarter.  Catastrophe losses for the current quarter impacted the GAAP combined ratio by 12.2 points compared to 2.2 points for the prior year quarter.
 
Pro forma combined net written premiums for the Commercial segment decreased by $387 million (16 percent) from the prior year quarter to $2.070 billion and by $267 million (12 percent) to $1.957 billion for core large, medium and small commercial businesses.  The decreases were due to lower new business, the impact of higher premium flow in 2003 associated with the Kemper renewal rights transaction and the planned non-renewal of certain commercial property risks.  Retention rates remained strong and consistent with prior quarters while renewal price changes continued to moderate to the low-single digit levels.
 
Pro forma combined net written premiums for non-core Commercial, which includes the results of Gulf and other run-off operations, decreased by $120 million (52 percent) from the prior year quarter, due to the planned non-renewal of written premiums for these businesses and $32 million of Gulf net written premiums transferred to the Financial and Professional Services line within Domestic Specialty.
 
 
Specialty Segment Financial Results
 
For the third quarter 2004, the Specialty segment reported operating income of $2 million compared to $51 million in the prior year quarter, which did not include the results of St. Paul.  The impact of catastrophe losses in the current quarter was $126 million after-tax ($186 million pre-tax), compared to no impact in the prior year quarter.  Also impacting the current quarter operating income was a net after-tax charge of $42 million ($65 million pre-tax) related to prior year reserve development, compared to no prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.  The Specialty GAAP combined ratio was 110.5 percent in the current quarter as compared to 90.4 percent in the prior year quarter.  Catastrophe losses for the quarter impacted the GAAP combined ratio by 12.3 points, compared to no impact in the prior year quarter.
 
Pro forma combined net written premiums decreased by $103 million (7 percent) to $1.408 billion from the prior year quarter.  Pro forma combined net written premiums for Domestic Specialty decreased by $46 million (4 percent) to $1.176 billion from the prior year quarter.  The decrease was predominately due to disciplined underwriting in Construction, which resulted in a decrease of $48 million of net written premiums.  Domestic Specialty retention rates remained strong and were consistent with prior quarters, and renewal price changes continued to moderate to the mid-single digit levels.
 
Pro forma combined net written premiums for International Specialty, which includes operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada and business written through Lloyd's, decreased by $57 million (20 percent) to $232 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the non-renewal of a personal lines creditor insurance facility underwritten at Lloyd's.  Excluding Lloyd's, International Specialty retention levels remained strong and renewal price changes continued to moderate to the low-single digit levels.
 
 
Personal Segment Financial Results
 
For the third quarter 2004, the Personal segment reported operating income of $127 million, compared to $88 million in the prior year quarter.  This increase of 44 percent was primarily due to growth in business volumes in all lines, the continued favorable rate environment and the benefit of declining current accident year non-catastrophe related property claim frequency, partially offset by increased catastrophe losses.  The current quarter results included $92 million after-tax ($142 million pre-tax) of catastrophe losses and an after-tax benefit of $25 million ($37 million pre-tax) from favorable prior year reserve development. This compares to an after-tax charge of $60 million ($92 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses and an after-tax benefit of $25 million ($38 million pre-tax) for favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.  The Personal GAAP combined ratio was 94.0 percent in the current quarter as compared to 97.3 percent in the prior year quarter.  Catastrophe losses for the quarter impacted the GAAP combined ratio by 9.9 points compared to 7.5 points for the prior year quarter.
 
Third quarter net written premiums increased by $216 million (16 percent) compared to the prior year quarter due to strong organic growth, new business premiums from the Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction, strong retention and continued increases in premium rates in both the Automobile and the Homeowners and Other lines of business.
 
Automobile net written premiums increased by 11 percent to $884 million compared to the prior year quarter.  Policies in force rose for the 14th consecutive quarter, increasing by 11 percent from the prior year quarter, while renewal price changes remained in the mid-single digits.
 
Homeowners and Other net written premiums increased in the current quarter by 23 percent to $688 million from the prior year quarter.  Policies in force rose for the ninth consecutive quarter, increasing by 14 percent from the prior year quarter, while renewal price changes remained in the high single digits.
The Asset Management segment is comprised of the Company's 79 percent interest in Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen").  Nuveen's core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high-net-worth and institutional market segments.
 
Operating income for the Asset Management segment, net of minority interest, was $29 million for the current quarter. Total revenues were $132 million for the current quarter and assets under management were $106.9 billion at the end of the third quarter.

Glossary of Financial Measures
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
Operating income and operating income per share
is net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and on a per share basis.
 
Return on equity
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on investment securities, net of tax.
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share, and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
Underwriting gain or loss
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.  This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income.
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
Loss reserve development
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 
GAAP combined ratio
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premium. A GAAP combined ratio under 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
 
Pro forma
reflect the addition of net written premiums of St. Paul and Travelers for periods prior to the merger. The pro forma combined net written premium amounts are not affected by purchase accounting adjustments. Net written premiums are a measure of business volume.  The pro forma information presented is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition and related transactions been made on the dates indicated, or of future results of the Company.
combined net written premiums
 
Adjusted book value per share
represents assets less liabilities excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's
management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property-casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the second quarter 2004:
 
Commercial:
offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services and is organized into the following three marketing and underwriting groups focusing on a particular client base or product grouping to provide products and services that specifically address clients' needs: Commercial Accounts, Select Accounts and National Accounts. includes policies written by Gulf, primarily management and professional liability coverages (prior to the integration of these products into Specialty in April 2004), the Special Liability Group and runoff operations.
Commercial  Core
Commercial - Other
 
Specialty
provides dedicated underwriting, claim and risk control services that require specialized expertise, domestically and internationally.  Domestic Specialty includes Financial and Professional Services, Bond, Construction, Technology, Ocean Marine, Oil and Gas, Public Sector and Excess & Umbrella, among others.  International Specialty includes operations in the U.K, Ireland, Canada and the Company's participation in Lloyd's.
 
Personal
writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks.  The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
 
Asset Management
comprises Nuveen Investments, whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments.  The Company holds a 79 percent interest in Nuveen Investments.
 
* * * * *
Prior quarter segment results have been restated from the historical presentation of Travelers to conform to the new St. Paul Travelers segment arrangement where practicable.  As a result, prior quarter Bond and Construction results were disaggregated from historical Travelers Commercial Lines segment to create a historical Specialty segment and to restate Commercial into the new format.
 
Invested and other assets and net investment income (NII) of historical Travelers had been specifically identified by reporting segment prior to the merger.  Beginning in the second quarter 2004, the Company developed a methodology to allocate NII and invested assets to the identified segments.  This methodology allocates pre-tax NII based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment.  It is not practicable to apply the methodology to historical businesses and as such, actual (versus allocated) NII is included in revenues and operating income of the restated segments for periods prior to the merger.  It is also not practicable to present total assets for restated Specialty and Commercial segments for periods prior to the merger.  The Company believes that the differences, if any, are not significant to a comparison with the new segment presentation.

Reinsurance Recoverables
($ in millions) 
 
 
The gross reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.
 
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all current and future reinsurance claims against certain underwriters at Lloyds of London reinsured by Equitas.Under terms of this settlement, the Company received $245 million, resolving approximately $255 million of Travelers' net claim balances from Equitas.If federal asbestos reform legislation is enacted by the 108th U.S. Congress, Equitas may elect to recoup $150 million from Travelers and, if Equitas makes that election, the reinsurance agreements for asbestos coverage will be reinstated.As a result, these funds are being held in trust, and the related reinsurance recoverables and reserves will remain on the balance sheet until the contingency is resolved.There are no contingencies related to the remaining $95 million, which has been reflected as a reduction to the reinsurance recoverable.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with a reinsurer to settle all current and future reinsurance claims related to various treaty reinsurance programs.This commutation agreement resolves $1.069 billion in net claim balances from this reinsurer and has been reflected as a reduction in the reinsurance recoverable.In addition to the commutation, the Company entered into a new reinsurance agreement covering the 2000 accident year for the former St. Paul companies on an aggregate basis.

Financial Supplement - Third Quarter 2004
 
All historical information through the first quarter of 2004 included in this Financial Supplement presents only results of Travelers as Travelers is being treated as the accounting acquirer. Where applicable, historical results conform with current business segment definitions.
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. These measures are components of net income but, in some cases, are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, require inclusion or exclusion of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in a GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
is net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and on a per share basis.
Operating income and operating income per share
 
is the ratio of net income to average equity. is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, net of tax.
Return on equity
Operating return on adjusted equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results. These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Internally the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and established financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
is the profit or loss experienced by a property casualty company after deducting claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses from net earned premiums and fee income. This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income.
Underwriting gain or loss
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
 
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned. For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums. The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premium. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
 
combined net written premium reflects the addition of net written premiums of the St. Paul and Travelers for periods prior to the merger. The pro forma combined net written premium amounts are not affected by purchase accounting adjustments. Net written premiums are a measure of business volume. The pro forma information presented is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition and related transactions been made on the dates indicated, or of future results of the Company.
Pro forma
 
represents assets less liabilities excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding.  In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a preperty-casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the second quarter 2004:

Prior quarter segments have been restated from the historical presentation of Travelers to conform to the new St. Paul Travelers segment arrangement where practicable. As a result, prior quarter Bond and Construction results were disaggregated from historical Travelers Commercial Lines segment to create a historical Specialty segment and to restate Commercial into the new format.
 
Invested and other assets and net investment income (NII) of historical Travelers had been specifically identified by reporting segment prior to the merger. Beginning in the second quarter 2004, the Company developed a methodology to allocate NII and invested assets to the identified segments. This methodology allocates pretax NII based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. It is not practicable to apply the methodology to historical businesses and as such, actual (versus allocated) NII is included in revenues and operating income of the restated segments for periods prior to the merger. It is also not practicable to present total assets for restated Specialty and Commercial segments for periods prior to the merger. The Company believes that the differences, if any, are not significant to a comparison with the new segment presentation.
