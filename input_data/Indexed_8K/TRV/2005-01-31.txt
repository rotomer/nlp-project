NEWS RELEASE
 
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (January 31, 2005)
 
The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul Travelers," NYSE: STA) today reported net income of $303 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, or $0.45 per basic share and $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $489 million, or $1.13 per basic share and $1.09 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Operating income for the current quarter was $307 million, or $0.46 per basic share and $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $463 million, or $1.07 per basic share and $1.04 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Operating income excludes net realized investment gains (losses).  The St. Paul Companies, Inc. ("The St. Paul") and Travelers Property Casualty Corp. ("Travelers") merged to form St. Paul Travelers on April 1, 2004.  The periods prior to April 1, 2004 do not include the results of The St. Paul.  Average diluted shares outstanding were 708.6 million for the quarter, which included the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt due to the adoption of new accounting requirements.
 
The company also announced its intentions to explore strategic alternatives to divest its 79% equity stake in Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen") and to combine its major insurance pools.
 
Highlights for the Quarter
 
Record operating income of $378 million in the Personal segment, including $169 million after-tax of favorable prior and current year reserve development.
 - 
                 
 
Strong investment performance.
 - 
                 
 
Net written premiums of $5.154 billion, up 52 percent from prior year quarter (down 1 percent on a pro forma combined basis).
 - 
                 
 
Pre-tax reserve increases of $922 million for asbestos and $84 million for environmental related claims, both of which resulted in an after-tax charge of $673 million.
 - 
                 
Pre-tax catastrophe losses of $113 million ($78 million after-tax) related to the third quarter hurricanes in the Commercial and Specialty segments
 - 
                 
 
Net and operating income for the current quarter included an after-tax benefit of $117 million ($180 million pre-tax) due to favorable claim activity that resulted in a re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters in the Personal and Commercial segments.  Net and operating income was also impacted by an after-tax benefit of $91 million ($140 million pre-tax) due to favorable prior year reserve development in the Personal segment.  In addition, the company recorded a $78 million after-tax charge ($113 million pre-tax) in the current quarter due to catastrophe losses in the Commercial and Specialty segments related to the third quarter hurricanes.
 
Jay Fishman, President and Chief Executive Officer of St. Paul Travelers, said, "We generated solid underlying earnings in the fourth quarter, aided by strong investment income and favorable non-catastrophe-related weather.  Expense savings initiatives are generally ahead of schedule and we are confident that we will achieve our original pre-tax goal of a $350 million annual run-rate savings by the end of 2005 and $450 million by the end of 2006.  With the steps taken in 2004, and the initiatives planned for the future, we are well positioned to realize our earnings power in 2005 and beyond.
 
"We are particularly pleased with the performance in our Personal segment, which generated record operating income and net written premium growth of 13% over the prior year quarter.  In our commercial businesses, profitability before the asbestos and environmental charge was solid, net written premium levels improved modestly over the third quarter and renewal retentions remain strong with modest price increases across the book.  As we approach the first anniversary of our merger, our underwriting orientation and appetite have become increasingly clear to the marketplace and our agents remain very supportive.
 
"A divestiture of our equity stake in Nuveen would significantly increase our financial flexibility, operating company capital and tangible net worth.  Nuveen is a wonderful franchise with an outstanding track record and a great management team.  We are working closely with the Nuveen management to facilitate a smooth transition and are focused on ensuring the continuation of their exciting prospects."
 
Note: Results prior to the second quarter 2004 reflect only the results of Travelers
Please see Glossary of Financial Measures for definitions and the statistical supplement for additional financial data
 
Net written premiums increased 52 percent to $5.154 billion from the prior year quarter.  The increase was due to the inclusion of The St. Paul's net written premiums in the current quarter.  Net written premiums decreased 1 percent from the prior year quarter on a pro forma combined basis primarily due to lower new business in the company's Commercial segment.
 
Net investment income for the current quarter was $562 million after-tax ($735 million pre-tax), which was positively impacted by returns on alternative investments and strong operating cash flows.
 
The current quarter GAAP combined ratio of 107.1 percent included 16.5 points for prior year reserve strengthening and 2.1 points for catastrophe losses.  Favorable current year reserve development reduced the current quarter GAAP combined ratio by 3.4 points.
 
Results of Asbestos Review
 
The asbestos reserve increase of $922 million in the current quarter included an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, state judicial rulings and legislative actions.  The increase resulted primarily from changes in the asbestos landscape over the last two years and was largely driven by an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants.  The company has settled or has had favorable rulings on large case exposures and has not seen any significant exposures arising from policyholders submitting asbestos claims for the first time.  While the company continues to support efforts for asbestos reform, the reserving actions do not contemplate any significant future legislative developments.
For the full year 2004, St. Paul Travelers reported net income of $955 million, or $1.56 per basic share and $1.53 per diluted share, compared to $1.696 billion, or $3.91 per basic share and $3.80 per diluted share, in the prior year.  Operating income for the full year was $983 million, or $1.61 per basic share and $1.58 per diluted share, compared to $1.675 billion, or $3.86 per basic share and $3.75 per diluted share, in the prior year.  Net and operating income for the year included after-tax charges of $1.594 billion for prior year reserve development, $511 million due to catastrophe losses and $19 million for merger related restructuring costs.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2004, the Commercial segment reported an operating loss of $192 million.  These results included after-tax charges of $673 million ($1.006 billion pre-tax) for asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening and $49 million ($74 million pre-tax) due to adverse development on the third quarter hurricane losses.  The current quarter was also impacted by an after-tax benefit of $39 million ($60 million pre-tax) due to favorable claim activity that resulted in a re-estimation of the current year loss ratio for the first three quarters.
 
The Commercial GAAP combined ratio was 136.0 percent in the current quarter.  Prior year reserve strengthening increased the GAAP combined ratio by 44.5 points and catastrophe losses added 3.3 points.  Favorable current year reserve development reduced the combined ratio by 2.7 points.
 
Pro forma combined net written premiums for the Commercial segment decreased 11 percent from the prior year quarter to $2.148 billion.  Commercial Core pro forma combined net written premiums decreased 9 percent to $2.068 billion.  The decreases were primarily due to lower new business resulting from increased competition and the impact of higher premium flow in the prior year quarter associated with the Royal & SunAlliance, Kemper and Atlantic Mutual renewal rights transactions.  Retention rates, new business levels and renewal price changes were consistent with the third quarter, and net written premiums increased modestly from the third quarter.
 
Pro forma combined net written premiums for Commercial Other, which includes the results of Gulf and other run-off operations, decreased 43 percent from the prior year quarter due to the planned non-renewal of written premiums for these businesses.  Approximately $42 million of net written premiums previously written by Gulf were written by Domestic Specialty in the current quarter.
 
Specialty Segment Financial Results
 
For the fourth quarter 2004, the Specialty segment reported operating income of $140 million.  These results included an after-tax charge of $29 million ($39 million pre-tax) due to adverse development on the third quarter hurricanes and a related reinsurance reinstatement premium.  The Specialty GAAP combined ratio was 100.3 percent in the current quarter, which included 2.6 points for catastrophe losses.
 
Specialty pro forma combined net written premiums increased 3 percent from the prior year quarter to $1.573 billion.  Pro forma combined net written premiums for Domestic
Specialty increased 4 percent to $1.252 billion, including the $42 million of former Gulf business described above.  Several businesses within Domestic Specialty experienced solid growth, such as 9 percent in Financial and Professional Services excluding premiums transferred from Gulf, 10 percent in Bond, 7 percent in Technology, 16 percent in Oil and Gas, and 37 percent in Ocean Marine, while Construction declined 10 percent due to continued disciplined underwriting.  Domestic Specialty retention rates and new business levels were consistent with prior 2004 quarters while renewal price changes increased to the high single digits.  Fourth quarter net written premiums increased modestly from the third quarter.
 
Pro forma combined net written premiums for International Specialty decreased 4 percent from the prior year quarter to $321 million primarily due to a reinsurance reinstatement premium incurred as a result of additional losses related to the third quarter hurricanes and the planned non-renewal of certain personal lines business at Lloyd's.  Excluding Lloyd's, retention levels remained strong, new business levels were consistent with prior 2004 quarters and renewal price changes were in the low single digits.
 
Personal Segment Financial Results
 
For the fourth quarter 2004, the Personal segment reported record operating income of $378 million, compared to $185 million in the prior year quarter.  This increase of 104 percent was primarily due to the benefit of favorable prior and current year claim frequency, the continued favorable rate environment and growth in business volumes in all lines.  The current quarter results included benefits of $91 million ($140 million pre-tax) due to favorable prior year reserve development and $78 million after-tax ($120 million pre-tax) due to favorable claim activity that resulted in a re-estimation of the current year loss ratio for the first three quarters.  This compares to after-tax benefits of $66 million ($102 million pre-tax) of favorable prior year reserve development and $32 million ($49 million pre-tax) of favorable current year reserve development in the prior year quarter.  The Personal GAAP combined ratio was 69.7 percent in the current quarter as compared to 85.6 percent in the prior year quarter.  Favorable current and prior year reserve development for the quarter reduced the GAAP combined ratio by 17.6 points compared to a reduction of 12.0 points in the prior year quarter.
 
Fourth quarter net written premiums increased 13 percent from the prior year quarter to $1.433 billion due to strong organic growth, new business premiums from the Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction, solid retention and continued increases in premium rates in both the Automobile and the Homeowners and Other lines of business.
 
Automobile net written premiums increased 9 percent from the prior year quarter to $810 million.  Policies in force rose for the fifteenth consecutive quarter, increasing 9 percent from the prior year quarter, while renewal price changes remained in the mid-single digits.
 
Homeowners and Other net written premiums increased 20 percent from the prior year quarter to $623 million.  Policies in force rose for the tenth consecutive quarter, increasing 15 percent from the prior year quarter, while renewal price changes remained in the high single digits.
The Asset Management segment is comprised of the company's 79 percent interest in Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen").  Nuveen's core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high-net-worth and institutional market segments.
 
Operating income for the Asset Management segment, net of minority interest, was $32 million for the current quarter. Total revenues were $137 million for the current quarter and assets under management grew to a record $115 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.

Glossary of Financial Measures
 
The following measures are used by the company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the company's financial performance.
 
is net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and on a per share basis.
Operating income and operating income per share
 
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on investment securities, net of tax.
Return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the company's management, operating income, operating income per share, and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.  This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income.
Underwriting gain or loss
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
 
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premium. A GAAP combined ratio under 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
 
reflect the addition of net written premiums of The St. Paul and Travelers for periods prior to the merger on April 1, 2004. The pro forma combined net written premium amounts are not affected by purchase accounting adjustments. Net written premiums are a measure of business volume.  The pro forma information presented is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition and related transactions been made at the beginning of the applicable period, or of future results of the company.
Pro forma
combined net written premiums
represents assets less liabilities excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property-casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the second quarter 2004:
 
offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services and is organized into the following three marketing and underwriting groups focusing on a particular client base or product grouping to provide products and services that specifically address clients' needs: Commercial Accounts, Select Accounts and National Accounts. includes policies written by Gulf, primarily management and professional liability coverages (prior to the integration of these products into Specialty in April 2004), the Special Liability Group and runoff operations.
Commercial:
Commercial  Core
Commercial - Other
 
provides dedicated underwriting, claim and risk control services that require specialized expertise, domestically and internationally.  Domestic Specialty includes Financial and Professional Services, Bond, Construction, Technology, Ocean Marine, Oil and Gas, Public Sector and Excess & Umbrella, among others.  International Specialty includes operations in the U.K, Ireland, Canada and the company's participation in Lloyd's.
Specialty
 
writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks.  The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
Personal
 
comprises Nuveen Investments, whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments.  The company holds a 79 percent interest in Nuveen Investments.
Asset Management
 
* * * * *
 
Segment results for periods beginning prior to April 1, 2004 have been restated from the historical presentation of Travelers to conform to the new St. Paul Travelers segment arrangement where practicable.  As a result, prior quarter Bond and Construction results were disaggregated from historical Travelers Commercial Lines segment to create a historical Specialty segment and to restate Commercial into the new format.
 
Invested and other assets and net investment income (NII) of historical Travelers had been specifically identified by reporting segment prior to the merger.  Beginning in the second quarter 2004, the company developed a methodology to allocate NII and invested assets to the identified segments.  This methodology allocates pre-tax NII based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment.  It is not practicable to apply the methodology to historical businesses and as such, actual (versus allocated) NII is included in revenues and operating income of the restated segments for periods prior to the merger.  It is also not practicable to present total assets for restated Specialty and Commercial segments for periods prior to the merger.  The company believes that the differences, if any, are not significant to a comparison with the new segment presentation.
 
Forward Looking Statements
 
This press release may contain, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, the company may make forward-looking statements about the company's results of operations (including, among others, premium volume and net and operating income), financial condition and liquidity; the sufficiency of the company's asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the post-merger integration (including, among others, expense savings); and strategic initiatives (including, among others, the sale of the company's interest in Nuveen).  Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: adverse developments involving asbestos claims and related litigation; the impact of aggregate policy coverage limits for asbestos claims; the impact of bankruptcies of various asbestos producers and related businesses; the willingness of parties including the company to settle asbestos-related litigation; the company's ability to fully integrate the former St. Paul and Travelers businesses in the manner or in the timeframe currently anticipated; the company's ability to execute announced and future strategic initiatives as planned; insufficiency of, or changes in, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves; the company's inability to obtain prices sought due to competition or otherwise; the occurrence of catastrophic events, both natural and man-made, including terrorist acts, with a severity or frequency exceeding the company's expectations; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, environmental claims and related litigation; the impact of claims related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, including, but not limited to, lead paint, silica and other potentially harmful substances; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures in medical costs and auto and building repair costs; the effects of corporate bankruptcies on surety bond claims; adverse developments in the cost, availability and/or ability to collect reinsurance; the ability of the company's subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; adverse developments in legal proceedings; judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability; the impact of legislative and other governmental actions, including, but not limited to, federal and state legislation related to asbestos liability reform and governmental actions regarding the compensation of brokers and agents; the performance of the company's investment portfolios, which could be adversely impacted by adverse developments in U.S. and global and financial markets, interest rates and rates of inflation; weakening U.S. and global economic conditions; larger than expected assessments for guaranty funds and mandatory pooling arrangements; a downgrade in the company's claims-paying and financial strength ratings; the loss or significant restriction on the company's ability to use credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal policies; and changes to the regulatory capital requirements.
 
The company's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release or as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.

Reinsurance Recoverables
($ in millions)
 
 
The Company's top five reinsurers,  including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2004 is as follows:
 
 
* Brackets indicate retroactive balance that is included in the 12/31/04 total.
 
The gross reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.
 
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all current and future reinsurance claims against certain underwriters at Lloyds of London reinsured by Equitas.  Under terms of this settlement, the Company received $245 million, resolving approximately $255 million of Travelers' net claim balances from Equitas.  If federal asbestos reform legislation was enacted by the 108th U.S. Congress, Equitas could have elected to recoup $150 million from Travelers and, if Equitas made that election, the reinsurance agreements for asbestos coverage would have been reinstated. Those funds were held in trust, and the related reinsurance recoverables and reserves remained on the balance sheet until the contingency was resolved at the end of the fourth quarter when Equitas released the funds in trust to the Company.  At the end of the fourth quarter, the entire $255 million was reflected as a reduction to the reinsurance recoverable.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with a reinsurer to settle all current and future reinsurance claims related to various treaty reinsurance programs.  This commutation agreement resolves $1.069 billion in net claim balances from this reinsurer and has been reflected as a reduction in the reinsurance recoverable.  In addition to the commutation, the Company entered into a new reinsurance agreement covering the 2000 accident year for the former St. Paul companies on an aggregate basis.

Financial Supplement - Fourth Quarter 2004
 
All historical information through the first quarter of 2004 included in this Financial Supplement presents only results of Travelers as Travelers is being treated as the accounting acquirer.  Where applicable, historical results conform with current business segment definitions.
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
is net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and on a per share basis.
Operating income and operating income per share
 
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, net of tax.
Return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
is the net earned premiums and the fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.  This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income.
Underwriting gain or loss
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
 
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premium. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
 
reflects the addition of net written premiums of The St. Paul and Travelers for periods prior to the merger on April 1, 2004. The pro forma combined net written premium amounts are not affected by purchase accounting adjustments. Net written premiums are a measure of business volume.  The pro forma information presented is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition and related transactions been made on the beginning of the applicable period, or of future results of the Company.
Pro forma combined net written premiums
 
represents assets less liabilities excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding.  In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property-casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the second quarter 2004:

Segment results for periods beginnig prior to April 1, 2004 have been restated from the historical presentation of  Travelers to conform to the new St. Paul Travelers segment arrangement where practicable.  As a result, prior quarter Bond and Construction results were disaggregated from historical Travelers Commercial Lines segment to create a historical Specialty segment and to restate Commercial into the new format. 
 
Invested and other assets and net investment income (NII) of historical Travelers had been specifically identified by reporting segment prior to the merger.  Beginning in the second quarter 2004, the Company developed a methodology to allocate NII and invested assets to the identified  segments.  This methodology allocates pretax NII based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment.  It is not practicable to apply the methodology to historical businesses and as such, actual (versus allocated) NII is included in revenues and operating income of the restated segments for periods prior to the merger.  It is also not practicable to present total assets for restated Specialty and Commercial segments for periods prior to the merger.  The Company believes that the differences, if any, are not significant to a comparison with the new segment presentation.
