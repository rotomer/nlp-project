Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a separation agreement as of January 30, 2005 (the "Agreement") with Douglas Elliot, Chief Executive Officer of General Commercial and Personal Lines for the Company. In connection with his separation from the Company, which was effective February 1, 2005 (the "Separation Date"), Mr. Elliot will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment of $5.5 million, which is approximately equivalent to three times his total annual compensation. Mr. Elliot's separation from the Company will be treated so as to preserve, to the maximum extent available under the terms of the governing agreements, Mr. Elliot's interest in certain shares of restricted stock that he held on the Separation Date. Mr. Elliot will also be eligible to receive pension benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Travelers Property Casualty Corp. Pension Plan. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will also continue to provide Mr. Elliot certain health and insurance benefits for up to three years after the Separation Date, unless Mr. Elliot becomes employed by a new employer and is eligible to receive such benefits from such new employer. In addition, Mr. Elliot has agreed to certain covenants, including, among others, covenants restricting solicitation of the Company's employees and customers for a period of 12 months after the Separation Date. The Agreement also contains a customary release of any claims that Mr. Elliot may have against the Company.
