Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On March 16, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (the "Company") established the maximum awards payable to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman and the three other most highly compensated executive officers of the Company (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers") under The St. Paul Travelers Senior Executive Performance Plan (the "Plan"). The maximum awards for the 2005 fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of the incentive pool payable under the Plan to each Named Executive Officer, are as follows: Chief Executive Officer 35% Chairman 25% First & Second Other Most Highly Compensated Executives 15% Third Other Most Highly Compensated Executive 10% If the Company's financial results for 2005 result in a bonus pool available for distribution to each Named Executive Officer under the Plan, the Compensation Committee will decide what, if any, portion of each Named Executive Officer's maximum allocation should be paid as a bonus. Incentive payments will be based on 2005 financial performance and short- and long-term performance factors which might include, among other factors, progress on the integration of The St. Paul Companies, Inc. and Travelers Property Casualty Corp. following the merger of the two companies on April 1, 2004 and progress on achieving post-merger expense reductions. This information should be read in conjunction with the Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.
