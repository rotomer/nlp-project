[ST. PAUL TRAVELERS LOGO] [NUVEEN INVESTMENTS LOGO] Nuveen Investments and St. Paul Travelers Announce Plans For the Sale of St. Paul Travelers' Stake in Nuveen CHICAGO, IL and SAINT PAUL, MN - March 25, 2005 -- Nuveen Investments, Inc. (NYSE: JNC), and The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: STA), announced today that St. Paul Travelers is implementing a program to sell its equity interest in Nuveen Investments. The program has three parts: o St. Paul Travelers will sell 39.6 million Nuveen shares, exclusive of an underwriters' over-allotment option, through a public secondary offering. Nuveen Investments will be filing a prospectus supplement for the secondary offering; o Additionally, Nuveen Investments intends to repurchase $600 million of Nuveen shares from St. Paul Travelers at the price of the secondary offering, net of the underwriters' discount; and o Finally, St. Paul Travelers will enter into forward sale agreements with affiliates of Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, with respect to its remaining equity interest in Nuveen Investments, or approximately 13.5 million shares. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley will in turn each issue public securities mandatorily exchangeable into shares of Nuveen. The objective of the transactions is for St. Paul Travelers to sell its entire interest in Nuveen Investments, resulting in Nuveen Investments becoming a fully independent, publicly traded company.
