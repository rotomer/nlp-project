Repurchase Agreement
.
 
On March 29, 2005, Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen") and The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul Travelers") entered into a stock repurchase agreement (the "Repurchase Agreement") providing for the repurchase by Nuveen of shares of its common stock held by St. Paul Travelers.
 
St. Paul Travelers and its subsidiaries collectively hold 73,325,214 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Nuveen (the "Nuveen Class B common stock"), which are convertible into an identical number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Nuveen (the "Nuveen Class A common stock"), at the option of the holder, and 81,510 shares of Class A common stock, currently representing in the aggregate approximately 78% of the total outstanding capital stock of Nuveen.  Nuveen has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") with respect to, among other things, the sale of shares of Nuveen Class A common stock by St. Paul Travelers, which Registration Statement was subsequently declared effective by the Commission.  Nuveen has filed preliminary prospectus supplements relating to an underwritten public stock offering of Class A common stock owned by St. Paul Travelers and to an offering of shares of Nuveen Class A common stock underlying mandatorily exchangeable securities to be issued and sold by certain affiliates of the underwriters in the underwritten public stock offering.
 
The Repurchase Agreement provides that, simultaneous with the closing of the underwritten public stock offering referred to above, Nuveen will repurchase from St. Paul Travelers shares of Nuveen Class B common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million (such repurchase the "Closing Repurchase").
In addition, Nuveen has agreed in the Repurchase Agreement that, on a future date determined as described below, but in any case on or before December 23, 2005, it will repurchase additional shares of Nuveen common stock from St. Paul Travelers for an aggregate purchase price of $400 million, plus interest at an annual rate of 3.5% less any dividends paid or payable to St. Paul Travelers on those shares (such forward repurchase, the "Forward Repurchase"). The purchase price per share to be paid by Nuveen in respect of both the Closing Repurchase and the Forward Repurchase will be equal to the net proceeds per share received by St. Paul Travelers in the underwritten public stock offering, subject to a negotiated cap of $40 per share.
 
The timing of the settlement of the Forward Repurchase is dependent upon Nuveen's receipt of approvals from
shareholders of funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (such funds, the "Registered Funds"), of new investment advisory agreements with relevant Nuveen advisory subsidiaries (such approvals, the "Fund Approvals"), but regardless of what Fund Approvals are received, the settlement of the Forward Repurchase will occur no later than December 23, 2005.  Nuveen has agreed in the Repurchase Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Fund Approvals, and St. Paul Travelers has agreed to reimburse Nuveen for its expenses in doing so.  If Fund Approvals have been received from 90% of assets under management in the Registered Funds prior to August 25, 2005, or 80% of assets under management in the Registered Funds on or after August 25, 2005, the Forward Repurchase will be settled five business days following the satisfaction of either percentage condition (we refer to the earlier of this date and December 23, 2005, as the "Settlement Date").  If the Fund Approvals
condition is not satisfied, the Settlement Date will be December 23, 2005, and St. Paul Travelers will be required to deliver shares of Nuveen Class A common stock borrowed or acquired in open market purchases in settlement of the Forward Repurchase, while retaining an equal number of shares of Nuveen Class B common stock until December 27, 2005.
 
St. Paul Travelers agreed in the Repurchase Agreement to retain ownership of shares of Nuveen Class B common stock constituting more than 25% of the voting securities of Nuveen until the Settlement Date.  Following the Settlement Date, St. Paul Travelers has no obligation to continue holding its shares of Nuveen common stock and may sell or transfer these shares at any time thereafter.
 
Also as part of the Repurchase Agreement, St. Paul Travelers agreed that, in the event it ceases to hold at least 25% of the voting securities of Nuveen, it will convert its remaining shares of Nuveen Class B common stock to Nuveen Class A common stock.  As a result, St. Paul Travelers would cease to have special governance rights associated with shares of Nuveen Class B common stock under Nuveen's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including director appointment rights and veto rights over common stock issuances, by-law amendments and amendments to Nuveen's Restated Certificate of Incorporation).
 
The closing and settlement of the repurchase transactions are contingent upon
customary terms and conditions.
 
The Repurchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Separation Agreement
.
 
On April 1, 2005, Nuveen entered into a Separation Agreement with St. Paul Travelers that addresses the separation of the parties following the completion of the underwritten public stock offering described above.  Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, the parties agreed to cooperate with, and provide indemnification to, each other on certain tax matters, including with respect to a restoration election under the Internal Revenue Code and in respect of Illinois state corporate income taxes paid on a unitary basis for periods prior to the separation.  The parties also agreed to cooperate following the separation with respect to providing necessary information about each other, and Nuveen agreed to use reasonable efforts to provide St. Paul Travelers with information necessary for St. Paul Travelers' legal and regulatory filings.  St. Paul Travelers agreed to reimburse Nuveen for its out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with the underwritten public stock offering and associated transactions, including, among other things, printing and filing fees, professional fees, and incremental mailing costs of notices required to be sent to other fund clients. St. Paul Travelers also agreed to use best efforts to obtain and maintain directors and officers insurance coverage, at no cost to Nuveen, for six years on behalf of Nuveen for occurrences prior to the time that Nuveen ceases to be a subsidiary of St. Paul Travelers, and certain related agreements.
 
The Separation Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the transactions contemplated under the Separation Agreement, Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers separately agreed to terminate the $250 million revolving loan agreement, as amended, between the parties.  No amounts were drawn under such facility as of the date of termination.

Tax Indemnification
(1)          Parent agrees that it shall be liable for and indemnify the Company and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, managers, members, partners and representatives (collectively, ""), and hold them harmless from, (A) all liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Illinois (together with any interest, penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts imposed with respect thereto) (collectively, "") that would not have been incurred but for the filing of one or more Unitary Returns, (B) all liability for Taxes imposed on the Subgroup (or any member thereof) solely as a result of a determination by a governmental authority (pursuant to an audit, litigation, or other proceeding) to the effect that the members of the Subgroup were not permitted to join in the filing of one or more Unitary Returns, and (C) all reasonable professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any audit, investigation or other proceeding with respect to items (A) or (B).  For purposes of item (A) of the preceding sentence, it shall be assumed that the members of the Subgroup were permitted to file a unitary Illinois State corporate income tax return for all Applicable Tax Years, except to the extent that there has been a determination by a governmental authority to the contrary.
Representatives

(2)          Notwithstanding Section 1(b)(1), Parent shall not be liable for, and the Company shall be liable for and indemnify Parent and its Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives, and hold them harmless from, (A) all liability for Taxes to the extent that such Taxes result from the provision by the Company or its Representatives of inaccurate information regarding the business results of the Subgroup in connection with the filing of Unitary Returns and (B) all reasonable professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any audit, investigation or other proceeding with respect to item (A).
(c)          .  Following the filing of the Unitary Return for the 2004 tax year, Parent and the Company shall determine whether true-up payments are required with respect to such Unitary Return.  If the amount previously paid by the Company to Parent with respect to the 2004 tax year (including pursuant to Section 1(a) hereof) is greater than the excess of the Separate Return Tax (as defined below) for such tax year over the SPCI Unitary Group (as defined below) tax for such tax year (based on the final Unitary Return), Parent shall pay the difference to the Company within seven (7) business days after the final Unitary Return for the 2004 tax year is filed.  If the amount previously paid by the Company to Parent with respect to the 2004 tax year (including pursuant to Section 1(a) hereof) is less than the excess of the Separate Return Tax for such tax year over the SPCI Unitary Group tax for such tax year (based on the final Unitary Tax return), the Company shall pay the difference to Parent within seven (7) business days after the final Unitary Return for the 2004 tax year is filed.

(d)          .  With respect to each Applicable Taxable Year, the Company shall, taking into account all payments previously made with respect to such Applicable Tax Year (including those made pursuant to Section 1(a) and 1(c) hereof), pay to Parent the excess (if any) of the Separate Return Tax over the SPCI Unitary Tax, and Parent shall, taking into account all payments previously made with respect to such Applicable Tax Year (including those made pursuant to Section 1(a) and 1(c) hereof), pay to the Company the excess (if any) of the SPCI Unitary Tax over the Separate Return Tax.  If any adjustments are made to the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits or other items of the Subgroup or to the
Adjustments
SPCI Unitary Group not affecting the Subgroup (including adjustments for carryovers and carrybacks) for an Applicable Taxable Year, the amount due to or from the Company or Parent, as the case may be, under this Agreement for such taxable year shall be redetermined by taking into account such adjustments.  If, as a result of such redetermination, any amount due under this Agreement differs from the amount previously paid, then payment of such difference shall be made (i) in the case of an adjustment resulting in a credit or refund payable to the SPCI Unitary Group, within seven (7) business days after the date on which such credit or refund is allowed or received with respect to such adjustment, and (ii) in the case of an adjustment resulting in a deficiency of the SPCI Unitary Group, within seven (7) business days after the date on which the deficiency payment is made.  Any interest, penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts required to be paid to the State of Illinois, and any overpayment interest received from the State of Illinois, shall be allocated between Parent and the Company in the same manner and at the same time as provided in this subsection with respect to the underlying tax or refund of tax.  For the avoidance of doubt, any refund of taxes shown on the amended return reflecting the filing of a Unitary Return for the 1997 tax year, which was filed prior to the date hereof, and any overpayment interest with respect to such refund shall be paid by the Company to Parent within seven (7) business days after the Company's receipt of such refund and interest.  Anything in this subsection to the contrary notwithstanding, Section 1(b) hereof (rather than this subsection) shall apply to any taxable year with respect to which there has been a determination by a governmental authority (pursuant to an audit, litigation, or other proceeding) to the effect that the members of the Subgroup were not permitted to join in the filing of one or more Unitary Returns.
(e)          .  If the State of Illinois asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of taxes for which Parent or the Company is or may be liable under this Agreement, then the party hereto first receiving notice of such tax claim promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the other party; , that the failure of such party to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this Section 1, except to the extent the other party is actually prejudiced thereby.  Such notice shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the State of Illinois.  Parent and the Company shall have the right to jointly control any audit, examination, contest litigation or other proceeding (a "") against the State of Illinois in respect of any Unitary Return, other than a Parent Proceeding (as defined below).  Parent shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any Parent Proceeding; provided, that (i) Parent shall provide the Company with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such proceeding (including copies of any correspondence with the State of Illinois), (ii) Parent shall consult with the Company before taking any significant action in connection with such proceeding, (iii) Parent shall consult with the Company and offer the Company an opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials to the State of Illinois, (iv) Parent shall conduct such tax proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such proceeding, and (v) Parent shall not settle or compromise such proceeding without the Company's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such settlement or compromise would have a material adverse impact on the Company or its subsidiaries.

In the event that the Company or any member of the consolidated group of which the Company is the common parent (the "") suffers any loss as a result of the Restoration Election that would not have been incurred but for the Restoration Election, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Consolidated Group from and against any such losses.  In the case of a loss consisting of a deferral (rather than a permanent disallowance) of a loss or deduction for U.S. federal, state or local income tax purposes, the indemnification provided by the preceding sentence shall be equal to the difference between (i) the present value of the tax benefit of such loss or deduction with the Restoration Election and (ii) the present value of the tax benefit of such loss or deduction without the Restoration Election.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the present value of the tax benefit of a loss or deduction shall be calculated as follows: (A) the discount rate shall be equal to the "applicable federal rate" (as defined in Section 1274(d)(1) of the Code) applicable to a term equal to the period over which the indemnified party could have utilized the loss or deduction, (B) it shall be assumed that the indemnified party could have utilized the loss or deduction at the earliest time permitted by law, and (C) it shall be assumed that the indemnified party is subject to tax at the maximum applicable corporate income tax rate.
