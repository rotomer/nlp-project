Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
                                         
 
On April 7, 2005, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the pricing of a secondary offering and related transactions involving the Company's equity stake in Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen").  The press release, which describes certain terms of these transactions, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  In connection with these transactions, on April 6, 2005, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement, forward sale agreements and indemnity agreements.
 
Underwriting Agreement.
 
On April 6, 2005, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Nuveen and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch") and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley & Co."), as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, in connection with the sale by the Company of 39,309,155 shares of Class A common stock of Nuveen (the "the stock offering").  The closing of the sale of shares occurred on April 12, 2005.  The underwriting agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Forward Sale Agreements.
 
On April 6, 2005, the Company entered into a forward sale agreement with Merrill Lynch International (the "ML Counterparty"), an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, and Merrill Lynch, as agent and collateral agent.  Under this forward sale agreement, the Company has agreed to deliver, subject to the Company's right to cash settle such forward sale agreement, 5,824,800 shares of Nuveen Class A common stock to such affiliate.  Under such forward sale agreement, the ML Counterparty has paid the Company for the shares underlying such forward sale agreement an aggregate price of $184,290,200, which reflects an aggregate discount of $13,753,000 from the offering price to the public in the stock offering.  In connection with the forward sale agreement, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. issued debt securities mandatorily exchangeable for shares of Nuveen Class A common stock (or the cash value thereof) (the "ML Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities") and pursuant to the terms of a related Indemnity Agreement discussed below, the Company paid $8,251,800 to the underwriters of such Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities.
 
In addition, on April 6, 2005, the Company entered into a forward sale agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (the "MS Counterparty" and, together with the ML Counterparty, the "Counterparties"), an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co., and Morgan Stanley & Co., as agent and collateral agent.  Under this forward sale agreement, the Company has agreed to deliver, subject to the Company's right to cash settle such forward sale agreement, 6,067,500 shares of Nuveen Class A common stock to the MS Counterparty.  Under this forward sale agreement, the MS Counterparty has paid the Company for the shares underlying such forward sale agreement an aggregate price of $192,542,000, which reflects an aggregate discount of $13,753,000 from the offering price to the public in the stock offering.  In connection with the forward sale agreement, Morgan Stanley issued debt securities mandatorily exchangeable for shares of Nuveen Class A common stock (or the cash value thereof) (together with the ML Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities, the "Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities") and pursuant to the terms of a related Indemnity Agreement discussed below, the Company paid $8,251,800 to the underwriters of such Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities.
The settlement dates of the forward sale agreements with the Counterparties will be no later than March 31, 2006, provided that the settlement dates may be accelerated at the election of the Company.   Each forward sale agreement provides that the Company will make delivery or payment in property or cash, as the case may be, to the relevant Counterparty in respect of dividends on the number of Nuveen Class A common stock underlying such forward sale agreement prior to the final settlement date. In addition, as part of each forward sale agreement, the Company has pledged to the relevant Counterparty, to secure its obligations under such forward sale agreement, a number of shares of Nuveen Class B common stock equal to the number of shares of Nuveen Class A common stock underlying such forward sale agreement.  Until delivery of shares of Nuveen Class A common stock upon settlement under the forward sale agreements, the Company will continue to beneficially own and vote the shares of Nuveen Class B common stock pledged to secure such forward sale agreements.  If the Company elects to settle a forward sale agreement in cash, instead of delivering shares of Nuveen Class A common stock, it will continue to beneficially own and vote the shares of Nuveen common stock underlying each such agreement following the performance of such forward sale agreement.
 
The forward sale agreements are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Indemnity Agreements.
 
On April 6, 2005, the Company entered into an indemnity agreement with Nuveen, the MS Counterparty, Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley & Co. and Merrill Lynch.  In addition, on April 6, 2005, the Company entered into an indemnity agreement with Nuveen, the ML Counterparty, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley & Co.  These indemnity agreements were entered into by the parties in connection with the offerings by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and Morgan Stanley of their respective Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities and provide for indemnification by and among certain of the parties including the Company with respect to certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933.  These indemnity agreements also contain certain representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and Nuveen in relation to the offerings of the Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities and include the agreements referred to above by the Company to pay the underwriters of the Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities $8,251,800 in relation to each of the two offerings of Mandatorily Exchangeable Securities.
 
The indemnity agreements are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.4 and 10.5 and are incorporated herein by reference.

None of the Company or its subsidiaries, other than the Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, is required to be registered, licensed or qualified as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder or under the laws of requiring any such registration, licensing or qualification in any jurisdiction in which it conducts business, except where any failure to be so registered, licensed, or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, without independent verification, (x) as to matters of fact, to the extent he deems appropriate, on
certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials, and (y) as to matters involving the application of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois, the federal laws of the United States and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, to the extent he deems appropriate and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom he reasonably believes to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters.

opinion, counsel for the Selling Stockholders may assume that when such payment, delivery and crediting occur, (x) such Shares will have been registered in the name of Cede or another nominee designated by DTC, in each case on the Company's share registry in accordance with its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable law, (y) DTC will be registered as a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of Section 8-102 of the UCC and (z) appropriate entries to the accounts of the several Underwriters on the records of DTC will have been made pursuant to the UCC.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, without independent verification, (x) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem appropriate, upon the representations of each Selling Stockholder contained herein and in other documents and instruments, provided that you are provided copies of such other documents and instruments and they are reasonably satisfactory to your counsel, and (y) as to legal matters, to the extent they deem appropriate and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion or opinions of other counsel of good standing whom they reasonably believe to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters.

In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Selling Stockholders and all persons, if any, who control the Selling Stockholders within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates of any Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company.  In the

of any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholders and such control persons of the Selling Stockholders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Selling Stockholders.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
case
 
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 9(e)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 9(e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholders and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares.  The relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.  The liability of each Selling Stockholder under the contribution agreement contained in this paragraph shall be limited to an amount
(e)
                                 
to the net proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the Underwriters in respect of the Shares sold by such Selling Stockholder under this Agreement.
equal
 
The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(e).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 11 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter.

In any such case either you or the Selling Stockholders shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of any the Company or the Selling Stockholders to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company or the Selling Stockholders shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company or the Selling Stockholders, as the case may be, will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

Contribution
                                
Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, respectively, as set forth in Section 10(b) below, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, respectively, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
For purposes of determining the relative benefits of Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, respectively, the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) shall be deemed to have been received by Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers, and the relative benefits of Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand, shall be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) deemed received by Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters (including pursuant to this Agreement), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Securities Prospectus Supplement (replacing Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers for the Mandatory Issuer) and including any discounts received by affiliates of the Underwriters under the Selling Stockholder Forward Agreements, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities, and the Mandatory Issuer shall be deemed not to have received any benefits.
(b)
                                
 
The relative fault of Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer, the Underwriters and the Forward Counterparty, respectively, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer, the Underwriters or the Forward Counterparty and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(c)
                                 
 
The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Securities they have purchased under the ML Securities Underwriting Agreement, and not joint.
(d)
                                
 
The liability of St. Paul Travelers under the contribution agreement contained in this Section 10 shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price received or to be received by St. Paul Travelers under the ML Forward Agreement less any commissions paid or payable under this Agreement; that the liability of the Mandatory Issuer, the Underwriters and the Forward Counterparty, collectively, under the contribution agreement contained

provided
in this Section 10 shall not be increased as a result of this limitation on the liability of St. Paul Travelers.
 
Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 10.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, collectively, shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, collectively, have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(f)
                                   
pro rata
 
The remedies provided for in Section 9 and this Section 10 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(g)
                                
 
.  The indemnity provisions contained in Section 9, the contribution provisions contained in Section 10, and the representations, warranties and other statements of Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (a) any termination of this Agreement, (b) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter, the Mandatory Issuer, any person controlling the Mandatory Issuer or any affiliate of the Mandatory Issuer, the Forward Counterparty, any person controlling the Forward Counterparty or any affiliate of the Forward Counterparty, St. Paul Travelers or any person controlling St. Paul Travelers, or Nuveen, its officers or directors or any person controlling Nuveen and (c) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.

(b)           For purposes of determining the relative benefits of Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, respectively, the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) shall be deemed to have been received by Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers, and the relative benefits of Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand, shall be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) deemed received by Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters (including pursuant to this Agreement), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Securities Prospectus Supplement (replacing Nuveen and St. Paul Travelers for the Mandatory Issuer) and including any discounts received by affiliates of the Underwriters under the Selling Stockholder Forward Agreements, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities, and the Mandatory Issuer shall be deemed not to have received any benefits.
 
(c)           The relative fault of Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer, the Underwriters and the Forward Counterparty, respectively, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by Nuveen, St. Paul Travelers, the Mandatory Issuer, the Underwriters or the Forward Counterparty and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(d)           The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Securities they have purchased under the MS Securities Underwriting Agreement, and not joint.

this Section 10 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 10.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, collectively, shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Mandatory Issuer and the Underwriters, collectively, have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
SAINT PAUL, Minn.April 7, 2005The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:STA) announced today that it has agreed to sell 39.3 million shares of Nuveen Investments common stock in a previously announced secondary offering at $34.00 per share ($32.98 per share net of underwriting discount). The transaction is expected to close on April 12, 2005. In connection with the secondary offering, the underwriters have been granted a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase an additional 3.9 million shares. Assuming the exercise in full of the over-allotment option, St. Paul Travelers will receive proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion from the secondary offering.
 
Concurrently with the closing of the secondary offering, Nuveen Investments will repurchase directly from St. Paul Travelers approximately 6.1 million shares of Nuveen Investments common stock at a price per share of $32.98 for total consideration of $200 million. In addition, upon the receipt of certain Nuveen fund approvals, but in any event no later than December 23, 2005, Nuveen Investments will purchase approximately 12.1 million additional shares of Nuveen Investments common stock from St. Paul Travelers at a price per share of $32.98 for total consideration of $400 million plus interest. St. Paul Travelers will receive the cash proceeds from this transaction at the time of such purchase.
 
St. Paul Travelers has also entered into forward sale agreements settling no later than March 31, 2006 with affiliates of Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. These agreements are for an aggregate of approximately 11.9 million shares of Nuveen Investments common stock. St. Paul Travelers will receive cash proceeds of approximately $360 million from these forward sale agreements on April 12, 2005.
 
Upon the closing of the secondary offering, assuming the exercise in full of the over-allotment option and the $200 million stock repurchase by Nuveen Investments, St. Paul Travelers' ownership interest in Nuveen will decline from 78% to 27%. Upon final settlement in subsequent quarters of the forward sale transactions, assuming they are all settled in Nuveen shares, St. Paul Travelers will have sold all of its ownership interest in Nuveen Investments.
