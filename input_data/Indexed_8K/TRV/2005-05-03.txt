NEWS RELEASE
 
 St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul Travelers," NYSE: STA) today reported income from continuing operations of $877 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, or $1.31 per basic share and $1.25 per diluted share, compared to $587 million, or $1.35 per basic share and $1.31 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio was 90.5 percent, 1.4 points lower than in the prior year quarter.  Net income for the current quarter was $212 million, or $0.31 per basic share and diluted share, compared to $587 million, or $1.35 per basic share and $1.31 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Net income for the current quarter included a $665 million after-tax loss from discontinued operations, which consisted of the $687 million tax charge previously disclosed in the company's March 30 press release, related to the company's disposition of its equity stake in Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen"), partially offset by the company's share of Nuveen's net income for the quarter.
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (May 3, 2005)
 
Operating income for the current quarter was $859 million, or $1.28 per basic share and $1.23 per diluted share, compared to $614 million, or $1.41 per basic share and $1.37 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  Operating income represents reported net income excluding the impact of realized investment gains and losses and the results of discontinued operations.
 
St. Paul Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul") and Travelers Property Casualty Corp. ("Travelers") merged to form St. Paul Travelers on April 1, 2004.  St. Paul Travelers' results for the first quarter of 2004 do not include the results of St. Paul.

 - 
                 
 
GAAP combined ratio of 90.5 percent, 1.4 points lower than in the prior year quarter.

 - 
                 
 
Gross written premiums of $5.921 billion, up 47 percent from the prior year quarter and down 3 percent on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the runoff businesses categorized as Commercial Other.
 - 
                 
 
On April 6, the secondary offering and related transactions for the sale of the company's equity investment in Nuveen were priced.  The company has received approximately $1.8 billion of cash to date and expects to receive an additional $400 million upon closing of the forward share repurchase contract with Nuveen, expected to occur in the third quarter of this year.  Total after-tax cash proceeds, excluding 3.9 million shares associated with the underwriters' overallotment option, are estimated to be $2.0 billion, after utilization of the company's remaining net operating loss carryforward of approximately $1.6 billion.
 
Jay Fishman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are off to an excellent start, with all our business segments generating very strong operating income in the quarter.  With our fundamental earnings power emerging, we believe that we are well positioned to generate attractive returns for our investors while having adequate resources to make the investments necessary to provide for future profitable growth.
 
 "Retention levels are very strong and operating margins are very attractive, as loss indications remain at low levels and renewal price changes for our company stay modestly positive.  While we actively seek opportunities for new business, we will not compromise our underwriting discipline and will add volume only when pricing meets our return hurdles.
 
"We are excited about the franchise that we have created and all of the competitive advantages and opportunities that it provides us in the marketplace," concluded Mr. Fishman.
 
Gross written premiums increased 47 percent from the prior year quarter to $5.921 billion.  The increase was due to the inclusion of St. Paul's gross written premiums in the current quarter.  Gross written premiums, excluding the premium impact of the runoff businesses categorized as Commercial Other, decreased 3 percent on a pro forma combined basis from the prior year quarter.  This decrease is primarily due to relatively modest declines in renewal price changes in the company's Commercial segment, decreases in the Specialty segment's construction business due to the nearly completed process of aligning the construction underwriting profile of the two predecessor companies and lower new business volume in both the Commercial and Specialty segments.  The company's Personal segment continues to experience positive growth.
 
Net written premiums as reported increased 41 percent from the prior year quarter to $4.780 billion.  Net written premiums, excluding the premium impact of the runoff businesses categorized as Commercial Other, decreased 6 percent on a pro forma combined basis from the prior year quarter.  This decrease was impacted by changes in the terms and timing of the purchase of the company's reinsurance programs for its Specialty segment which resulted in more premiums being ceded in the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.  These changes significantly impact the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net written premiums.
 
Net investment income for the current quarter was $583 million after-tax ($765 million pre-tax), which was driven by continued strong operating cash flows.
The current quarter GAAP combined ratio of 90.5 percent included 2.2 points for net favorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve development and 1.7 points for catastrophe losses (1.1 points related to the prior year and 0.6 points related to the current year).
 
For the first quarter of 2005, the Commercial segment reported operating income of $433 million.  Loss indications remain at low levels resulting in favorable operating margins.  The current quarter Commercial GAAP combined ratio was 94.9 percent.
 
Gross and net written premiums for the Commercial segment decreased 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, on a pro forma combined basis from the prior year quarter, excluding the premium impact of the runoff businesses categorized as Commercial Other, and decreased 12 percent and 13 percent, respectively, overall.  The decrease quarter over quarter is primarily due to lower new business volume and relatively modest declines in renewal price changes.  In addition, the previous year quarter benefited from increased new business associated with the Royal & SunAlliance and Atlantic Mutual renewal rights transactions.  Retention rates were very strong in the current quarter, and new business levels were higher than in the third and fourth quarters of 2004.
 
premiums for these businesses.  Approximately $51 million of gross written premiums previously written by Gulf were renewed by Domestic Specialty in the current quarter.
Gross written premiums for Commercial Other, which is comprised of the results of Gulf and other run-off operations, decreased to $78 million on a pro forma combined basis from the prior year quarter (or to $40 million on a net written premium basis) due to the intentional non-renewal of written
 
Specialty Segment Financial Results
 
For the first quarter 2005, the Specialty segment reported operating income of $188 million.  The results included an after-tax charge of $47 million ($71 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses, of which $34 million ($52 million pre-tax) was adverse prior year loss development related to the third quarter 2004 hurricanes, and $13 million ($19 million pre-tax) was current quarter catastrophe losses related to floods in the U.K.  The Specialty GAAP combined ratio was 95.6 percent in the current quarter, which included 4.8 points for catastrophe losses (3.5 points related to the prior year and 1.3 points related to the current year).
 
Gross written premiums decreased 2 percent on a pro forma combined basis from the prior year quarter due to the nearly completed process of aligning the construction underwriting profile of the two predecessor companies, partially offset by higher premium volume in several Domestic and International Specialty businesses.  Approximately $51 million of gross written premiums previously written in Gulf were renewed in Domestic Specialty in the current quarter.
 
Net written premiums decreased 12 percent on a pro forma combined basis from the prior year quarter to $1.216 billion due to changes in the terms and timing of the purchase of the company's reinsurance programs, as discussed above.  These changes significantly impact the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net written premiums in the Specialty segment.  The decrease in net written premiums also incorporates a modest adjustment to 2004 ceded written premiums in the Specialty segment to report at inception all ceded written premiums for reinsurance agreements that have minimum amounts required to be ceded.  Previously, ceded written premiums for certain of these agreements were reported over the life of the reinsurance contracts.  This change only affected the statistical disclosure of net written premiums and had no effect on gross written premiums or GAAP or statutory quarterly earned premiums, operating results or capital.  There were no significant changes in company-wide quarterly trends in 2004.  However, within Specialty, the quarter with the largest impact was the third quarter of 2004, in which adjusted net written premiums on a pro forma combined basis increased 4 percent quarter-over-quarter rather than the 7 percent decrease previously reported.
Within Domestic Specialty, retention was slightly higher than the prior year quarter, although modestly down from the fourth quarter 2004, and new business levels were consistent with the fourth quarter 2004.  Within International Specialty, excluding Lloyd's, retention levels were substantially higher than in the prior year quarter and consistent with the fourth quarter 2004, and new business levels were modestly lower than in prior quarters.
 
Personal Segment Financial Results
 
For the first quarter 2005, the Personal segment reported operating income of $285 million compared to $237 million in the prior year quarter.  The 20 percent increase in 2005 was primarily due to continued favorable claim frequency in both the Auto and the Homeowners and Other lines, severity trend improvement in the Auto line and growth in business volumes, particularly in the Homeowners and Other line.  The current quarter results included an after-tax benefit of $78 million ($120 million pre-tax) from favorable prior year reserve development related to continued declines in claim frequency and severity in both the Auto and the Homeowners and Other lines, a $4 million after-tax charge ($6 million pre-tax) for adverse prior year loss development related to the third quarter 2004 hurricanes and a $7 million after-tax charge ($12 million pre-tax) for current quarter catastrophe losses related to hailstorms in Texas.  This compares to an after-tax benefit of $66 million ($101 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development and an after-tax charge of $13 million ($20 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.
 
The Personal GAAP combined ratio was 78.7 percent in the current quarter, compared to 84.3 percent in the prior year quarter.  The significant improvement in the combined ratio was primarily due to the recognition of lower frequency in both the Auto and the Homeowners and Other lines, consistent with trends in the past few quarters.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio included 7.8 points of net favorable prior year development (including 0.4 points for adverse prior year loss development related to the third quarter 2004 hurricanes) and 0.8 points of current quarter catastrophe losses.  The prior year quarter GAAP combined ratio included 7.8 points of net favorable prior year development and 1.5 points of catastrophe losses.
 
First quarter gross written premiums increased 4 percent from the prior year quarter and net written premiums increased 5 percent, primarily due to unit growth in Homeowners and Other, as well as continued increases in premium rates across both the Automobile and the Homeowners and Other lines of business.
 
Automobile net written premiums increased 1 percent and policies in force grew 5 percent in the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.  Improving industry results over the past few years has increased competition, particularly for personal auto.  While retention remains strong, new business volume has slowed.
Homeowners and Other net written premiums and policies in force both increased 12 percent from the prior year quarter due to a combination of price increases and higher new business.  Business growth is strongest in less catastrophe exposed areas.  While competition has led to a slowing of new business volume, retention rates remain strong and consistent with prior quarters.

Glossary of Financial Measures
 
The following measures are used by the company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the company's financial performance.
 
is net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations on a per share basis. is operating income on a per share basis.
Operating income

is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on investment securities and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Return on equity
Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the company's management, operating income, operating income per share, and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.  This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses).
Underwriting gain or loss
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be

related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premium. A GAAP combined ratio under 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
 
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
 
reflect the addition of gross and net written premiums, respectively, of The St. Paul and Travelers for periods prior to the merger on April 1, 2004.  The pro forma combined gross and net written premium amounts are not affected by purchase accounting adjustments.  Gross and net written premiums are a measure of business volume before and after reinsurance.  The pro forma information presented is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition and related transactions been made at the beginning of the applicable period, or of future results of the company.
Pro forma combined gross and net written premiums
 
represents assets less liabilities excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property-casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the second quarter 2004:
 
offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services and is organized into the following three marketing and underwriting groups focusing on a particular client base or product grouping to provide products and services that specifically address clients' needs: Commercial Accounts, Select Accounts and National Accounts. includes policies written by Gulf, primarily management and professional liability coverages (prior to the integration of these products into Specialty in April 2004), the Special Liability Group and runoff operations.
Commercial:
Commercial  Core
Commercial - Other
 
provides dedicated underwriting, claim and risk control services that require specialized expertise, domestically and internationally.  Domestic Specialty includes Financial and Professional Services, Bond, Construction, Technology, Ocean Marine, Oil and Gas, Public Sector and Excess & Umbrella, among others.  International Specialty includes operations in the U.K, Ireland, Canada and the company's participation in Lloyd's.
Specialty
 
writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks.  The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
Personal
comprises Nuveen Investments, whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments.  The Company held a 78% interest in Nuveen Investments as of March 31, 2005.
Discontinued Operations (Asset Management)
 
* * * * *
Segment results for the first quarter 2004 have been restated from the historical presentation of Travelers to conform to the new St. Paul Travelers segment arrangement where practicable and only include the results of Travelers.  As a result, for the first quarter 2004 Bond and Construction results were disaggregated from historical Travelers Commercial Lines segment to create a historical Specialty segment and to restate Commercial into the new format.
 
Invested and other assets and net investment income (NII) of historical Travelers had been specifically identified by reporting segment prior to the merger.  Beginning in the second quarter 2004, the company developed a methodology to allocate NII and invested assets to the identified segments.  This methodology allocates pre-tax NII based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment.  It is not practicable to apply the methodology to historical businesses and as such, actual (versus allocated) NII is included in revenues and operating income of the restated segments for periods prior to the merger.  It is also not practicable to present total assets for restated Specialty and Commercial segments for periods prior to the merger.  The company believes that the differences, if any, are not significant to a comparison with the new segment presentation.
 
Forward Looking Statement
 
This press release may contain, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Reinsurance Recoverables
($ in millions)
 
 
The Company's top five reinsurers, including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2004 is as follows:
 
 
The gross reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.

Financial Supplement - First Quarter 2005
 
All historical information through the first quarter of 2004 included in this Financial Supplement presents only results of Travelers as Travelers is being treated as the accounting acquirer.  Where applicable, historical results conform with current business segment definitions.
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
Operating income
is net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations.  is operating income on a per share basis.
Operating income per share
 
Return on equity
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
Underwriting gain or loss
is the net earned premiums and the fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.  This profit or loss calculation includes reinsurance assumed and ceded but excludes net investment income and net realized investment gains (losses).
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
Loss reserve development
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 
GAAP combined ratio
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premium. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
 
Gross written premiums
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
 
Pro forma combined gross and net written premiums
reflect the addition of gross and net written premiums, respectively, of The St. Paul and Travelers for periods prior to the merger on April 1, 2004. The pro forma combined gross and net written premium amounts are not affected by purchase accounting adjustments. Gross and net written premiums are a measure of business volume before and after reinsurance.  The pro forma information presented is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition and related transactions been made at the beginning of the applicable period, or of future results of the company.
 
Adjusted book value per share
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property-casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the second quarter 2004:
 
Commercial:
Commercial  Core
offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services and is organized into the following three marketing and underwriting groups focusing on a particular client base or product grouping to provide products and services that specifically address clients' needs: Commercial Accounts, Select Accounts and National Accounts.  includes policies written by Gulf, primarily management and professional liability coverages (prior to the integration of these products into Specialty in April 2004), the Special Liability Group and runoff operations.
Commercial - Other
 
Specialty
provides dedicated underwriting, claim and risk control services that require specialized expertise, domestically and internationally. Domestic Specialty includes Financial and Professional Services, Bond, Construction, Technology, Ocean Marine, Oil and Gas, Public Sector, and Excess and Umbrella, among others.  International Specialty includes operations in the U.K., Ireland, Canada, and the company's participation in Lloyds.
 
Personal
writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks.  The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
 
Discontinued Operations (Asset Management)
comprisesNuveen Investments, whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments.  The Company held a 78% interest in Nuveen Investments as of March 31, 2005.
* * * * *
Segment results for periods begining prior to April 1, 2004 have been restated from the historical presentation of  Travelers to conform to the new St. Paul Travelers segment arrangement where practicable.  As a result, prior quarter Bond and Construction results were disaggregated from historical Travelers Commercial Lines segment to create a historical Specialty segment and to restate Commercial into the new format.
 
Invested and other assets and net investment income (NII) of historical Travelers had been specifically identified by reporting segment prior to the merger.  Beginning in the second quarter 2004, the Company developed a methodology to allocate NII and invested assets to the identified  segments.  This methodology allocates pretax NII based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment.  It is not practicable to apply the methodology to historical businesses and as such, actual (versus allocated) NII is included in revenues and operating income of the restated segments for periods prior to the merger.  It is also not practicable to present total assets for restated Specialty and Commercial segments for periods prior to the merger.  The Company believes that the differences, if any, are not significant to a comparison with the new segment presentation.
