Indemnification
 
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon the failure to have an effective Registration Statement relating to the Notes or the failure to satisfy the prospectus delivery requirements of the Act because the Company failed to provide the Remarketing Agents or Reset Agents with a Prospectus for delivery or an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or the Remarketing of the Notes or the establishment of the Reset Rate, as the case may be, or the engagement of the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents pursuant to, or the performance of the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents of their respective services (including any such services performed on or prior to the date hereof) contemplated by, this Agreement, and will reimburse each Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, expressly for use therein. The Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents shall incur no liability to and shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company for, or in respect of, any actions taken, omitted to be taken or suffered to be taken in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Remarketing Agents or Reset Agents, as the case may be, in reasonable reliance upon the advice of counsel satisfactory to it or instructions from the Trustee (pursuant to the Indenture) or the Company.
(a)
         
 
Each Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
(b)
        
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party (or such other release of the indemnified party as shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not
(c)
         
include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which are, or are to be, remarketed bears to the aggregate fees received by the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents with respect to the Remarketing. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent or Reset
(d)
        
Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which its aggregate fee in connection with the Remarketing exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Remarketing Agents' and Reset Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several and not joint.
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of each Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent and each person, if any, who controls a Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Company, the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents; and the obligations of the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agents and or Reset Agents, as the case may be, may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act.
(e)
                 
 
. If this Agreement shall be terminated by a Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent pursuant to Section 9(a), the Company shall then be under no liability to such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent except as provided in Sections 1, 4, 6 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Notes are not remarketed by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents in making preparations for the Remarketing of the Notes not so remarketed, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents in respect of the Notes not so remarketed except as provided in Sections 1, 4, 6 and 9 hereof.
7.
                        
Further Liability
 
. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the remarketed Notes. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of remarketed Notes may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also
8.
                        
Dealing in the Notes
engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.
 
. (a) The Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents may resign and be discharged from their duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent; that no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, and such successor Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents. In any such case, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable.
9.
                        
Resignation and Removal
provided
 
The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
(b)
        
 
. This Agreement shall terminate as to any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, which is replaced on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent pursuant to Section 9. In addition, the obligations of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent may be terminated by it by notice given to the Company prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Initial Remarketing Date (or the Secondary Remarketing Date in the case of a Failed Initial Remarketing or the Final Remarketing Date in the case of a Failed Secondary Remarketing) if, prior to that time, any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur or upon the occurrence of any of the events in Section 5(h), (i) or (j), which termination shall be without liability on the part of any party to any other party, except that Sections 1, 4, 6, 7 and 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.
10.
                  
Termination of Remarketing Agreement
 
. Notwithstanding any termination pursuant to Section 9 or 10 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, each former Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Sections 1 and 6 of this Agreement notwithstanding the replacement of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Remarketing Agents or Reset Agents, as set forth
11.
                  
Survival
in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, or any controlling person of any Remarketing Agent, Reset Agent or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive the Remarketing.

12.
                  
Remarketing Agents' and Reset Agents' Performance; Duty of Care
 
The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents shall be read into this Agreement. In the absence of bad faith on the part of a Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it which purports to conform to the requirements of, or any information supplied to it by the Company pursuant to, the Transaction Documents or the Notes as to the truth of the statements expressed in any such documents. Each of the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to be signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. In no event shall the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents be liable to any person for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Remarketing Agents or Reset Agents, as the case may be, have been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(a)
         
 
Neither the Remarketing Agents nor the Reset Agents shall have any obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Notes, and they shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date or the Secondary Remarketing Date or the Final Remarketing Date, as the case may be) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. The Reset Agents shall not be liable for any error resulting from the use of or reliance on a source of information in good faith to make any determination, calculation or declaration hereunder. In acting under this Agreement and in connection with the Notes, the Remarketing Agents and the Reset Agents are acting solely as agents of the Company, do not assume any obligations to, or relationship of agency or trust for or with, any of the owners or holders of the Notes and none of the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents, acting under this Agreement, shall incur any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Company or its respective security holders or creditors or to any beneficial
(b)
        
owner or holder of remarketed Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be, relating to or arising out of the engagement of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent pursuant to, or the performance by such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent of their respective services contemplated by, this Agreement or for any action or failure to act in connection with the Remarketing or otherwise, except to the extent such liability is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Remarketing Agent or Reset Agent, as the case may be. The Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents may, upon obtaining the prior written consent of the Company, perform any duties hereunder through agents or attorneys, and the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care and in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by it hereunder. Each of the Remarketing Agents and Reset Agents may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase remarketed Notes for its own account. Any determination made by the Remarketing Agents or the Reset Agents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes and in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct shall be conclusive and binding upon the Remarketing Agents, the Reset Agents, the Company, the Trustee and the owners of the Notes, absent manifest error. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall also continue to apply to every Remarketing Agent and Reset Agent notwithstanding their resignation or removal.
