Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On June 10, 2005, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of financial institutions, including Citicorp USA, Inc., as administrative agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as joint lead arrangers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and Bank of America, N.A., The Bank of New York and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as documentation agents. The Credit Agreement replaced and consolidated the Company's existing $480 Million 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2004, and existing $270 Million Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2004, and Travelers Property Casualty Corp.'s existing $250 Million 45-Month Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of April 17, 2003. The Credit Agreement provides for up to $1.0 billion of unsecured credit. The interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Agreement are generally based on the administrative agent's base rate plus a specified margin or the Eurodollar rate plus a specified margin. The Company will pay a facility fee and, for any date on which advances exceed 50% of commitments, a utilization fee. The applicable margin and the rates on which these fees are based vary based upon the Company's long-term senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced debt ratings and the utilization of the facility. Pursuant to covenants in the Credit Agreement, the Company must maintain an excess of consolidated net worth over goodwill and other intangible assets of not less than $10 billion at all times. The Company must also maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default, including with respect to a change in control. The Credit Agreement will expire on the earlier of (a) June 10, 2010, subject to extension according to the terms of the Credit Agreement, and (b) the date of termination in whole of the commitments upon an optional termination or reduction of the commitments by the Company or upon an event of default. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company has an option to increase the credit available under the facility, no more than once a year, up to a maximum facility amount of $1.5 billion, subject to the satisfaction of a ratings requirement and certain other conditions.
