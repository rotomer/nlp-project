Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
This presentation may contain, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, the Company may make forward-looking statements about the Company's results of operations (including, among others, premium volume, income from continuing operations, net and operating income and return on equity), financial condition and liquidity; the sufficiency of the Company's asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the availability of reinsurance coverage; and strategic initiatives.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
 
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: adverse developments involving asbestos claims and related litigation; the impact of aggregate policy coverage limits for asbestos claims; the impact of bankruptcies of various asbestos producers and related businesses; the willingness of parties including the Company to settle asbestos-related litigation; the Company's ability to execute announced and future strategic initiatives as planned; insufficiency of, or changes in, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves; the Company's inability to obtain prices sought due to competition or otherwise; the occurrence of catastrophic events, both natural and man-made, including terrorist acts, with a severity or frequency exceeding the Company's expectations; adverse developments involving catastrophe claims, in particular those arising out of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, and any Company loss estimates with respect to these storms; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, environmental claims and related litigation; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, construction defect claims; the impact of claims related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, including, but not limited to, lead paint, silica and other potentially harmful substances; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures in medical costs and auto and building repair costs; the effects of corporate bankruptcies on surety bond claims; adverse developments relating to the cost and/or availability of reinsurance, the credit quality and liquidity of reinsurers and the Company's ability to collect reinsurance on a timely basis or at all; the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company; adverse developments in legal proceedings; judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability; the impact of legislative and other governmental actions, including, but not limited to, federal and state legislation related to asbestos liability reform, terrorism insurance and reinsurance (such as the extension of or replacement for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005) and governmental actions regarding the compensation of brokers and agents; the impact of well-publicized governmental investigations of certain industry practices, including with respect to business practices between insurers, including the Company, and brokers and the purchase and sale by insurers, including the Company, of finite, or non-traditional, insurance products; the performance of the Company's investment portfolios, which could be adversely impacted by adverse developments in U.S. and global financial markets, interest rates and rates of inflation; weakening U.S. and global economic conditions; larger than expected assessments for guaranty funds and mandatory pooling arrangements; a downgrade in the Company's claims-paying and financial strength ratings; the loss or significant restriction on the Company's ability to use credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal policies; and changes to the regulatory capital requirements.
 
The Company's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation or as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.
 
In this presentation, we may refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, including, among others, operating income, operating income excluding catastrophes, operating return on equity, underwriting gain (loss), GAAP combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year development and adjusted and tangible book value per common share.  For a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and a glossary of financial measures, we refer you to the financial supplement and other materials available on the St. Paul Travelers website (http://investor.stpaultravelers.com/).

STA utilizes reinsurance to transfer risk / reward of certain exposures, which aids in the company's ability to:
 -
