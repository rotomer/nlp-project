In accordance with the Company's plan to divest its equity ownership in Nuveen Investments, the Company classified Nuveen Investments as a discontinued operation beginning in 1Q 2005.  Additionally, due to the taxable nature of the transaction, the Company recorded a charge of $687 million in discontinued operations in 1Q 2005, reflecting the difference between the tax basis and the GAAP carrying value of its investment in Nuveen Investments. A $138 million after-tax gain was recorded in 2Q 2005 related to the divestiture of 45.9 million shares of Nuveen Investments.  An $85 million after-tax gain was recorded in 3Q 2005 related to the divesture of the remaining 27.5 million shares of Nuveen Investments.

The Company entered into these arrangements as part of its strategy to shorten the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio.  In a changing interest rate environment the change in the value of the futures contracts can be expected to partially offset changes in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio.

The Company's top five reinsurer groups,  including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience and current economic conditions.  Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at December 31, 2005, after deducting mandatory pool and structured settlement balances, $10.4 billion, or 78%, were rated by A.M. Best Company.  Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 95% were rated A- or better.  The remaining 22% net recoverables from reinsurers was comprised of the following:  5% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 7% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 10% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company.  In addition, $2.4 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at December 31, 2005.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.

Financial Supplement - Second Quarter 2006
Glossary of Financial Measures and Description of Operating Segments
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations.  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
 
is the ratio of net income to average equity  is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Return on equity
.
Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
represent additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties.
Reinstatement premiums
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
 
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
 
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
 
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
