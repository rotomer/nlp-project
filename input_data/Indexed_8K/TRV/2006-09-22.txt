The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc.
Financial Supplement - Second Quarter 2006
Business Realignment
In August 2006, the Company announced a realignment of two of its three business segments. The former Commercial and Specialty segments were realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. The Personal segment was renamed Personal Insurance. The changes were designed to reflect the manner in which the Company's businesses are currently managed, and represent an aggregation of products and services based on type of customer, how the business is marketed, and the manner in which the business is underwritten.  The following discussion  relates to the two realigned segments. Financial data for all periods presented was reclassified to be consistent with the new segment structure.
Business Insurance
The Business Insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients primarily in the United States. Business Insurance is organized into the following groups, which collectively comprise Business Insurance's core operations:
      serves small businesses and offers commercial multi-peril, property, general liability, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.
Select Accounts
      serves primarily mid-sized businesses for property and casualty products, including property, general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.  Certain units included in Commercial Accounts prior to the realignment are now included in the Industry - Focused Underwriting, Target Risk Underwriting or Specialized Distribution groups.
Commercial Accounts
      comprises three business units.  The largest provides casualty products and services to large companies, with particular emphasis on workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liability.  National Accounts also includes Discover Re, which provides unbundled property and casualty insurance products to insureds who utilize programs such as self-insurance, collateralized deductibles and captive reinsurers.  In addition, National Accounts includes the commercial residual market business, which primarily offers workers' compensation products and services to the involuntary market.
National Accounts
      . The following units serve targeted industries with unique combinations of insurance coverage, risk management, claims handling and other services:
Industry-Focused Underwriting
      serves a broad range of construction businesses, offering guaranteed cost products for small to mid-sized policyholders and loss sensitive programs for larger accounts. For the larger accounts the customer and the Company work together in actively managing and controlling exposure and claims and they share risk through policy features such as deductibles or retrospective rating. Products offered include workers' compensation, general liability and commercial auto coverages, and other risk management solutions.
Construction
      serves small to mid-sized companies involved in telecommunications, information technology, medical technology and electronics manufacturing, offering a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of products and services.  These products include property, commercial auto, general liability, workers' compensation, umbrella, internet liability, technology errors and omissions coverages and global companion products.
Technology
      markets insurance products and services to public entities including municipalities, counties, Indian Nation gaming and selected special government districts such as water and sewer utilities. The policies written by this unit typically cover property, commercial auto, general liability and errors and omissions exposures.
Public Sector Services
      provides specialized property and liability products and services for customers involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including operators and drilling contractors, as well as various service and supply companies and manufacturers that support upstream operations. The policies written by this business group insure drilling rigs, natural gas facilities, and production and gathering platforms, and cover risks including physical damage, liability and business interruption.
Oil & Gas
      serves small to medium-sized agricultural businesses, including farms, ranches, wineries and related operations, offering property and liability coverages other than workers' compensation.
Agribusiness
      . The following units serve commercial businesses requiring specialized product underwriting, claims handling and risk management services:

      provides insurance for goods in transit and movable objects for customers such as jewelers, museums, contractors and the transportation industry.  Builders' Risk insurance is also offered to customers during the construction, renovation or repair of buildings and other structures.
Inland Marine
      serves the marine transportation industry and related services, as well as other businesses involved in international trade. The Company's product offerings fall under six main coverage categories: marine liability, cargo, hull and machinery, protection and indemnity, pleasure craft, and marine property and liability.
Ocean Marine
      serves small to mid-sized commercial businesses, offering mono-line umbrella and excess coverage where the Company does not write the primary casualty coverage, or where other business units within the Company prefer to outsource the underwriting of umbrella and excess business based on the expertise and/or limit capacity of Excess Casualty. 
Excess Casualty
      serves customers ranging from small commercial firms to Fortune 100 companies, offering comprehensive breakdown coverages for equipment, including property and business interruption coverages.   Through the BoilerRe unit, Boiler and Machinery also serves other property casualty carriers that do not have in-house expertise with reinsurance, underwriting, engineering, claim handling and risk management services for this type of coverage.
Boiler & Machinery
      provides insurance to U.S. companies with foreign property and liability exposures ("home-foreign"), and foreign organizations with property and liability exposures located in the United States ("reverse-flow"), as part of a global program.

The Company's Personal Catastrophe Risk business had been included in the Specialty segment prior to the August 2006 segment realignment.  In accordance with the terms of the sale agreement, the Company retained responsibility for the pre-sale claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to the Personal Catastrophe Risk business and remains responsible for any changes in estimates in those reserves through a quota-share reinsurance agreement.  All of these operations are collectively referred to as Business Insurance Other.

The Company's operations primarily underwrite employers' liability (similar to workers' compensation coverage in the United States), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), motor (similar to automobile coverage in the United States) and property.  At , the Company underwrites four principal lines of businessaviation, marine, global property, and accident and special risksthrough Syndicate 5000, for which the Company provides 100% of the capital. During the second half of 2004, the Company made a decision to exit certain portions of the Lloyd's personal lines business. In early 2005, the Company sold the right to renew this business as well as the operating companies that supported it.

Reinsurance Recoverables
($ in millions)
 
 
The Company's top five reinsurer groups,  including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience and current economic conditions.  Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at December 31, 2005, after deducting mandatory pool and structured settlement balances, $10.4 billion, or 78%, were rated by A.M. Best Company.  Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 95% were rated A- or better.  The remaining 22% net recoverables from reinsurers was comprised of the following:  5% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 7% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 10% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company.  In addition, $2.4 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at December 31, 2005.
 
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.

Financial Supplement - Second Quarter 2006
Glossary of Financial Measures and Description of Operating Segments
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations.  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
is the ratio of net income to average equity  is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Return on equity
.
Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
represent additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties.
Reinstatement premiums
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the third quarter 2006:
The Business Insurance segment, offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services in the United States, and includes: Select Accounts; Commercial Accounts; National Accounts; Industry-Focused Underwriting including Construction, Technology, Public Sector Services, Oil & Gas, and Agribusiness; Target Risk Underwriting including National Property, Inland Marine, Ocean Marine, Excess Casualty, Boiler & Machinery and Global Accounts; and Specialized Distribution including Northland, National Programs and Underwriting Facilities.  Business Insurance also includes policies written by Gulf (primarily management and professional liability coverages), Personal Catastrophe Risk business, and other runoff operations, as well as the Special Liability Group.
Business Insurance -
- The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment includes surety, crime, and financial liability businesses which primarily use credit-based underwriting processes, as well as property and casualty products that are predominantly marketed on an international basis.  The business units in Financial, Professional & International Insurance are Bond, Financial & Professional Services, International and Lloyd's.
Financial, Professional & International Insurance
writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks.  The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
Personal Insurance
comprisesNuveen Investments, whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments.  During the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed the divestiture of its ownership interest of Nuveen Investments.
Discontinued Operations (Asset Management)
  The Company's historical Commercial and Specialty segments have been realigned into two new segments:  the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment.  As a result, prior quarter results of certain businesses have been disaggregated from the historical Specialty segment and are now reported in the Business Insurance segment.  In addition, the Personal segment has been renamed Personal Insurance.
Prior quarter segment results have been restated from the historical presentation to conform with current business segment definitions where applicable.
