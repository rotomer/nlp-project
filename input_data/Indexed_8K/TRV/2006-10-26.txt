NEWS RELEASE
 The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul Travelers," NYSE:STA) today reported net income of $1.043 billion, or $1.52 per basic share and $1.47 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, compared to $162 million, or $0.24 per basic share and $0.23 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.  Net income in the prior year quarter included an $87 million after-tax gain from discontinued operations, primarily related to the disposition of St. Paul Travelers' equity stake in Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen"). Operating income in the current quarter was $1.037 billion, or $1.51 per basic share and $1.46 per diluted share, compared to $50 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (October 26, 2006)
Net and operating income in the current quarter included an after-tax benefit of $55 million ($87 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development.  This amount included after-tax charges of $102 million ($155 million pre-tax) and $79 million ($120 million pre-tax) for asbestos and environmental reserve development, respectively, which were more than offset by an after-tax benefit of $236 million ($362 million pre-tax) for other net favorable prior year reserve development, including $66 million after-tax ($113 million pre-tax) due to an approximately 5 percent reduction in reported pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.  Net and operating income in the current quarter also included an after-tax benefit of $43 million ($67 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2006.  In the prior year quarter, net and operating income included after-tax benefits of $70 million ($102 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development and $45 million ($70 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2005.
Catastrophe losses in the current quarter of $10 million after-tax ($15 million pre-tax) were significantly lower than the prior year quarter due to a very benign wind season.  The prior year quarter included catastrophe losses of $1.009 billion after-tax ($1.524 billion pre-tax), net of reinsurance and including reinstatement premiums, related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Current Quarter Highlights
Return on equity of 17.6 percent and operating return on equity of 17.4 percent.
                 
Net written premiums of $5.284 billion, a 4 percent increase from the prior year quarter. Excluding the Company's runoff operations and adjusting for the estimated impact of transitioning to six-month policies for personal automobile new business, net written premiums increased approximately 6 percent.
                 
Net investment income of $668 million after-tax, a 7 percent increase from the prior year quarter.

Net favorable prior year reserve development of $55 million after-tax, including after-tax charges of $102 million and $79 million for asbestos and environmental reserve development, respectively.

Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, "Our company had another very strong quarter, with $1.037 billion of operating income and an operating return on equity of 17.4 percent.  All of our business segments produced solid performances, aided by the lack of any major catastrophes and the continuation of favorable reserve development.
 product and our leadership position in homeowners.
"Our top line continued to grow in each of our segments, with net written premiums increasing 4 percent.  Retentions were once again at historically high levels, and margins remain attractive.  Renewal pricing continues to increase for catastrophe-prone exposures, particularly in the Southeastern U.S.  Elsewhere, renewal pricing is generally flat.  Since retentions are high across the industry, new business flow for our commercial businesses is somewhat limited and pricing remains more competitive than renewal business.  Nevertheless, we are pleased with the growth that we are experiencing.  In the Personal Insurance segment, we are generating above average industry growth, which has been driven by the continued success of the Quantum Auto
SM
"The initiatives that we have embarked upon over the last few years are enhancing the value of our franchise.  The fundamentals of our business are strong and reflect the impressive earnings power of our company," concluded Mr. Fishman.

                See Glossary of Financial Measures for definitions and the statistical supplement for additional financial data.
Net written premiums increased 4 percent from the prior year quarter, with all three segments contributing to the growth.  This result was primarily driven by strong retention rates, especially for non-catastrophe exposures, and renewal price increases on Southeastern U.S. catastrophe-prone exposures.  For comparison of period over period growth, the impact of the increase in property catastrophe reinsurance costs reflected in the current quarter was approximately offset by the impact of reinstatement premiums associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the prior year quarter.
Net investment income in the current quarter was $668 million after-tax ($858 million pre-tax), a 7 percent increase from the prior year quarter.  The increase was primarily driven by higher fixed income rates and strong operating cash flows.
The GAAP combined ratio in the current quarter was 87.2 percent, a 29.0 point improvement from the 116.2 percent reported in the prior year quarter, primarily due to significantly lower catastrophe losses.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 1.7 points due to net favorable prior year reserve development and by 1.3 points due to the re-estimation of current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2006, partially offset by 0.3 points for catastrophe losses.  The prior year quarter GAAP combined ratio included 30.3 points for catastrophe losses related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, partially offset by the benefits of 2.0 points due to net favorable prior year reserve development and 1.4 points due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2005.
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased 2.7 million common shares for a total cost of $121 million under its $2 billion share repurchase program authorized in the second quarter of 2006.  The Company has repurchased an aggregate of 8.4 million shares for a total cost of $371 million under the program, including the repurchases during the third quarter of 2006.  Given year-to-date results, the Company intends to accelerate the pace of its share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2006.

The Company increased asbestos reserves by $155 million in the current quarter in connection with the completion of its annual asbestos review, resulting in a $102 million after-tax charge.  There were no asbestos reserve adjustments in the prior year quarter.  The previous annual asbestos review was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005.  The Company completed this year's review in the third quarter earlier than in previous years due to a number of factors, including:
the emergence of more stable payment trends for a greater proportion of policyholders,
                 
a decrease in the number of new claims received,
                 
a decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures reflecting additional settlement activity,
                 
a decrease in the number and volatility of asbestos-related bankruptcies, and
                 
the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants.
                 
As in prior years, the review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and "non-product" liability, including the on-going litigation related to ACandS.  Developing payment trends among policyholders in the Home Office and Field Office as well as Assumed and International categories were also analyzed.  The Home Office and Field Office categories, which account for the vast majority of the number of policyholders, have experienced an overall reduction in new claim filings as well as in indemnity and defense payments over prior years.  While indemnity payments declined in line with previous expectations, defense costs, although decreasing, were in excess of previous expectations.
Approximately half of the $155 million pre-tax reserve adjustment was due to an increase in projected defense costs for ten policyholders.  Additionally, $15 million of the pre-tax reserve increase was attributable to a delay in the approval and expected payment of the previously announced PPG settlement. The remainder of the reserve increase was primarily due to continued litigation activity against smaller, peripheral defendants.
The Company increased environmental reserves by $120 million, resulting in a $79 million after-tax charge.  There were no environmental reserve adjustments in the prior year quarter.  While the number of new policyholders submitting claims continues to decline, the increase to the reserve was primarily due to higher than expected defense and settlement costs driven in part by adverse judicial developments in certain states regarding the availability of coverage.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, St. Paul Travelers reported net income of $3.019 billion, or $4.37 per basic share and $4.23 per diluted share, compared to $1.443 billion, or $2.14 per basic share and $2.07 per diluted share, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005.  Net income in the prior year period was negatively impacted by a $440 million after-tax loss from discontinued operations, primarily due to a tax charge related to the Company's decision to divest its 78 percent equity interest in Nuveen.

Income from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2006 was $3.019 billion, or $4.37 per basic share and $4.23 per diluted share, compared to $1.883 billion, or $2.79 per basic share and $2.69 per diluted share, in the prior year period.  Operating income in the current year period was $3.007 billion, or $4.35 per basic share and $4.22 per diluted share, compared to $1.875 billion, or $2.78 per basic share and $2.68 per diluted share, in the prior year period.
Net and operating income for the first nine months of 2006 included an after-tax benefit of $155 million ($237 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development and an after-tax charge of $54 million ($82 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses.  In the prior year period, net and operating income included an after-tax benefit of $156 million ($232 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development and an after-tax charge of $1.037 billion ($1.566 billion pre-tax) for catastrophe losses.
The GAAP combined ratio in the current year period was 88.6 percent, a 9.3 point improvement from the 97.9 percent reported in the prior year period, primarily due to a much lower level of catastrophe losses.  The current year period GAAP combined ratio benefited by 1.5 points for net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by 0.5 points for catastrophe losses.  The prior year period GAAP combined ratio included 10.2 points for catastrophe losses, partially offset by a benefit of 1.6 points for net favorable prior year reserve development.
Net investment income in the current year period was a record $2.011 billion after-tax ($2.607 billion pre-tax), an 11 percent increase from the prior year period.  The increase was driven by higher fixed income rates, strong operating cash flows and the investment of approximately $2.4 billion of proceeds received from the sale of Nuveen in 2005.
For the first nine months of 2006, operating return on equity was 17.4 percent, compared to 11.9 percent in the prior year period.
In August 2006, the Company announced a realignment of two of its three segments.  The former Commercial and Specialty segments were realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment.  The Personal segment was renamed Personal Insurance.  The changes were designed to reflect the manner in which the Company's businesses are currently managed, and represent an aggregation of products and services based on type of customer, how the business is marketed, and the manner in which risks are underwritten.  Financial data for all periods presented has been reclassified to be consistent with the new segment structure.
Business Insurance is organized into the following groups: Select Accounts, Commercial Accounts, National Accounts, Industry-Focused Underwriting, Target Risk Underwriting, and Specialized Distribution, which collectively comprise Business Insurance Core operations.  Business Insurance also includes the Special Liability Group as well as policies written by Gulf, the Personal Catastrophe Risk operation and other runoff operations, which collectively are referred to as Business Insurance Other.

For the third quarter 2006, the Business Insurance segment reported operating income of $613 million, compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter.  The improvement was primarily due to the absence of catastrophe losses, the continuation of favorable loss trends and higher net investment income.
There were no catastrophe losses reported in the current quarter, compared to an after-tax charge of $621 million ($956 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.  Loss experience in the current accident year has trended better than originally estimated due to favorable claim activity, resulting in an after-tax benefit of $26 million ($40 million pre-tax) from the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2006.  The prior year quarter included an after-tax benefit of $33 million ($51 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2005.
Operating income in the current quarter included an after-tax charge of $35 million ($46 million pre-tax) for net unfavorable prior year reserve development.  The prior year reserve development was comprised of after-tax charges for asbestos and environmental reserve development of $102 million ($155 million pre-tax) and $79 million ($120 million pre-tax), respectively, partially offset by $146 million ($229 million pre-tax) for other net favorable prior year development, primarily due to better than expected frequency and severity loss trends in the general liability and property lines of business.  The prior year quarter included an after-tax charge of $12 million ($18 million pre-tax) for net unfavorable prior year reserve development.
The GAAP combined ratio was 92.0 percent in the current quarter, a 33.0 point improvement from the 125.0 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The improvement was primarily due to the absence of catastrophe losses in the current quarter, compared to 35.0 points for catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.  Net unfavorable prior year reserve development added 1.7 points to the current quarter GAAP combined ratio, compared to adding 0.7 points in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 1.5 points due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2006, compared to a similar benefit of 1.9 points related to the first two quarters of 2005.
Net written premiums, excluding Business Insurance Other, increased 4 percent from the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in Industry-Focused Underwriting, Commercial Accounts and Target Risk Underwriting, partially offset by a decline in National Accounts.
Within Commercial Accounts, retention rates were very strong, consistent with previous quarters, while new business volume decreased from the prior year quarter.  Renewal price changes increased in both Commercial Accounts and Target Risk Underwriting, largely related to Southeastern U.S. catastrophe-prone exposures.  Industry-Focused Underwriting benefited from strong business volumes in the Construction and Oil & Gas business units, driven by favorable economic conditions in these industry sectors.  Within Select Accounts, excluding the impact of the transfer of certain small business insurance programs to Specialized Distribution, net written premiums were approximately level with the prior year quarter.   Retention rates for Select Accounts were strong, consistent with previous quarters; renewal price changes increased from recent quarters and new business volume rose from the prior year quarter.  National Accounts net written premiums declined as a result of a reduction in premiums related to favorable loss experience on retrospectively rated policies and lower new business volume.
6
The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment ("FP&II") includes the following businesses: Bond, Financial & Professional Services, and International and Lloyd's.
For the third quarter 2006, FP&II reported operating income of $144 million, compared to $86 million in the prior year quarter.  The increase was primarily driven by the absence of catastrophe losses and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development.
There were no catastrophe losses reported in the current quarter, compared to an after-tax charge of $71 million ($80 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.  Operating income in the current quarter included a minimal benefit for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to an after-tax benefit of $28 million ($37 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.
The GAAP combined ratio was 89.0 percent in the current quarter, a 5.8 point improvement from the 94.8 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The improvement was primarily due to the absence of catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development.  Catastrophe losses added 10.1 points to the prior year quarter GAAP combined ratio.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 0.2 points for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to 4.8 points in the prior year quarter.
Net written premiums increased 8 percent from the prior year quarter, primarily due to strong business volumes in Bond and the U.K. operations, as well as the absence of catastrophe-related reinstatement premiums in the Company's Lloyd's operations.
For Financial & Professional Services and Bond, excluding the surety line of business, retention rates were strong, increasing from previous quarters; renewal price changes continue to be positive and new business volume decreased from the prior year quarter. For International, including the Company's operations in the U.K., Ireland and Canada, retention rates were very strong, renewal price changes were consistent with recent quarters and new business volume increased from the prior year quarter.
For the third quarter 2006, the Personal Insurance segment reported operating income of $341 million, compared to an operating loss of $25 million in the prior year quarter.  The improvement was primarily driven by significantly lower catastrophe losses, greater net favorable prior year reserve development, increased earned premium volume and higher net investment income.
The current quarter included an after-tax charge of $10 million ($15 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses, compared to $317 million ($488 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.  Operating income in the current quarter included an after-tax benefit of $85 million ($132 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development, primarily due to a reduction in 2005 catastrophe loss estimates.  The prior year quarter included $54 million ($83 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development.  In addition, loss experience in the current accident year has trended better than originally expected due to favorable automobile claim activity, resulting in an after-tax benefit of $17 million ($27 million pre-tax) from the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2006.  The prior year quarter included an after-tax benefit of $12 million ($19 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2005.
7
The GAAP combined ratio was 78.4 percent in the current quarter, a 32.9 point improvement from the 111.3 percent reported in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio included 0.9 points for catastrophe losses, compared to 32.1 points in the prior year quarter.  Net favorable prior year reserve development benefited the current quarter GAAP combined ratio by 7.9 points, compared to a benefit of 5.5 points in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 1.6 points due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first two quarters of 2006, compared to a similar benefit of 1.3 points related to the first two quarters of 2005.
Net written premiums increased 6 percent from the prior year quarter.  This result was attributable to continued strong retention rates, renewal price increases and growth in new business.  Net written premium growth in the current quarter was lower than in recent quarters as a result of higher catastrophe reinsurance costs for homeowners and the estimated impact of transitioning to six-month policies for new automobile business.

Automobile net written premiums increased 4 percent, and policies in force increased 11 percent from the prior year quarter.  Excluding the estimated impact of transitioning to six-month policies for new business, net written premiums would have increased approximately 9 percent. Retention rates were strong, consistent with previous quarters, and renewal price changes were level with recent quarters.

Homeowners and Other net written premiums increased 9 percent, and policies in force increased 9 percent from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates were strong, consistent with previous quarters, and renewal price changes increased slightly from recent quarters.

St. Paul Travelers is increasing its 2006 annual earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $5.50 to $5.65, compared to the previously announced range of $4.90 to $5.10.  This guidance is based on a number of assumptions, including catastrophe losses of $35 million after-tax ($55 million pre-tax) for the remainder of 2006 and no additional prior year reserve development, favorable or unfavorable.  Weighted average outstanding diluted shares are assumed to be 717 million for the full year, before the impact of any share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter.

Glossary of Financial Measures
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations.  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Return on equity
Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.

represent additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties.
Reinstatement
premiums
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development

is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the third quarter 2006:

Discontinued Operations (Asset Management)
  The Company's historical Commercial and Specialty segments have been realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment.  As a result, prior quarter results of certain businesses have been disaggregated from the historical Specialty segment and are now reported in the Business Insurance segment.  In addition, the Personal segment has been renamed Personal Insurance.
Prior quarter segment results have been reclassified from the historical presentation to conform with current business segment definitions where applicable.

Specifically, earnings guidance and statements about our share repurchase plans are forward looking, and we may make forward-looking statements about our results of operations (including, among others, premium volume, income from continuing operations, net and operating income and return on equity), financial condition and liquidity; the sufficiency of our asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); post-merger expense savings; the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage; and strategic initiatives.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: catastrophe losses could materially reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance; our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; reinsurance may not protect us against losses; we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances; if actual claims exceed our loss reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of loss reserves are necessary, our financial results could be significantly and adversely affected; the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain; we may incur loss and loss adjustment expenses as a result of disclosures by, and investigations of, companies for which we have written directors' and officers' insurance relating to possible accounting irregularities, corporate governance issues and stock option "backdating," "spring loading" and other stock option grant practices; the insurance industry, including us, is the subject of a number of investigations by state and federal authorities in the United States, and we cannot predict the outcome of these investigations or their impact on our business or financial results; our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth; assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds, catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability; a downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could significantly reduce our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our borrowing costs; our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses which could reduce our profitability; the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume; we may not be able to execute announced and future strategic initiatives as planned; the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would limit our ability to meet our obligations and to pay future dividends; loss or significant restriction of the use of credit scoring or other variables in the pricing and underwriting of personal lines products could reduce our future profitability; disruptions to our relationships with our distributors, independent agents and brokers could adversely affect our future income and profitability; if we experience difficulties with outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted; and the effects of corporate bankruptcies on surety bond claims.
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements.

The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc.
Financial Supplement - Third Quarter 2006
Business Realignment
 
In August 2006, the Company announced a realignment of two of its three reportable business segments. The former Commercial and Specialty segments were realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. The Personal segment was renamed Personal Insurance. These changes were designed to reflect the manner in which the Company's businesses are currently managed, and represent an aggregation of products and services based on type of customer, how the business is marketed, and the manner in which the risks are underwritten.  The following discussion relates to the two realigned segments.  Financial data for all periods presented has been reclassified to be consistent with the new segment structure.
 
Business Insurance
 
The Business Insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients primarily in the United States. Business Insurance is organized into the following groups, which comprise Business Insurance's Core operations collectively:
 
 -  serves small businesses and offers commercial multi-peril, property, general liability, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.
Select Accounts
 
 -  serves primarily mid-sized businesses for property and casualty products, including property, general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.  Certain units included in Commercial Accounts prior to the realignment are now included in the Industry-Focused Underwriting, Target Risk Underwriting or Specialized Distribution groups.
Commercial Accounts
 
 -  comprises three business units.  The largest provides casualty products and services to large companies, with particular emphasis on workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liability.  National Accounts also includes Discover Re, which provides unbundled property and casualty insurance products to insureds who utilize programs such as self-insurance, collateralized deductibles and captive reinsurers.  In addition, National Accounts includes the commercial residual market business, which primarily offers workers' compensation products and services to the involuntary market.
National Accounts
 
 -  . The following units serve targeted industries with differentiated combinations of insurance coverage, risk management, claims handling and other services:
Industry-Focused Underwriting
 
 -  serves a broad range of construction businesses, offering guaranteed cost products for small to mid-sized policyholders and loss sensitive programs for larger accounts.  For the larger accounts, the customer and the Company work together in actively managing and controlling exposure and claims and they share risk through policy features such as deductibles or retrospective rating.  Products offered include workers' compensation, general liability and commercial auto coverages, and other risk management solutions.
Construction
 
 -  serves small to mid-sized companies involved in telecommunications, information technology, medical technology and electronics manufacturing, offering a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of products and services.  These products include property, commercial auto, general liability, workers' compensation, umbrella, internet liability, technology errors and omissions coverages and global companion products.
Technology
 
 -  markets insurance products and services to public entities including municipalities, counties, Indian Nation gaming and selected special government districts such as water and sewer utilities. The policies written by this unit typically cover property, commercial auto, general liability and errors and omissions exposures.
Public Sector Services
 
 -  provides specialized property and liability products and services for customers involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including operators and drilling contractors, as well as various service and supply companies and manufacturers that support upstream operations. The policies written by this business group insure drilling rigs, natural gas facilities, and production and gathering platforms, and cover risks including physical damage, liability and business interruption.
Oil & Gas
 
 -  serves small to medium-sized agricultural businesses, including farms, ranches, wineries and related operations, offering property and liability coverages other than workers' compensation.
Agribusiness
 
 -  . The following units serve commercial businesses requiring specialized product underwriting, claims handling and risk management services:
Target Risk Underwriting
 
 -  serves large and mid-sized customers, including retailers, hospitals, colleges and universities, and owners of industrial parks, office buildings, apartments and amusement parks, covering losses on buildings, business assets and business interruption exposures.
National Property
 
 -  provides insurance for goods in transit and movable objects for customers such as jewelers, museums, contractors and the transportation industry.  Builders' Risk insurance is also offered to customers during the construction, renovation or repair of buildings and other structures.
Inland Marine
 
 -  serves the marine transportation industry and related services, as well as other businesses involved in international trade. The Company's product offerings fall under six main coverage categories: marine liability, cargo, hull and machinery, protection and indemnity, pleasure craft, and marine property and liability.
Ocean Marine
 
 -  serves small to mid-sized commercial businesses, offering mono-line umbrella and excess coverage where the Company does not write the primary casualty coverage, or where other business units within the Company prefer to outsource the underwriting of umbrella and excess business based on the expertise and/or limit capacity of Excess Casualty.
Excess Casualty
 
 -  serves customers ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies, offering comprehensive breakdown coverages for equipment, including property and business interruption coverages.   Through the BoilerRe unit, Boiler and Machinery also serves other property casualty carriers that do not have in-house expertise with reinsurance, underwriting, engineering, claim handling and risk management services for this type of coverage.
Boiler & Machinery
 
 -  provides insurance to U.S. companies with foreign property and liability exposures ("home-foreign"), and foreign organizations with property and liability exposures located in the United States ("reverse-flow"), as part of a global program.
Global Accounts

The Company's Personal Catastrophe Risk business had been included in the Specialty segment prior to the August 2006 segment realignment.  In accordance with the terms of the sale agreement, the Company retained responsibility for the pre-sale claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to the Personal Catastrophe Risk business and remains responsible for any changes in estimates in those reserves through a quota-share reinsurance agreement.  All of these operations are collectively referred to as Business Insurance Other.
 
Financial, Professional & International Insurance
 
The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment includes surety and financial liability coverages, which require a primarily credit-based underwriting process, as well as property and casualty products that are primarily marketed on an international basis.  The segment includes the following businesses:

The Company's operations primarily underwrite employers' liability (similar to workers' compensation coverage in the United States), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), motor (similar to automobile coverage in the United States) and property.  At , the Company underwrites four principal lines of businessaviation, marine, global property, and accident and special risksthrough Syndicate 5000, for which the Company provides 100% of the capital. During the second half of 2004, the Company made a decision to exit certain portions of the Lloyd's personal lines business and, in early 2005, sold the right to renew this business as well as the operating companies that supported it.

The Company entered into these arrangements as part of its strategy to shorten the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio. In a changing interest rate environment the change in the value of the futures contracts can be expected to partially offset changes in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio.
 
 
The Company's top five reinsurer groups, including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims. The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves. Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience and current economic conditions. Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at December 31, 2005, after deducting mandatory pool and structured settlement balances, $10.4 billion, or 78%, were rated by A.M. Best Company. Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 95% were rated A- or better. The remaining 22% net recoverables from reinsurers was comprised of the following:  5% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 7% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 10% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company. In addition, $2.4 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at December 31, 2005.
 
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in. These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market. The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state. In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion. The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable
for GAAP purposes.

Financial Supplement - Third Quarter 2006
Glossary of Financial Measures and Description of Operating Segments
 
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations. is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
 
is the ratio of net income to average equity is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity. is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Return on equity
. Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results. These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. A catastrophe may also result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
represent additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties.
Reinstatement premiums
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development. In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
 
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned. For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums. The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
 
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract. Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
 
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
 
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the third quarter 2006:
 
The Business Insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services in the United States. Business Insurance is organized into the following groups, which collectively comprise Business Insurance Core operations: Select Accounts; Commercial Accounts; National Accounts; Industry-Focused Underwriting including Construction, Technology, Public Sector Services, Oil & Gas, and Agribusiness; Target Risk Underwriting including National Property, Inland Marine, Ocean Marine, Excess Casualty, Boiler & Machinery, and Global Accounts; and Specialized Distribution including Northland, National Programs, and Underwriting Facilities. Business Insurance also includes the Special Liability Group and policies written by Gulf (primarily management and professional liability coverages), the Personal Catastrophe Risk operation and other runoff operations, which collectively are referred to as Business Insurance Other.
Business Insurance -
 
- The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment includes surety, crime, and financial liability businesses which primarily use credit-based underwriting processes, as well as property and casualty products that are predominantly marketed on an international basis. The businesses in Financial, Professional & International Insurance are Bond, Financial & Professional Services, and International and Lloyd's.
Financial, Professional & International Insurance
 
writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks. The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
Personal Insurance
 
comprisesNuveen Investments, whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed the divestiture of its ownership interest of Nuveen Investments.
Discontinued Operations (Asset Management)
 
The Company's historical Commercial and Specialty segments have been realigned into two new segments:  the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. As a result, prior quarter results of certain businesses have been disaggregated from the historical Specialty segment and are now reported in the Business Insurance segment. In addition, the Personal segment has been renamed Personal Insurance.
Prior quarter segment results have been reclassified from the historical presentation to conform with current business segment definitions where applicable.
