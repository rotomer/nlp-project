Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On November 2, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (the "Company") established the position of lead director of the Board, to be elected by secret ballot by the independent directors from among themselves when the Chairman of the Board is also the Chief Executive Officer or is a director who does not otherwise qualify as an "independent director". On November 2, 2006, the independent directors of the Board elected John H. Dasburg, a current independent director of the Company, to serve as lead director effective immediately and to serve, subject to his re-election at the May 2, 2007 annual meeting of shareholders, until the date of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders in May of 2008. The Board's lead director, among other responsibilities, will convene, set the agendas for and chair the regular executive sessions of the non-management and independent directors at which no members of management are present and provide any input to the Chairman of the Board, as may be appropriate, resulting from those sessions; convene and chair other meetings of the independent and non-management directors as may be necessary from time to time; provide direction regarding the Board meeting schedule and information to be sent to the Board and to communicate to the Chairman any input from the other directors with respect to items they wish to add to the agenda for meetings of the Board; and act as a liaison between and among directors, committee chairs, the Chairman and senior management. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board, the Board also approved an annual retainer of $25,000, payable quarterly in arrears, to the director elected to serve as lead director, in addition to any other compensation he or she is paid for Board and committee service.
