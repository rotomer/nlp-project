Item 7.01.              Regulation FD Disclosure.
As previously announced on August 1, 2006, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, relating to, among other things, the payment of contingent commissions.  Pursuant to this agreement, the Company agreed to discontinue paying contingent commissions to insurance brokers or agents on any lines of business if 65% of the United States market for that line does not pay such commissions or has signed a similar agreement.
On November 30, 2006, the Attorney General of the State of New York notified the Company that the Attorneys General had made a determination that insurers making up 65% of the United States market for homeowners multi-peril, private passenger automobile physical damage, private passenger automobile no-fault, other private passenger automobile liability, boiler and machinery and financial guaranty insurance lines do not pay contingent commissions or have signed similar agreements.  Accordingly, the Company will discontinue paying contingent commissions for such insurance lines effective January 1, 2007.  The Company is in the process of developing alternative compensation arrangements for these lines of business and remains committed to paying competitive compensation to its brokers and agents in a manner that differentiates for business performance and is consistent with the settlement and all applicable laws.  The Company does not expect today's development to have any significant impact on its results of operations.
