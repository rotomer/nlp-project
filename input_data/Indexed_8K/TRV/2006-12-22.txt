Item 7.01.              Regulation FD Disclosure.
On December 21, 2006, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania declined to confirm the Plan of Reorganization proposed as part of the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation bankruptcy proceeding.  Confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization is one of the conditions to the May 2002 agreement among The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc., approximately three dozen other insurers and PPG Industries, Inc. to settle asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG.  Pursuant to the proposed Plan of Reorganization, Pittsburgh Corning and certain specified other companies, including PPG and Corning, were to receive the protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims.
St. Paul Travelers understands that PPG is studying the bankruptcy court's decision to determine its next steps, which could include plan modifications, reconsideration by the bankruptcy court and/or appeals.  St. Paul Travelers currently does not expect that the decision of the Bankruptcy Court to decline to confirm Pittsburgh Corning's Plan of Reorganization will have any impact on the amount of St. Paul Travelers' asbestos reserves and accordingly will not have any impact on St. Paul Travelers' results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2006.
