NEWS RELEASE
 The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul Travelers," NYSE: STA) today reported net income of $1.189 billion, or $1.75 per basic share and $1.68 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared to $179 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005.  Operating income in the current quarter was $1.193 billion, or $1.75 per basic share and $1.69 per diluted share, compared to $151 million, or $0.22 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (February 1, 2007)
Net and operating income in the current quarter included after-tax benefits of $100 million ($157 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development and $43 million ($66 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2006.  Catastrophe losses negatively impacted current quarter net and operating income by $13 million after-tax ($21 million pre-tax).  In the prior year quarter, net and operating income included an after-tax charge of $372 million ($557 million pre-tax) for net unfavorable prior year reserve development, primarily due to increases to asbestos and environmental reserves, and an after-tax benefit of $45 million ($70 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2005.  Catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter negatively impacted net and operating income by $435 million after-tax ($623 million pre-tax).
Full year 2006 net income and income from continuing operations was $4.208 billion, or $6.12 per basic share and $5.91 per diluted share.  For full year 2005, net income was $1.622 billion, or $2.39 per basic share and $2.33 per diluted share, and income from continuing operations was $2.061 billion, or $3.04 per basic share and $2.95 per diluted share.  Net income in the prior year was negatively impacted by a $439 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations, primarily due to a tax charge related to the Company's divestiture of its 78 percent equity interest in Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen").  Operating income for full year 2006 was $4.200 billion, or $6.11 per basic share and $5.90 per diluted share, compared to $2.026 billion, or $2.99 per basic share and $2.90 per diluted share, in the prior year.  Catastrophe losses in the prior year negatively impacted net and operating income by $1.472 billion after-tax ($2.189 billion pre-tax).
Highlights
Operating return on equity of 19.6 percent for the quarter and 17.9 percent for the full year.

Net written premiums of $5.437 billion, a 3 percent increase from the prior year quarter.  Excluding Business Insurance Other, the Company's runoff operations, net written premiums increased 4 percent.
                 
Record net investment income of $701 million after-tax, an 11 percent increase from the prior year quarter.
                 
Strong GAAP combined ratios in all segments in the current quarter, with Business Insurance at 90.9 percent; Financial, Professional & International Insurance at 90.4 percent; and Personal Insurance at 78.1 percent. 
                 
Repurchased 14.4 million common shares for a total cost of $750 million in the quarter, under the previously authorized $2 billion share repurchase program. 
                 
Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, "We are extremely pleased with our company's performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year.  Operating income for the quarter was approximately $1.2 billion, with a very strong operating return on equity of 19.6 percent.  For the first time in our company's history, our annual revenues exceeded $25 billion.  We grew net written premiums 5 percent for the year, excluding our run-off operations, by continuing to deliver high-quality products and services to meet our agents', brokers' and customers' needs.
"In keeping with our commitment to active capital management, we repurchased $750 million of our company's stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year repurchases to more than $1.1 billion under our share repurchase program.  I am also pleased to announce that our Board has authorized an increase of $3 billion to our program, bringing the total authorization remaining to approximately $3.9 billion, or 11 percent of our outstanding shares based on yesterday's closing price.  We are targeting to complete the entire program over the next 24 months.
"Margins remained very healthy, as evidenced by our full year combined ratio of 88.1 percent.  This was driven in some measure by a benign year for catastrophe losses  the opposite of what we experienced in the preceding two years  as well as favorable reserve development.  Retentions were high throughout the year, a reflection that our customers continue to find value in their relationships with us, and new business volume was up for the year.
"Looking ahead to 2007, our company is in a great financial and competitive position, and we have the resources necessary to continue building upon our success," concluded Mr. Fishman.

Net written premiums increased 3 percent from the prior year quarter.  This result was primarily driven by strong retention rates, modest renewal price increases across most businesses and improved new business volume, due in part to initiatives to increase new business submission flow.
Net investment income in the current quarter was a record $701 million after-tax ($910 million pre-tax), an 11 percent increase from the prior year quarter.  The increase was primarily driven by higher fixed income investment returns, strong operating cash flows and greater non-fixed income investment returns.
The GAAP combined ratio in the current quarter was 86.7 percent, a 24.4 point improvement from the 111.1 percent reported in the prior year quarter. The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 3.0 points due to net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by 0.4 points for catastrophe losses.  The prior year quarter GAAP combined ratio included 12.2 points for catastrophe losses and 10.8 points for net unfavorable prior year reserve development.  In the current and prior year quarter, the re-estimation of current year loss ratios benefited the GAAP combined ratio by 1.2 and 1.4 points, respectively.
St. Paul Travelers' Board of Directors has authorized a $3 billion increase to the current share repurchase program, bringing the total remaining authorization to approximately $3.9 billion.  Under the program, repurchases may be made from time to time in the open-market, in private transactions, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise.  This program does not have a stated expiration date.  The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price, weather and other market conditions.

In the prior year, net and operating income of $1.622 billion and $2.026 billion, respectively, included after-tax charges of $216 million ($325 million pre-tax) for net unfavorable prior year reserve development and $1.472 billion ($2.189 billion pre-tax) for catastrophe losses.
The GAAP combined ratio in the current year was 88.1 percent, a 13.2 point improvement from the 101.3 percent reported in the prior year.  The current year GAAP combined ratio benefited by 1.9 points for net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by 0.5 points for catastrophe losses.  The prior year GAAP combined ratio included 10.7 points for catastrophe losses and 1.6 points for net unfavorable prior year reserve development.
Net investment income in the current year was a record $2.712 billion after-tax ($3.517 billion pre-tax), an 11 percent increase from the prior year.  The increase was driven by higher fixed income investment returns, strong operating cash flows, the investment of approximately $2.4 billion of proceeds received from the sale of Nuveen in 2005, and greater non-fixed income investment returns.
For the full year 2006, operating return on equity was 17.9 percent, compared to 9.6 percent in the prior year period.
For the fourth quarter 2006, the Business Insurance segment reported operating income of $703 million, compared to an operating loss of $110 million in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development, the absence of catastrophe losses and higher net investment income.
The current quarter included an after-tax benefit of $7 million ($14 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to an after-tax charge of $438 million ($657 million pre-tax) for net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter, due to increases to asbestos and environmental reserves.  There were no catastrophe losses reported in the current quarter, compared to an after-tax charge of $293 million ($449 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter included a minimal benefit from the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2006.  In comparison, the prior year quarter included an after-tax benefit of $32 million ($50 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2005.

The GAAP combined ratio was 90.9 percent in the current quarter, a 39.5 point improvement from the 130.4 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  There were no catastrophe losses in the current quarter, while catastrophe losses added 16.3 points to the prior year quarter GAAP combined ratio.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 0.5 points for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to an impact of 24.0 points for net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 0.3 points due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2006, compared to a benefit of 1.8 points related to the first three quarters of 2005.
Net written premiums, excluding Business Insurance Other, increased 2 percent from the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in Target Risk Underwriting and Industry-Focused Underwriting, partially offset by a decline in National Accounts.
Within Select Accounts, excluding the impact of the transfer of certain small business insurance programs to Specialized Distribution, net written premiums increased slightly from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates were strong, consistent with recent quarters; renewal price changes were positive, consistent with recent quarters; and new business volume increased from the prior year quarter.
Commercial Accounts net written premiums were level with the prior year quarter.  Retention rates continued to be strong, consistent with recent quarters; renewal price changes were slightly negative, a change from recent quarters; and new business volume increased from the prior year quarter, due to successful marketing efforts to increase submission volume.
Industry-Focused Underwriting net written premiums increased due to strong business volumes in the Construction, Technology and Oil & Gas business units, benefiting from favorable economic conditions in these industry sectors.  Growth in Target Risk Underwriting net written premiums was primarily driven by renewal price increases for catastrophe-prone exposures in National Property, Inland Marine and Ocean Marine. National Accounts net written premiums declined as a result of lower volumes in the Discover Re unit, favorable loss experience on retrospectively rated policies and lower workers' compensation rates in California.
For the fourth quarter 2006, the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment reported operating income of $175 million, compared to $57 million in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter benefited from the absence of catastrophe losses and certain positive tax impacts from non-U.S. operations.
There were no catastrophe losses reported in the current quarter, compared to an after-tax charge of $89 million ($92 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.  Operating income in the current quarter included an after-tax benefit of $3 million ($4 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to an after-tax benefit of $13 million ($18 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.

The GAAP combined ratio was 90.4 percent in the current quarter, a 7.1 point improvement from the 97.5 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The improvement was primarily due to the absence of catastrophe losses, which added 11.1 points to the prior year quarter GAAP combined ratio.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 0.4 points for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to a benefit of 2.1 points in the prior year quarter.
Gross written premiums increased 2 percent from the prior year quarter due to modest growth in all businesses, while net written premiums increased 8 percent, primarily due to the timing of certain reinsurance transactions.  Gross and net written premiums in the prior year quarter benefited from the inclusion of an extra reporting month for the Company's Lloyd's operations, which eliminated a one-month reporting lag.  Excluding this impact, gross and net written premiums increased 4 and 10 percent, respectively.
The Bond and Financial & Professional Services units have been combined and are now being reported as Bond & Financial Products.  For Bond & Financial Products, excluding the surety line of business for which the following statistics do not apply, retention rates were strong, consistent with recent quarters; renewal price changes were positive, but lower than recent quarters; and new business volume decreased from the prior year quarter, due to competitive pressures.  For International, which includes the Company's operations in the U.K., Ireland and Canada, retention rates were very strong, increasing from recent quarters; renewal price changes were positive, increasing from recent quarters; and new business volume increased slightly from the prior year quarter.
For the fourth quarter 2006, the Personal Insurance segment reported operating income of $348 million, compared to $249 million in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter benefited from lower catastrophe losses, greater net favorable prior year reserve development, increased earned premium volume, the continuation of favorable loss trends and higher net investment income.
non-catastrophe homeowners claim severity resulting in part from less than expected repair costs.  The prior year quarter included an after-tax benefit of $53 million ($82 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development.  Loss experience has trended favorably in the current accident year due to lower than expected automobile claim activity, resulting in an after-tax benefit of $37 million ($56 million pre-tax) from the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2006.  The prior year quarter included an after-tax benefit of $12 million ($19 million pre-tax) due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2005.
The current quarter included an after-tax charge of $13 million ($21 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses, compared to $53 million ($82 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter also included an after-tax benefit of $90 million ($139 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development, primarily due to better than expected automobile loss experience resulting in part from claim initiatives and
The GAAP combined ratio was 78.1 percent in the current quarter, a 6.4 point improvement from the 84.5 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  Catastrophe losses added 1.3 points to the current quarter GAAP combined ratio, compared to 5.2 points in the prior year quarter.  Net favorable prior year reserve development benefited the current quarter GAAP combined ratio by 8.2 points, compared to a benefit of 5.3 points in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 3.3 points due to the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2006, compared to a similar benefit in the prior year quarter of 1.2 points related to the first three quarters of 2005.

Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 6 percent from the prior year quarter.  This result was primarily attributable to continued strong retention rates and renewal price increases.
Automobile net written premiums increased 3 percent, and policies in force increased 10 percent from the prior year quarter.  Excluding the estimated impact of transitioning to six-month policies for new business, net written premiums would have increased approximately 6 percent.  Retention rates were strong and renewal price changes were positive, both consistent with recent quarters.  New business volume increased slightly from the prior year quarter, after adjusting for the six-month policy impact.
Homeowners and Other net written premiums increased 9 percent, and policies in force increased 8 percent from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates were strong, consistent with recent quarters, and renewal price changes increased from recent quarters. New business volume decreased from the prior year quarter, due in part to coastal risk management.
St. Paul Travelers expects 2007 earnings per diluted share in the range of $5.20 to $5.45. This guidance is based on a number of assumptions, including:
      Catastrophe losses of $530 million pre-tax and $355 million after-tax;
      No prior year reserve development, favorable or unfavorable;
      Growth in average invested assets in the low single digits, after taking into account dividends and approximately $2 billion of share repurchases for the year; and
      Weighted average diluted shares of approximately 690 million, including the impact of the assumed share repurchases and normal growth in share count from employee equity awards.

Glossary of Financial Measures
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded

in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations.  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Return on equity
Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
represent additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties.
Reinstatement premiums
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Discontinued Operations (Asset Management)
  The Company's historical Commercial and Specialty segments have been realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment.

In addition, the Personal segment has been renamed Personal Insurance.
Prior quarter segment results have been reclassified from the historical presentation to conform with current business segment definitions where applicable.
Forward Looking Statement

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, earnings guidance and statements about our share repurchase plans are forward looking, and we may make forward-looking statements about our results of operations (including, among others, premium volume, income from continuing operations, net and operating income, investment income, return on equity and combined ratio), financial condition (including, among others, invested assets and liquidity); and the sufficiency of our asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage;
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: catastrophe losses could materially reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance; our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances; if actual claims exceed our loss reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of loss reserves are necessary, our financial results could be significantly and adversely affected; the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain; reinsurance may not protect us against losses; we may incur loss and loss adjustment expenses as a result of disclosures by, and investigations of, companies for which we have written directors' and officers' insurance relating to possible accounting

In August 2006, the Company announced a realignment of two of its three reportable business segments. The former Commercial and Specialty segments were realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. The Personal segment was renamed Personal Insurance. These changes were designed to reflect the manner in which the Company's businesses are currently managed, and represent an aggregation of products and services based on type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which the risks are underwritten. The following discussion relates to the two realigned segments. Financial data for all periods presented has been reclassified to be consistent with the new segment structure.
Business Insurance
The Business Insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients primarily in the United States. Business Insurance is organized into the following groups, which comprise Business Insurance's Core operations collectively:
    serves small businesses and offers commercial multi-peril, property, general liability, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.
Select Accounts
    serves primarily mid-sized businesses for property and casualty products, including property, general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance. Certain units included in Commercial Accounts prior to the realignment are now included in the Industry-Focused Underwriting, Target Risk Underwriting or Specialized Distribution groups.
Commercial Accounts
    comprises three business units. The largest provides casualty products and services to large companies, with particular emphasis on workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liability. National Accounts also includes Discover Re, which provides property and casualty insurance products on an unbundled basis using third-party administrators for insureds who utilize programs such as collateralized deductibles, captive reinsurers and self-insurance. In addition, National Accounts includes the commercial residual market business, which primarily offers workers' compensation products and services to the involuntary market.
National Accounts
    . The following units serve targeted industries with differentiated combinations of insurance coverage, risk management, claims handling and other services:
Industry-Focused Underwriting
    serves a broad range of construction businesses, offering guaranteed cost products for small to mid-sized policyholders and loss sensitive programs for larger accounts. For the larger accounts, the customer and the Company work together in actively managing and controlling exposure and claims and they share risk through policy features such as deductibles or retrospective rating. Products offered include workers' compensation, general liability and commercial auto coverages, and other risk management solutions.
Construction
    serves small to mid-sized companies involved in telecommunications, information technology, medical technology and electronics manufacturing, offering a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of products and services. These products include property, commercial auto, general liability, workers' compensation, umbrella, internet liability, technology errors and omissions coverages and global companion products.
Technology
    markets insurance products and services to public entities including municipalities, counties, Indian Nation gaming and selected special government districts such as water and sewer utilities. The policies written by this unit typically cover property, commercial auto, general liability and errors and omissions exposures.
Public Sector Services
    provides specialized property and liability products and services for customers involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including operators and drilling contractors, as well as various service and supply companies and manufacturers that support upstream operations. The policies written by this business group insure drilling rigs, natural gas facilities, and production and gathering platforms, and cover risks including physical damage, liability and business interruption.
Oil & Gas
    serves small to medium-sized agricultural businesses, including farms, ranches, wineries and related operations, offering property and liability coverages other than workers' compensation.
Agribusiness
    . The following units serve commercial businesses requiring specialized product underwriting, claims handling and risk management services:
Target Risk Underwriting
    serves large and mid-sized customers, including retailers, hospitals, colleges and universities, and owners of industrial parks, office buildings, apartments and amusement parks, covering losses on buildings, business assets and business interruption exposures.
National Property
    provides insurance for goods in transit and movable objects for customers such as jewelers, museums, contractors and the transportation industry. Builders' risk insurance is also offered to customers during the construction, renovation or repair of buildings and other structures.
Inland Marine
    serves the marine transportation industry and related services, as well as other businesses involved in international trade. The Company's product offerings fall under six main coverage categories: marine liability, cargo, hull and machinery, protection and indemnity, pleasure craft, and marine property and liability.
Ocean Marine
    serves small to mid-sized commercial businesses, offering mono-line umbrella and excess coverage where the Company does not write the primary casualty coverage, or where other business units within the Company prefer to outsource the underwriting of umbrella and excess business based on the expertise and/or limit capacity of Excess Casualty.
Excess Casualty
    serves customers ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies, offering comprehensive breakdown coverages for equipment, including property and business interruption coverages. Through the BoilerRe unit, Boiler & Machinery also serves other property casualty carriers that do not have in-house expertise with reinsurance, underwriting, engineering, claim handling and risk management services for this type of coverage.
Boiler & Machinery
    provides insurance to U.S. companies with foreign property and liability exposures ("home-foreign"), and foreign organizations with property and liability exposures located in the United States ("reverse-flow"), as part of a global program.
Global Accounts
i
 
 
    . The following units market and underwrite their products to customers predominantly through licensed wholesale, general and program agents that manage customers' unique insurance requirements.
Specialized Distribution
    provides insurance coverage for the commercial transportation industry, as well as commercial liability and package policies for small, difficult to place specialty classes of commercial business on an admitted or excess and surplus lines basis.
Northland

National Programs
    serves small commercial businesses, offering general liability, property and commercial auto physical damage coverages on an admitted or excess and surplus lines basis.
Underwriting Facilities

The Company's Personal Catastrophe Risk operation had been included in the Specialty segment prior to the August 2006 segment realignment. All of these operations are collectively referred to as Business Insurance Other.
Financial, Professional & International Insurance
The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment includes surety and financial liability coverages, which require a primarily credit-based underwriting process, as well as property and casualty products that are primarily marketed on an international basis. The segment includes the following businesses:
    provides a wide range of customers with specialty bond and insurance products and risk management services. The range of products includes surety and fidelity bonds, employment practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. In addition, the following coverages are provided: professional liability and management liability for public corporations, private companies and not-for-profit organizations for losses caused by the negligence or misconduct of named directors and officers, professional liability for a variety of professionals, such as lawyers, design professionals and real estate agents for liability from errors and omissions committed in the course of professional conduct or practice, and a full range of property, auto, liability, fidelity and professional liability insurance for financial institutions.
Bond & Financial Products
In December 2006, the Company reached a definitive agreement to sell its Mexican surety company, Afianzadora Insurgentes, S.A. de C.V. The impact of this transaction will not be material to the Company's ongoing operations or financial results.

The operations offer specialized insurance and risk management services to several customer groups, including those in the technology, public services, and financial and professional services industry sectors. The Company's operations primarily underwrite employers' liability (similar to workers' compensation coverage in the United States), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), motor (similar to automobile coverage in the United States) and property exposures. At , the Company underwrites four principal lines of businessaviation, marine, global property, and accident and special risksthrough Syndicate 5000, for which the Company provides 100% of the capital. During the second half of 2004, the Company made a decision to exit certain portions of the Lloyd's personal lines business and, in early 2005, sold the right to renew this business as well as the operating companies that supported it.

In accordance with the Company's plan to divest its equity ownership in Nuveen Investments, the Company classified Nuveen Investments as a discontinued operation beginning in 1Q 2005. Additionally, due to the taxable nature of the transaction, the Company recorded a charge of $687 million in discontinued operations in 1Q 2005, reflecting the difference between the tax basis and the GAAP carrying value of its investment in Nuveen Investments. A $138 million after-tax gain was recorded in 2Q 2005 related to the divestiture of 45.9 million shares of Nuveen Investments. An $85 million after-tax gain was recorded in 3Q 2005 related to the divesture of the remaining 27.5 million shares of Nuveen Investments.

The Company's top five reinsurer groups, including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims. The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves. Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience and current economic conditions. Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at December 31, 2006, after deducting mandatory pool and structured settlement balances, $9.4 billion, or 78%, were rated by A.M. Best Company. Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 96% were rated A- or better. The remaining 22% net recoverables from reinsurers was comprised of the following: 6% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 6% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 10% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company. In addition, $3.3 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at December 31, 2006.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in. These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market. The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state. In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion. The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.

The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses) and discontinued operations. is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
is the ratio of net income to average equity is the ratio of income from continuing operations to average equity. is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses and discontinued operations, net of tax.
Return on equity
. Continuing operations return on equity
Operating return on equity
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results. These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. A catastrophe may also result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
represent additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties.
Reinstatement premiums
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development. In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned. For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums. The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract. Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
St. Paul Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the third quarter 2006:
The Business Insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services in the United States. Business Insurance is organized into the following groups, which collectively comprise Business Insurance Core operations: Select Accounts; Commercial Accounts; National Accounts; Industry-Focused Underwriting including Construction, Technology, Public Sector Services, Oil & Gas, and Agribusiness; Target Risk Underwriting including National Property, Inland Marine, Ocean Marine, Excess Casualty, Boiler & Machinery, and Global Accounts; and Specialized Distribution including Northland, National Programs, and Underwriting Facilities. Business Insurance also includes the Special Liability Group and policies written by Gulf (primarily management and professional liability coverages), the Personal Catastrophe Risk operation (which was sold in 2005), and other runoff operations, which collectively are referred to as Business Insurance Other.
Business Insurance -
- The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment includes surety, crime, and financial liability businesses which primarily use credit-based underwriting processes, as well as property and casualty products that are predominantly marketed on an international basis. The businesses in Financial, Professional & International Insurance are Bond & Financial Products and International and Lloyd's.
Financial, Professional & International Insurance
writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks. The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
Personal Insurance
comprises Nuveen Investments, whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed the divestiture of its ownership interest of Nuveen Investments.
Discontinued Operations (Asset Management)
The Company's historical Commercial and Specialty segments have been realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. As a result, prior quarter results of certain businesses have been disaggregated from the historical Specialty segment and are now reported in the Business Insurance segment. In addition, the Personal segment has been renamed Personal Insurance.
Prior quarter segment results have been reclassified from the historical presentation to conform with current business segment definitions where applicable.
