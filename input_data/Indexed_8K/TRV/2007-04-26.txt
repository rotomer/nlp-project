("Travelers," NYSE: TRV) today reported net income of $1.086 billion, or $1.62 per basic share and $1.56 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, compared to $1.006 billion, or $1.45 per basic share and $1.41 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.  Operating income in the current quarter was $1.078 billion, or $1.61 per basic share and $1.55 per diluted share, compared to $1.011 billion, or $1.46 per basic share and $1.41 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (April 26, 2007)
"We are delighted with our strong top and bottom line results this quarter," commented Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Many of our agents have confirmed to us that access to our organization and our industry-leading breadth of products has become easier, and we have succeeded in linking many of these products together. Consequently, new business flow for us is up. Our longstanding emphasis on sophisticated business analytics provides us with an important competitive advantage to capitalize on this opportunity. As a result, we believe we can continue to grow our business thoughtfully and profitably, realizing the benefits of the strategies that we began putting in place several years ago.
 
"Overall margins, as evidenced by our accident year loss ratios, remain at levels that are generally consistent with those that we experienced last year, and our return on equity remains attractive.  We continue to make significant strategic investments in systems, technology and infrastructure to further develop our competitive advantages.  While it is too early to predict revenue growth for the remainder of this year, we are feeling good about our income prospects and are increasing our guidance accordingly," concluded Mr. Fishman.

Net and operating income in the current quarter of $1.086 billion and $1.078 billion, respectively, included an after-tax benefit of $40 million ($62 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development and an after-tax charge of $29 million ($45 million pre-tax) for catastrophe losses. Net and operating income in the prior year quarter of $1.006 billion and $1.011 billion, respectively, included an after-tax benefit of $32 million ($49 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development.  There were no catastrophe losses reported in the prior year quarter.  
 
In the first quarter of 2007, the Company discontinued the use of performance-based contingent commissions and implemented a new performance-based fixed supplemental compensation program for all of its personal lines business.  The Company also offered the majority of its agents conducting commercial lines business the option to switch to this new program.  While the Company expects that its total payout rate for the fixed supplemental compensation program in 2007 will be substantially the same as the contingent commission program in 2006, the change to the new program has created a difference in the timing of commission expense recognition, resulting in a benefit to net and operating income during the transition year.  The impact of this change in the current quarter was to lower reported expenses by $47 million after-tax ($72 million pre-tax), primarily in Business Insurance and Personal Insurance.
 
Net and operating income in the current quarter also included an after-tax benefit of $28 million for the favorable resolution of various prior year federal tax matters, compared to an after-tax benefit of $49 million for the favorable resolution of various prior year federal and state tax matters in the prior year quarter.
 
Net written premiums increased 8 percent from the prior year quarter.  This result was primarily driven by strong retention rates, lower ceded premiums, growth in new business volume and modest renewal price increases across most businesses.
 
Net investment income in the current quarter was a record $737 million after-tax ($960 million pre-tax), a 10 percent increase from the prior year quarter.  The increase was primarily driven by higher fixed income and real estate investment returns as well as higher average invested assets due to strong operating cash flows.
The GAAP combined ratio in the current quarter was 89.2 percent, a 0.3 point increase from the 88.9 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 1.2 points due to net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by 0.9 points for catastrophe losses.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio also benefited by 1.4 points from the change to the new fixed supplemental compensation program.  The prior year quarter GAAP combined ratio included a 1.0 point benefit for net favorable prior year reserve development, and there were no catastrophe losses reported in the prior year quarter.
The current quarter GAAP loss and loss adjustment expense ratio component of the combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses and net prior year reserve development, improved 0.4 points compared to the prior year quarter ratio on the same basis.

During the first quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 13.9 million of its common shares for a total cost of $725 million under its share repurchase program.  Through March 31, 2007, the Company has repurchased an aggregate of 36.7 million shares for a total cost of $1.846 billion since the program's inception in the second quarter of 2006.  As of March 31, 2007, the total remaining authorization under the program was $3.154 billion, or approximately 9 percent of the Company's total outstanding common stock.
For the first quarter 2007, the Business Insurance segment reported operating income of $678 million, compared to $651 million in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter benefited from higher net investment income and the continuation of favorable loss trends.
The current quarter included an after-tax benefit of $17 million ($27 million pre-tax) for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to an after-tax benefit of $12 million ($19 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.  There were no catastrophe losses reported in the current or prior year quarters.  The current quarter also included an after-tax benefit of $24 million ($37 million pre-tax) due to the change to the new fixed supplemental compensation program, which created a difference in the timing of commission expense recognition.
The GAAP combined ratio was 91.5 percent in the current quarter, a 0.8 point increase from the 90.7 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio benefited by 0.9 points for net favorable prior year reserve development, compared to a benefit of 0.7 points in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter GAAP combined ratio also benefited by 1.3 points due to the change to the new fixed supplemental compensation program.
Net written premiums increased 7 percent from the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in new business volume.  Overall, retention rates were strong and renewal price changes remained relatively modest, both consistent with recent quarters.
, an enhanced quote-to-issue agency platform and multivariate pricing program.
Select Accounts net written premiums increased 3 percent from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates were strong, consistent with recent quarters, and renewal price changes were positive, but lower than recent quarters.  New business volume increased significantly from the prior year quarter due in part to the introduction in 10 states of TravelersExpress
SM
Commercial Accounts net written premiums increased 11 percent from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates continued to be strong, consistent with recent quarters, and renewal price changes were slightly negative.  New business volume increased significantly from the prior year quarter due to new product introductions, the selling of additional products to existing customers, and greater submission volume as a result of increased marketing efforts.
Industry-Focused Underwriting net written premiums increased 12 percent from the prior year quarter due to strong business volumes in Construction, Technology, Oil & Gas and

Public Sector.  Target Risk Underwriting net written premiums increased 5 percent from the prior year quarter due to strong business volumes in Inland Marine.  Specialized Distribution net written premiums increased 3 percent from the prior year quarter, and National Accounts net written premiums decreased 5 percent from the prior year quarter.

The GAAP combined ratio was 89.4 percent in the current quarter, a 1.4 point increase from the 88.0 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  There were no catastrophe losses or prior year reserve development reported in the current or prior year quarters.
Gross written premiums increased 4 percent from the prior year quarter due to strong construction surety business volumes and adjustments to prior year premium estimates for the Company's operations at Lloyd's.  Net written premiums increased 17 percent from the prior year quarter due to gross written premium growth, increases in net retentions for certain lines of business, the timing of certain reinsurance transactions and lower reinsurance costs.
For Bond & Financial Products, excluding the surety line of business, retention rates were very strong, increasing from recent quarters; renewal price changes were positive; and new business volume decreased from the prior year quarter due to competitive pricing in liability lines.  These metrics are not relevant for the surety line of business because these products are sold on a non-recurring, project-specific basis.
For International and Lloyd's, retention rates were very strong, consistent with recent quarters; renewal price changes were slightly positive, consistent with recent quarters; and new business volume decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting competitive market conditions.
For the first quarter 2007, the Personal Insurance segment reported operating income of $266 million, compared to $240 million in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter benefited from renewal price increases, higher earned premium volume, the continuation of favorable loss trends, net favorable prior year reserve development and higher net investment income, partially offset by catastrophe losses.

The current quarter GAAP combined ratio also benefited by 1.9 points due to the change to the new fixed supplemental compensation program.
Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 6 percent from the prior year quarter.  This result was primarily attributable to continued strong retention rates and renewal price increases.
Automobile net written premiums increased 4 percent, and policies in force increased 7 percent from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates were strong and renewal price changes were positive, both consistent with recent quarters.  New business volume decreased from the prior year quarter.

Glossary of Financial Measures
The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses).  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.  is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
Return on equity
Operating return on equity
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
7
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
Travelers has organized its businesses into the following operating and reporting segments, beginning with the third quarter 2006:
: The Business Insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services in the United States.  Business Insurance is organized into the following groups, which collectively comprise Business Insurance Core operations: Select Accounts; Commercial Accounts; National Accounts; Industry-Focused Underwriting including Construction, Technology, Public Sector Services, Oil & Gas and Agribusiness; Target Risk Underwriting including National Property, Inland Marine, Ocean Marine, Excess Casualty, Boiler & Machinery and Global Accounts; and Specialized Distribution including Northland and National Programs.  Business Insurance also includes the Special Liability Group and policies written by Gulf (primarily management and professional liability coverages) and other runoff operations, which collectively are referred to as Business Insurance Other.
Business Insurance
: The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment includes surety, crime, and financial liability businesses, which primarily use credit-based underwriting processes, as well as property and casualty products that are predominantly marketed on an international basis.  The businesses in Financial, Professional & International Insurance are Bond & Financial Products and International and Lloyd's.
Financial, Professional & International Insurance
: The Personal Insurance segment writes virtually all types of property and casualty insurance covering personal risks.  The primary coverages in this segment are personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals.
Personal Insurance
  The Company's historical Commercial and Specialty segments have been realigned into two new segments: the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment.  As a result, prior quarter results of certain businesses have been disaggregated from the historical Specialty segment and are now reported in the Business Insurance segment.  In addition, the Personal segment has been renamed Personal Insurance.
Prior quarter segment results have been reclassified from the historical presentation to conform with current business segment definitions where applicable.

Forward Looking Statement
This press release contains, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, earnings guidance and statements about our share repurchase plans are forward looking, and we may make forward-looking statements about our results of operations (including, among others, premium volume, income from continuing operations, net and operating income, investment income, return on equity and combined ratio), financial condition (including, among others, invested assets and liquidity); and the sufficiency of our asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage; catastrophe losses; and strategic initiatives.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: catastrophe losses could materially reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance; if actual claims exceed our loss reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of loss reserves are necessary, our financial results could be significantly and adversely affected; our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances; the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain; reinsurance may be unavailable on acceptable terms, and we may be unable to collect reinsurance; the insurance industry is the subject of a number of investigations by state and federal authorities in the United States, and we cannot predict the outcome of these investigations or their impact on our business or financial results; our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth; a downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could significantly reduce our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our borrowing costs; our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses which could reduce our profitability; the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume; the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations and to pay future dividends; assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds, catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability; loss or significant restriction of the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal Insurance products could reduce our future profitability; disruptions to our relationships with our distributors, independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us; and if we experience difficulties with outsourcing relationships, technology and/or data security, our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted.
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements.  For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the caption "Risk Factors" in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Company's top five reinsurer groups, including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience and current economic conditions.  Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at March 31, 2007, after deducting mandatory pool and structured settlement balances, $8.9 billion, or 78%, were rated by A.M. Best Company.  Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 97% were rated A- or better.  The remaining 22% net recoverables from reinsurers was comprised of the following:  6% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 8% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 8% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company.  In addition, $3.2 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at March 31, 2007.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.

The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses).  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
is the ratio of net income to average equity  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax. 
Return on equity
.
Operating return on equity
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. 
Underwriting gain (loss)
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may also result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
GAAP combined ratio
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
Gross written premiums
represents assets less liabilities and preferred shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share

  The Company's historical Commercial and Specialty segments have been realigned into two new segments:  the Business Insurance segment and the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment.  As a result, prior quarter results of certain businesses have been disaggregated from the historical Specialty segment and are now reported in the Business Insurance segment.  In addition, the Personal segment has been renamed Personal Insurance.
Prior quarter segment results have been reclassified from the historical presentation to conform with current business segment definitions where applicable.
