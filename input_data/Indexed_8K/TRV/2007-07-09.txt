SAINT PAUL, Minn., July 6, 2007  The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV) today announced that it has entered into a settlement to resolve fully all current and future asbestos-related coverage claims against Travelers and its subsidiaries relating to ACandS, Inc.  Under the settlement agreement, Travelers will contribute $449 million to a trust to be established pursuant to ACandS' plan of reorganization.  In connection with the settlement, Travelers expects to cede approximately $84 million to its reinsurers, for a net settlement of $365 million.  Travelers will fund the settlement from its existing asbestos reserves and does not anticipate any impact on earnings as a result of the settlement.
