NEWS RELEASE
 
 The Travelers Companies, Inc. ("Travelers," NYSE: TRV) today reported net income of $1.063 billion, or $1.67 per basic share and $1.64 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.189 billion, or $1.75 per basic share and $1.68 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2006.  Operating income in the current quarter was $1.057 billion, or $1.66 per basic share and $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $1.193 billion, or $1.75 per basic share and $1.69 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (January 29, 2008)
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $4.601 billion, or $7.04 per basic share and $6.86 per diluted share, compared to $4.208 billion, or $6.12 per basic share and $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Operating income in the current year was $4.500 billion, or $6.89 per basic share and $6.71 per diluted share, compared to $4.200 billion, or $6.11 per basic share and $5.90 per diluted share, in the prior year.  Net and operating income per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively, from the prior year.
 
"Travelers produced another strong quarter, concluding a year of excellent performance and execution for our company," said Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We delivered an operating return on equity of nearly 18 percent for the second consecutive year, while simultaneously making investments that are necessary for the long-term growth of our business.  The underwriting results in each of our business segments were solid, resulting in a full year combined ratio of 87.4 percent.
 
"Our capital position and liquidity are very strong which, when combined with our low leverage and our high quality investment portfolio, position us extremely well.  For the year, book value per share increased by 14 percent after repurchasing approximately $2.9 billion of common stock and paying dividends of $738 million.  As we currently anticipate completing our current common share repurchase authorization in the first or second quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $5.0 billion of common share repurchases.
 
"We enter 2008 in a position of strength, both financially and operationally, and will utilize this strength to write attractive business opportunities while always remaining highly disciplined in our underwriting," concluded Mr. Fishman.

Net and operating income in the current quarter of $1.063 billion and $1.057 billion, respectively, benefited from strong underwriting results and solid investment performance.  The current and prior year quarters included the following:
 
 
Net favorable prior year development in the current quarter was primarily driven by better than expected loss performance in each of the company's segments.  The re-estimation of the current year loss ratio for the first three quarters of 2007 was driven by better frequency and severity in Business Insurance.  In the prior year quarter, the company fully redeemed its St. Paul Capital Trust 7.6% Trust Preferred Securities, resulting in a benefit to net and operating income.
Net written premiums in the current quarter, which decreased by 1 percent from the prior year quarter, were level with the prior year quarter when adjusted for the March 2007 sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes, the company's Mexican surety operation, and the April 2007 sale of Mendota, the company's non-standard personal auto operation.  Overall, retention rates continued to be extremely strong, renewal price changes were slightly weaker than recent quarters and new business volumes decreased from the prior year quarter due to the company's disciplined underwriting in a somewhat more competitive new business market.
 
Net investment income in the current quarter was $696 million after-tax ($882 million pre-tax), essentially level with the prior year quarter of $701 million after-tax ($910 million pre-tax).  Average invested assets in the current quarter of $75.2 billion were up 3 percent from the prior year quarter even after share repurchases during the year of $2.9 billion, due to continued strong operating cash flows.  The after-tax annualized yield on the portfolio was 3.7 percent in the current quarter as compared to 3.9 percent in the prior year quarter.  This small decrease in the yield resulted from modestly lower returns in the non-fixed income portion of the portfolio from the prior year quarter.
 
The GAAP combined ratio in the current quarter was 88.4 percent, a 1.7 point increase from the 86.7 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The GAAP combined ratios included the following:
 
Net and operating income were $4.601 billion and $4.500 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The current and prior years included the following:
The current year included the timing impact for the transition to the fixed, value-based agent compensation program adopted in first quarter 2007, which lowered reported expenses from what otherwise would have been reported.  In April 2007, the company redeemed its 4.50% convertible junior subordinated notes due in 2032, resulting in a charge to net and operating income.  The redemption of these securities slightly increased the full year earnings per diluted share due to the elimination of their dilutive effect.  In the prior year, the company fully redeemed its St. Paul Capital Trust 7.6% Trust Preferred Securities, resulting in a benefit to net and operating income.
 
The GAAP combined ratio in the current year was 87.4 percent, a 0.7 point improvement from the 88.1 percent reported in the prior year.  The GAAP combined ratios included the following:
 
Net investment income in the current year was $2.9 billion after-tax ($3.8 billion pre-tax), a 7 percent increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher average invested assets due to strong operating cash flows and improved returns on both the fixed income and non-fixed income portions of the portfolio.
 
Net written premiums increased 2 percent from the prior year, or 3 percent when adjusted for the sales of Afianzadora Insurgentes and Mendota.
 
For the full year 2007, operating return on equity was 17.7 percent, compared to 17.9 percent in the prior year.
Travelers' Board of Directors has approved an additional $5.0 billion of common share repurchases, bringing the total remaining authorization to approximately $5.9 billion.  Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open-market, in private transactions, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise.  This authorization does not have a stated expiration date.  The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price, catastrophe experience and other market conditions.
 
During the fourth quarter 2007, the company repurchased 19.0 million of its common shares under its share repurchase authorization for a total cost of $1.0 billion.  Since the first Board authorization in the second quarter of 2006, the company has repurchased 78.8 million shares for a total cost of $4.1 billion.
 
The company remains very well capitalized, with all of its financial strength indicators at or better than the company's target levels.  The company ended 2007 with shareholders' equity of $26.6 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the prior year end, after share repurchases and dividends totaling $3.7 billion. Statutory surplus was $22.9 billion at the end of 2007, an increase of 9 percent compared to the prior year end.  The company's debt to capital ratio (excluding FAS115) at year end was 19.4 percent as compared to its 20.0 percent target level, and holding company liquidity at year end was $1.6 billion or $0.5 billion above the company's target level.
 
For the fourth quarter 2007, the Business Insurance segment reported operating income of $729 million, compared to $703 million in the prior year quarter.  The current and prior year quarters included the following:
 
 
Net favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter was primarily driven by better than expected frequency and severity trends for recent accident years in the commercial auto, property, commercial multi-peril and general liability product lines.  Catastrophe losses in the current quarter resulted from wildfires in California.  The re-estimation of the current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2007 was primarily driven by better than expected frequency and severity, largely in the property product line.
The GAAP combined ratio was 87.8 percent in the current quarter, a 3.1 point improvement from the 90.9 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The GAAP combined ratios included the following:
 
Net written premiums declined 2 percent from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates continued to be extremely strong, renewal price changes were slightly lower than recent quarters and new business volumes were lower than in the prior year quarter.
 
Retention rates remained very strong, and renewal price changes were positive, consistent with recent quarters.  New business volume increased slightly from the prior year quarter due to the introduction of Travelers earlier in the year, an enhanced quote-to-issue agency platform and multivariate pricing program for the smaller business end of Select Accounts. This increase was partially offset by lower new business volumes in the larger end of Select Accounts.
 
Select Accounts net written premiums decreased 2 percent from the prior year quarter.
Express
SM
 
Commercial Accounts net written premiums were level with the prior year quarter.  Retention rates continued to be very strong, renewal price changes were negative and new business volume declined from the prior year quarter.  National Accounts net written premiums decreased 14 percent from the prior year quarter due in part to the continued competitive marketplace for large accounts and, to a lesser extent, favorable loss experience on retrospectively rated policies.  Industry-Focused Underwriting net written premiums decreased 2 percent from the prior year quarter due primarily to lower new business volumes in Construction and Technology.  Target Risk Underwriting net written premiums decreased 3 percent from the prior year quarter largely due to lower new business volumes in Inland Marine and Ocean Marine.  Specialized Distribution net written premiums increased 1 percent from the prior year quarter due to increased retention and new business volume in National Programs.
 
For the fourth quarter 2007, the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment reported operating income of $184 million, compared to $175 million in the prior year quarter.   The current and prior year quarters included the following:
 
The net favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter was primarily driven by better than expected loss development in the commercial auto, employers' liability and professional liability product lines within International.
 
The GAAP combined ratio was 85.3 percent in the current quarter, a 5.1 point improvement from the 90.4 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  This improvement was driven in part by solid current year underwriting results.  The GAAP combined ratios included the following:
 
 
Net written premiums were consistent with the prior year quarter, but increased 2 percent when adjusted for the sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes.  This result was primarily driven by favorable rates of exchange, strong retention rates and renewal price changes that were consistent with recent trends and higher new business volumes.
 
For Bond & Financial Products, retention rates were strong and higher than recent quarters, renewal price changes were slightly negative and new business volumes decreased from the prior year quarter. These metrics exclude the surety line of business since these products are sold on a non-recurring, project-specific basis.
 
Bond & Financial Products net written premiums decreased 5 percent from the prior year quarter, or decreased 2 percent when adjusted for the sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes.
 
International net written premiums increased 10 percent from the prior year quarter, primarily due to favorable rates of exchange and strong business volumes at Lloyd's. Retention rates were strong and higher than recent quarters, renewal price changes were slightly negative, but consistent with recent quarters and new business volume increased significantly from the prior year quarter, driven by the company's operations at Lloyd's and in Canada.
 
 
 
For the fourth quarter 2007, the Personal Insurance segment reported operating income of $201 million compared to $348 million in the prior year quarter. Current accident year results were strong in the current quarter and consistent with the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating income primarily resulted from lower net favorable prior year reserve development, the absence of favorable re-estimation of current year loss ratios and a higher level of catastrophe and non-catastrophe related weather losses in the current quarter.
 
 
Net favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter was primarily driven by better than expected auto loss performance resulting in part from claim initiatives previously instituted. The prior year quarter also benefited from these claim initiatives at significantly higher levels, which resulted in net favorable prior year reserve development and the re-estimation of that year's loss ratio.  Catastrophe losses in the current quarter were mostly due to wildfires in California.
 
The GAAP combined ratio was 90.8 percent in the current quarter, a 12.7 point increase from the 78.1 percent reported in the prior year quarter.  The GAAP combined ratios included the following:
 
 
Personal Insurance net written premiums, which were level with the prior year quarter, increased by 2 percent when adjusted for the sale of Mendota.  This result was primarily attributable to continued strong retention rates, positive renewal price increases and higher new business volume.
 
Automobile net written premiums and policies in force both increased 1 percent from the prior year quarter when adjusted for Mendota.  Retention rates were strong and renewal price changes were positive, both consistent with recent quarters.  New business volume increased slightly from the prior year quarter, adjusted for Mendota, due to the continued success of QuantumAuto, the company's multivariate pricing product, which is now offered in 39 states and the District of Columbia.
SM
 
 
Homeowners and Other net written premiums and policies in force both increased 3 percent from the prior year quarter.  Retention rates were strong and renewal price changes were positive, both consistent with recent quarters.  New business volume decreased from the prior year quarter as ongoing coastal risk management initiatives more than offset new business growth in non-coastal areas.
 
Travelers expects 2008 operating income per diluted share in the range of $5.40 to $5.75. This range generates an approximate operating return on equity of 13 percent to 14 percent.  This guidance is based on a number of assumptions, including:
 
Catastrophe losses of $525 million pre-tax and $340 million after-tax, or $0.55 per diluted share;
                 
No prior year reserve development, favorable or unfavorable;
                 
Growth in average invested assets in the low single digits, after taking into account dividends and approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases for the year; and
                 
Weighted average diluted shares of approximately 618 million, including the impact of assumed share repurchases and normal growth in shares outstanding from employee equity awards.

Glossary of Financial Measures
 
The following measures are used by the company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the company's financial performance.
 
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses).  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.  is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax.
Operating income (loss)
Operating income (loss) per share
Return on equity
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
Underwriting gain (loss)
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
Loss reserve development
 
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.

impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses (i.e., excluding FAS 115), divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets (i.e. net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax), which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. is adjusted book value per share excluding the after-tax value of goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the company's management, tangible book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes certain effects of purchase accounting (i.e., goodwill and other intangible assets), in addition to the effect of changing prices on invested assets.
Tangible book value per share

Forward Looking Statement
 
This press release contains, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, earnings guidance, statements about our share repurchase plans and statements about the potential impact of the recent disruption in the sub-prime markets on our investment portfolio and underwriting results are forward looking, and we may make forward-looking statements about our results of operations (including, among others, premium volume, net and operating income, investment income, return on equity and combined ratio), and financial condition (including, among others, invested assets and liquidity); the sufficiency of our asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage; catastrophe losses; investment performance; market conditions; and strategic initiatives.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
 
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: catastrophe losses could materially reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance; if actual claims exceed our loss reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of loss reserves are necessary, our financial results could be significantly and adversely affected; our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims, such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances;
 
 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain; reinsurance may be unavailable on acceptable terms, and we may be unable to collect reinsurance; the insurance industry is the subject of a number of investigations by state and federal authorities in the United States, and we cannot predict the outcome of these investigations or their impact on our business or financial results; our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth; a downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could significantly reduce our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our borrowing costs; our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses which could reduce our profitability; the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume; the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations and to pay future dividends; assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds, catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability; loss or significant restriction of the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal Insurance products could reduce our future profitability; disruptions to our relationships with our distributors, independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us; if we experience difficulties with outsourcing relationships, technology and/or data security, our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted; and a significant increase in the interest rate environment, changes in regulatory or rating agency capital requirements or significant and adverse changes in the creditworthiness of corporate or municipal issuers of debt or the market for such debt, could adversely affect our investment portfolio and underwriting results.
 
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements.  For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the caption "Risk Factors" in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Company entered into these arrangements as part of its strategy to shorten the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio.  In a changing interest rate environment the change in the value of the futures contracts can be expected to partially offset changes in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio.
 
 
 
The Company's top five reinsurer groups, including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience and current economic conditions.  Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at December 31, 2007, after deducting mandatory pool and structured settlement balances, $7.7 billion, or 77%, were rated by A.M. Best Company.  Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 96% were rated A- or better.  The remaining 23% net recoverables from reinsurers were comprised of the following:  7% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 8% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 8% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company.  In addition, $3.0 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at December 31, 2007.
 
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
The structured settlements represent annuities that are purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  The Company retains the ultimate liability to the claimant in the event that the assigned company fails to pay, so the amount is reflected as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes.

The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
Operating income (loss)
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses).  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss) per share
 
Return on equity
is the ratio of net income to average equity  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax. 
.
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
Underwriting gain (loss)
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. 
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics.  Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount in advance, and therefore their effects are not included in earnings or claims and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence.  A catastrophe may also result in the payment of reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.

Loss reserve development
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of prior year loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior year and current year development on current earnings and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 
GAAP combined ratio
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net premiums earned.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
 
Gross written premiums
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.
 
Book value per share
is total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.  is total common shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses (i.e., excluding FAS 115), divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, (i.e., net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax) which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
