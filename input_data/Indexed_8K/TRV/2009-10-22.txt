  The Travelers Companies, Inc. ("Travelers," NYSE: TRV) today reported net income of $935 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, compared to $214 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Operating income in the current quarter was $914 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, compared to $330 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.
NEW YORK, October 22, 2009
 
We are pleased to report strong third quarter operating income of $914 million and operating return on equity of 14.1%," commented Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These results were driven by underwriting profitability in each of our business segments and increased net investment income, as our non-fixed income portfolio yield improved to a positive level.
"
 
"We were once again successful in achieving positive renewal rate changes across all of our business segments, although net written premiums were down modestly, largely attributable to declining economic activity in recent quarters.  As in previous quarters, we remain cautious about the magnitude of rate gains that are achievable in the near term given general economic conditions.  Nonetheless, we plan to continue to seek rate gains where needed and we will continue to focus on execution.  Solid retention and new business levels continue to underscore our strong position in the marketplace.
 
"With improved stability in the capital markets we deployed excess liquidity that we accumulated over the past several quarters.  We repurchased $1 billion of common shares in the quarter in contrast to our past practice of reduced share repurchases during the catastrophe season.  Furthermore, our guidance for 2009 now includes an assumption of $1.5 billion in common share repurchases in the fourth quarter, an increase from our previous assumption, subject to market conditions and other factors. This change, in combination with our year-to-date performance, has resulted in an increase in our guidance for full year 2009 operating income per diluted share to $5.30-$5.50 from $4.80-$5.05.
 
"Given our strong earnings performance and cash position and more stable capital markets, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 10 percent to $0.33 per share.  In addition our Board of Directors has approved an additional $6.0 billion of common share repurchases. Confidence in our strong balance sheet, ability to execute in the marketplace and our strategy of returning excess capital enable us to continue to create shareholder value," concluded Mr. Fishman.
 
See Glossary of Financial Measures for definitions and the statistical supplement for additional financial data.
 
The current and prior year quarters included the following:
 
 
The current quarter underwriting gain reflects a GAAP combined ratio, excluding net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, of 92.5 percent, as compared to 91.8 percent in the prior year quarter. This increase of 0.7 points primarily resulted from reduced underwriting margins related to pricing and loss cost trends, higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses within Personal Insurance as well as the impact of the company's recently announced direct to consumer initiative. The GAAP combined ratio in the current quarter benefited from 1.3 points of favorable re-estimation of current year loss ratios which reflects better than expected frequency trends in Business Insurance for the first two quarters of the year.
 
Net favorable prior year reserve development in the current quarter resulted from better than expected loss experience in each segment, particularly in Business Insurance. The net favorable prior year development in Business Insurance included a $120 million after-tax ($185 million pre-tax) increase to asbestos reserves that was primarily driven by a slight increase in the company's assumption for projected defense costs related to many policyholders. Overall, the company's assessment of the underlying asbestos environment did not change significantly from recent periods.
 
Catastrophe losses in the current quarter, which were considerably lower than the prior year quarter, were related to multiple severe weather events across various regions of the United States.
 
The investment portfolio, which grew to $76 billion at the end of the current quarter reflective of an increase to net unrealized investment gains of $2.1 billion pre-tax from June 30, 2009, performed very well during the quarter. Net investment income in the current quarter increased from the prior year quarter for the first time since the third
 
quarter 2007, despite lower short-term interest rates. This increase was driven by positive returns in the non-fixed income portfolio in the current quarter, compared to negative returns in the prior year quarter, and is primarily due to improved investment market conditions for hedge funds and private equity funds. Net investment income in the fixed income portfolio declined slightly from the prior year quarter due to a 150 basis point reduction in average after-tax short-term interest rates. The current quarter results also include net realized investment gains compared to net realized investment losses in the prior year quarter. The current quarter included other-than-temporary impairments of only $12 million after-tax ($19 million pre-tax), compared to $102 million after-tax ($156 million pre-tax) in the prior year quarter.
 
Net written premiums of $5.340 billion in the current quarter declined 3 percent from the prior year quarter. Business retention remained at high levels. Renewal rate changes were positive in each business segment, more than offsetting the impact of lower coverage demands from existing policyholders due to general economic conditions. New business volumes were down slightly from the prior year quarter as modest growth in Business Insurance and Financial, Professional and International Insurance was offset by lower volumes in Personal Insurance.
 
"This quarter once again demonstrated the company's significant balance sheet strength," said Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. "During the current quarter we grew shareholders' equity by 5 percent to $28.2 billion after returning $1.2 billion to our shareholders through common share dividends and common share repurchases.  As further acknowledgement of our balance sheet strength, during the quarter S&P affirmed our financial strength ratings of AA- and debt ratings of A- and revised the outlook for these ratings to positive from stable with a one year time horizon for consideration of an upgrade."
 
At the end of the third quarter 2009, all of the company's financial strength indicators were at or better than target levels. Statutory surplus was $22.1 billion, the company's debt to capital ratio of 20.1 percent (excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses) was at its target level and holding company liquidity of $2.6 billion was more than twice the company's target level.
 
Travelers' Board of Directors has approved an additional $6.0 billion of common share repurchases. This amount is in addition to the $2.1 billion that remained from previous authorizations as of September 30, 2009.  Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open-market, in private transactions, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise.  This authorization does not have a stated expiration date.  The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price, catastrophe experience and other market conditions.
 
The Board of Directors also declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.33 per common share.  This dividend, which is $0.03 higher than the last regular quarterly dividend, is payable December 31, 2009, to shareholders of record as of the close of business December 10, 2009.
 
 
"We continue to focus on effective execution and further strengthening our position in the marketplace," said Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer.  "This has enabled us to once again achieve positive renewal rate change, strong retentions and overall attractive margin levels within Business Insurance.  Furthermore, lower than expected frequency trends have resulted in better than expected loss cost trends. Although we continue to see the impact of the economic downturn in many of our businesses, we remain pleased with the results in the quarter."
 
The current and prior year quarters included the following:
 
 
The current quarter underwriting gain reflects a GAAP combined ratio, excluding net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, of 92.9 percent, as compared to 92.7 percent in the prior year quarter. This increase of 0.2 points primarily resulted from reduced underwriting margins related to pricing and loss cost trends, partially offset by 2.8 points of favorable re-estimation of current year loss ratios due to better than expected frequency trends for the first two quarters of the year.
 
Net favorable prior year reserve development in the current quarter primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in the general liability, commercial multi-peril and commercial automobile product lines for recent accident years.
 
Business Insurance net written premiums of $2.611 billion in the current quarter declined 5 percent from the prior year quarter. This decline was driven in large part by premium refunds and mid-term cancellations as a result of lower levels of economic activity during the preceding 12 months. Retention rates remained strong, although slightly lower than recent quarters. Renewal rate trends continued to improve and overall renewal rate changes were positive in the current quarter. However, renewal premium changes were slightly negative as the impact of the positive rate changes was offset by lower coverage demands from existing policyholders due to general economic conditions. New business volumes increased modestly from the prior year quarter.
 
Select Accounts
 
Net written premiums of $655 million declined 1 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to general economic conditions.
                 
Retention rates remained strong, although slightly lower than recent quarters.
                 
Renewal premium changes remained positive and improved from recent quarters as a result of a continued improving renewal rate trend.
                 
 
New business volumes declined from the prior year quarter as continued strong growth from the success and expansion of Travelers, the company's enhanced quote-to-issue agency platform and multivariate pricing program for smaller businesses, was offset by lower volumes in larger accounts served by Select.
                 
Express
SM
 
Commercial Accounts
 
Net written premiums of $609 million declined 4 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to general economic conditions.
                 
Retention rates remained strong and consistent with the prior year quarter.
                 
Renewal premium changes, although slightly negative, were improved from recent quarters as the impact of improving renewal rate trend was partially offset by lower coverage demands from existing policyholders.
                 
New business volumes increased from the prior year quarter due to the impact of various product and customer initiatives.
                 
 
National Accounts
 
Net written premiums of $197 million declined 18 percent from the prior year quarter due to renewal premium changes that were negative, driven by lower coverage demands from existing policyholders, as well as lower premium volume from industry property and workers' compensation involuntary residual markets.
                 
 
Industry-Focused Underwriting
 
Net written premiums of $564 million declined 8 percent from the prior year quarter due to the effect of current market conditions in Technology, Construction and Public Sector.
                 
 
Target Risk Underwriting
 
Net written premiums of $360 million declined 2 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower new business volumes in Inland Marine, partially offset by continued positive renewal premium changes and strong retention rates in National Property.
                 
 
Specialized Distribution
 
Net written premiums of $221 million declined 3 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to weakness in the commercial trucking industry and continuing competition from standard markets and other distribution channels.
                 
 
"Performance within Financial, Professional & International Insurance demonstrated the impact of our disciplined underwriting," said Mr. MacLean.  "Within our management liability and International businesses, loss costs were at or better than expected and we generally achieved positive renewal rate change where margins indicate it is needed.  The construction surety business continues to be impacted by the slow down
 
in construction spending, but our high quality credit profile has allowed us to maintain our underwriting margins."
 
The current and prior year quarters included the following:
 
 
The current quarter underwriting gain reflects a GAAP combined ratio, excluding net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, of 91.1 percent, as compared to 93.8 percent in the prior year quarter. This improvement of 2.7 points primarily resulted from a lower amount of large losses within International, partially offset by a change in business mix within Bond & Financial Products due to lower construction surety volumes.
 
The net favorable prior year reserve development in the current quarter resulted from better than expected loss experience across various lines of business within International.
 
Financial, Professional & International Insurance net written premiums of $870 million declined 3 percent from the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, net written premiums declined 1 percent primarily due to lower business volumes in the construction surety and professional liability businesses in the Bond & Financial Products group, partially offset by growth in International.
 
Retention rates, renewal premium changes and new business volumes as discussed below exclude the surety line of business because these products are sold on a non-recurring, project specific basis.
 
Bond & Financial Products
 
Net written premiums of $574 million declined 6 percent from the prior year quarter primarily reflecting lower business volumes in construction surety, due to reduced public construction project activity, and disciplined underwriting actions in professional liability.
                 
Retention rates remained strong, although down from recent quarters primarily in professional liability due to underwriting actions.
                 
Renewal premium changes were positive, compared to flat in the prior year quarter, as the impact of a continued improving renewal rate trend was partially offset by reduced
                 
 
exposures related to underwriting actions and lower coverage demands from existing policyholders.
New business volumes declined slightly from the prior year quarter.
                 
 
International
 
Net written premiums of $296 million increased 1 percent from the prior year quarter. After adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, net written premiums increased 9 percent primarily due to results at the company's Lloyd's operations and in Ireland.
                 
Retention rates were slightly lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to underwriting actions taken in the United Kingdom and the company's operations at Lloyd's.
                 
Renewal premium changes were positive, compared to slightly negative in the prior year quarter, as the impact of a continued improving renewal rate trend was partially offset by lower coverage demands from existing policyholders.
                 
New business volumes increased from the prior year quarter driven primarily by the personal lines business in Ireland.
                 
 
 
"Our Personal Insurance business continues to demonstrate sound fundamentals and sustained earnings power," said Mr. MacLean. "We are generally encouraged by the firming rate environment within the automobile marketplace and are seeing solid growth and profitability in homeowners."
 
The current and prior year quarters included the following:
 
 
The current quarter underwriting gain reflects a GAAP combined ratio, excluding net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, of 92.7 percent, as compared to 89.2 percent in the prior year quarter.  This increase of 3.5 points primarily resulted from higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and the impact of the company's recently announced direct to consumer initiative.
 
Net favorable prior year reserve development in the current quarter was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience related to Hurricane Ike and the 2007 California wildfires, partially offset by a write down of net recoverables due to the restructuring of the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association Beach Plan.
 
Personal Insurance net written premiums of $1.859 billion increased 1 percent from the prior year quarter.  This result was primarily due to continued positive renewal premium changes and strong retention rates.
 
Agency Automobile and Agency Homeowners and Other as discussed below represent business sold through agents, brokers and other intermediaries, and exclude direct to consumer.
 
Agency Automobile
 
     
Net written premiums of $898 million and policies in force each declined 3 percent from the prior year quarter.
     
Retention rates were strong and renewal premium changes remained positive, both generally consistent with recent quarters.
     
New business declined from the prior year quarter.
 
Agency Homeowners and Other
 
     
Net written premiums of $946 million increased 5 percent, and policies in force increased 3 percent, from the prior year quarter.
     
Retention rates were strong and renewal premium changes remained positive, both generally consistent with recent quarters.
     
New business volume increased from the prior year quarter.
 
The current and prior year periods included the following:
 
The current period underwriting gain reflects a GAAP combined ratio of 93.6 percent, excluding net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, as compared to 92.5 percent in the prior year quarter.  This increase of 1.1 points primarily resulted from reduced underwriting margins related to pricing and loss cost trends and higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by a reduction in the estimate of Texas Windstorm Insurance Association assessments related to Hurricane Ike.
 
Travelers expects that its full year 2009 operating income per diluted share will be in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, as compared to the previously announced range of $4.80 to $5.05.  This guidance includes the reported results for the first nine months of 2009 and estimates for the remainder of 2009 based on a number of assumptions, including:
 
     
Catastrophe losses of $570 million pre-tax and $370 million after-tax, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the full year which incorporates actual experience for the first nine months of 2009 and $129 million pre-tax and $83 million after-tax, or $0.15 per diluted share for the remainder of the year;
     
No additional prior year reserve development, favorable or unfavorable;
     
No significant changes in short-term interest rates or private equity and hedge fund valuations due to an assumption of unchanged market conditions.  Lower real estate partnership valuations due to a continuing downward trend in commercial real estate values;
     
No significant change in average invested assets (excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses), after taking into account dividends and share repurchases;
 
     
Approximately $3.3 billion of share repurchases for the full year ($1.5 billion for the remainder of the year); and
     
Weighted average diluted shares of approximately 570 million.
 
As noted above, the company's earnings guidance for the full year reflects actual prior year reserve development through the third quarter, but does not assume any additional prior year reserve development, favorable or unfavorable.  The company understands that the earnings estimates published by third parties may include assumed amounts of prior year reserve development for future periods. As a result, third party earnings estimates for the company may not be expressed on a basis comparable to the earnings guidance provided by the company.

Glossary of Financial Measures
 
The following measures are used by the company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the company's financial performance.
 
Operating income (loss)
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses).  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss) per share
 
Return on equity
is the ratio of net income to average equity.  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax.
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
Underwriting gain (loss)
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and man-made events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics, and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. Their effects are included in net and operating income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
Loss reserve development
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to one or more prior years or the current year.  In the opinion of the company's management, discussion of loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current year development on incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses, net and operating income, and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 
GAAP combined ratio
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net earned premiums.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100 percent generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
 
GAAP combined ratio excluding incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative
is the GAAP combined ratio adjusted to exclude the direct, variable impact of the company's direct-to-consumer initiative in Personal Insurance.  In the opinion of the company's management, this is useful in an analysis of the profitability of the company's ongoing agency business.
 
Gross written premiums
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume. reflect gross written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers.
Net written premiums
 
Book value per share
is total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.  is total common shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses (i.e., excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses), divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets (i.e., net unrealized investment gains (losses), net
Adjusted book value per share
 
of tax), which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. is adjusted book value per share excluding the after-tax value of goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the company's management, tangible book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value on a nominal basis as it removes certain effects of purchase accounting (i.e., goodwill and other intangible assets), in addition to the effect of changing prices on invested assets.
Tangible book value per share
 
Debt to capital
is the ratio of debt to the sum of shareholders' equity and debt excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses.  In the opinion of the company's management, the debt to capital ratio is useful in an analysis of the company's leverage.
 
Travelers has organized its businesses into the following reportable business segments:
 
Business Insurance
: The Business Insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients primarily in the United States.

Financial, Professional & International Insurance
: The Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment includes surety and financial liability coverages, which require a primarily credit-based underwriting process, as well as property and casualty products that are primarily marketed on a domestic basis in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada, and on an international basis through Lloyd's.  The businesses in Financial, Professional & International Insurance are Bond & Financial Products and International.

Forward Looking Statement
 
This press release contains, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, earnings guidance, statements about our share repurchase plans (which repurchase plans depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors), statements about the potential impact of the recent disruption in the investment markets and other economic conditions on our investment portfolio and underwriting results are forward looking, and we may make forward-looking statements about our results of operations (including, among others, premium volume, net and operating income, investment income, return on equity, expected current returns and combined ratio) and financial condition (including, among others, invested assets and liquidity); the sufficiency of our asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage; catastrophe losses; investment performance; investment, economic and underwriting market conditions; and strategic initiatives.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
 
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our business; financial disruption or a prolonged economic downturn may materially and adversely affect our business; our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material losses; we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, and
 
reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all; we are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business operations; if actual claims exceed our loss reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of loss reserves are necessary, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected; our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances; the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain; the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability; increased competition based on price (resulting, for example, from increased price sensitivity of customers due to the economic downturn or from increased use of price comparison rating technologies by personal auto agents) could lead to reduced revenues and reduced margins; the insurance industry and we are the subject of a number of investigations by state and federal authorities in the United States, and we cannot predict the outcome of these investigations or the impact on our business practices or financial results; our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth; a downgrade in our claims-paying and debt ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our borrowing costs; the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations and to pay future shareholder dividends; disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us; loss of or significant restriction on the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal Insurance products could reduce our future profitability; we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the United States; we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective; our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology; some strategic initiatives, including our direct to consumer initiative in Personal Insurance, are long-term in nature and may negatively impact our loss and loss adjustment expense ratios and underwriting expense ratios as we invest, and these initiatives may not be successful; if we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences.

The Company's top five reinsurer groups, including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors.  Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at September 30, 2009, after deducting mandatory pool and structured settlement balances, $6.4 billion, or 79%, were rated by A.M. Best Company.  Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 98% were rated A- or better.  The remaining 21% net recoverables from reinsurers were comprised of the following:  7% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 9% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 5% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company.  In addition, $2.3 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at September 30, 2009.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
The structured settlements represent recoverables from annuities that were purchased from life insurance companies to settle personal physical injury claims, with workers' compensation claims comprising a significant proportion.  In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the Company retains the liability to the claimant in the event that the life insurance company fails to pay; accordingly, the Company continues to report the amount due from the life insurance company as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes. The Company's top five groups by structured settlement is as follows:

The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated statement of income or required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, and in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.
 
Operating income (loss)
is net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses).  is operating income (loss) on a per share basis.
Operating income (loss) per share
 
Return on equity
is the ratio of net income to average equity  is the ratio of operating income to average equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax. 
.
Operating return on equity
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity are meaningful indicators of underwriting and operating results.  These measures exclude net realized investment gains or losses which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Internally, the Company's management uses operating income, operating income per share and operating return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
Underwriting gain (loss)
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. 
 
A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and man-made events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics, and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount.  Their effects are included in net and operating income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence.  A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.  In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings.
catastrophe
 
Loss reserve development
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.  Loss reserve development may be related to one or more prior years or the current year.  In the opinion of the Company's management, discussion of loss reserve development is useful to investors as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current year development on incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses, net and operating income, and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 
GAAP combined ratio
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio), the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net earned premiums.  For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums.  The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
 
GAAP combined ratio excluding incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative
is the GAAP combined ratio adjusted to exclude the direct, variable impact of the company's direct-to-consumer initiative in Personal Insurance.  In the opinion of the company's management, this is useful in an analysis of the profitability of the company's ongoing agency business.
 
Gross written premiums
reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.  Gross written premiums are a measure of overall business volume.  reflect gross written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers.
Net written premiums
 
Book value per share
is total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.  is total common shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses, divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company's management, adjusted book value is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company's book value as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets, (i.e., net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax) which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Adjusted book value per share
 
Debt to capital
is the ratio of debt to the sum of shareholders' equity and debt excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses.  In the opinion of the company's management, the debt to capital ratio is useful in an analysis of the company's leverage.
