NEWS RELEASE
 
NEW YORK, Nov. 4, 2010 
The Travelers Companies, Inc. ("Travelers," NYSE: TRV) announced today that it has amended and extended its pending solicitation of consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from holders of its 6.75% Senior Notes due 2036 (the "Covered Debt").  The purpose of the Consent Solicitation is to terminate a replacement capital covenant with respect to its 6.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (the "Subordinated Debentures").
 
The amendments to the Consent Solicitation have increased the consent payment from $5.00 to $10.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of Covered Debt as to which a duly executed consent is delivered prior to the expiration of the Consent Solicitation if the Consent Solicitation is successful and the replacement capital covenant is terminated.  The expiration of the Consent Solicitation has been extended to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 5, 2010, unless earlier terminated or further extended by Travelers in its sole discretion.
 
For a complete statement of the terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation, holders of the Covered Debt should refer to the Consent Solicitation Statement dated October 27, 2010. Holders who have previously delivered consents need not take any further action in order to receive the amended consent payment if the Consent Solicitation is successful and the replacement capital covenant is terminated.
 
Copies of the Consent Solicitation Statement and the Letter of Consent may be obtained by holders from the Information Agent, Global Bondholder Services Corporation, at (866) 857-2200.
