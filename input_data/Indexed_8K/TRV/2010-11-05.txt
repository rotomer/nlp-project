NEWS RELEASE
NEW YORK, Nov. 5, 2010 
The Travelers Companies, Inc. ("Travelers," NYSE: TRV) announced today that it has amended and extended its pending solicitation of consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from holders of its 6.75% Senior Notes due 2036 (the "Covered Debt").  The purpose of the Consent Solicitation is to terminate a replacement capital covenant with respect to its 6.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (the "Subordinated Debentures"). The Consent Solicitation was previously amended and extended on November 4, 2010.  Travelers also announced that, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 5, 2010 (the "Consent Date"), it has received consents from a majority of the Holders of the Covered Debt to terminate the replacement capital covenant.
 
The amendments to the Consent Solicitation have revised the timing of the consent payment.  Holders of Covered Debt as to which a consent was validly delivered and not validly withdrawn before the Consent Date will receive the consent payment with respect to such consents on November 8, 2010 (the "Initial Payment Date").  Travelers will execute a termination of the replacement capital covenant and terminate the replacement capital covenant at the Initial Payment Date.  Holders of Covered Debt as to which a consent is validly delivered following the Consent Date but before the expiration of the Consent Solicitation will receive the consent payment with respect to such consents promptly following the expiration of the Consent Solicitation.  The expiration of the Consent Solicitation has been extended to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 12, 2010, unless further extended by Travelers in its sole discretion.
 
Travelers also announced today that it has extended its pending offer to purchase for cash (the "Tender Offer") any and all of its $1.0 billion in outstanding Subordinated Debentures. The expiration of the Tender Offer has been extended to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 8, 2010, unless earlier terminated or further extended by Travelers in its sole discretion. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 5, 2010, approximately $660,933,000 in aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Debentures had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer.
 
For a complete statement of the terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation, holders of the Covered Debt should refer to the Consent Solicitation Statement dated October 27, 2010, as well as the earlier amendment to the Consent Solicitation announced November 4, 2010.
