This Current Report on Form 8-K/A ("Amendment") is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by The Travelers Companies, Inc. (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2011 (the "Original 8-K").  The Original 8-K reported the results of matters voted upon at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 26, 2011 (the "Annual Meeting").  This Amendment is being filed solely to disclose the determination of the Company's Board of Directors regarding how frequently the Company will hold future non-binding, advisory votes on executive compensation.
 
Item 5.07  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
(d)  As reported in the Original 8-K, a majority of the Company's shares represented at the Annual Meeting, in a non-binding, advisory vote, favored an annual vote on executive compensation.  Accordingly, after consideration of these voting results and other factors, the Board of Directors has determined that the Company will hold future non-binding, advisory votes of shareholders to approve the compensation of the named executive officers on an annual basis until the next non-binding shareholder vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on executive compensation, or until the Board of Directors otherwise determines a different frequency for such non-binding votes.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
