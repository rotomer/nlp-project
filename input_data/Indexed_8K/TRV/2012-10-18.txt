Underlying underwriting margin improvement continued across all segments, and net investment income remained strong due to alternative investment performance.
 
            
Written rate gains were strong across all segments.
 
            
Book value per share of $67.81, up 11% from end of prior year quarter and 9% from year-end 2011.

New York, October 18, 2012
 The Travelers Companies, Inc. today reported net income of $864 million, or $2.21 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, compared to $333 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Operating income in the current quarter was $867 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, compared to $332 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. The increase in net and operating income in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting results. Catastrophe losses in the current quarter were $59 million after tax ($91 million pre tax), compared to $394 million after tax ($606 million pre tax) in the prior year quarter.
 
 
 
See Glossary of Financial Measures for definitions and the statistical supplement for additional financial data.
"We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter," commented Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our underwriting performance reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 90.3%, which benefited from lower weather-related losses as well as the rate gains we have achieved during the past year. Net investment income benefited from strong results in our non-fixed income portfolio.
"We are also very pleased with our continued execution in the marketplace, noting in particular that we once again achieved written rate gains across each of our segments. In Business Insurance, we continue to leverage our data and analytics to achieve targeted rate gains in order to drive profitability.  Our results this quarter demonstrate our success in this strategy as our underlying combined ratio improved meaningfully.  In Financial, Professional and International Insurance, renewal rate change improvements from recent quarters were driven by Management Liability, which reported rate gains of more than 6 percent.  In Personal Insurance, we again achieved strong increases in renewal premium change, which includes rate as well as changes in exposure, across the segment, as well as targeted changes in terms and conditions within Agency Homeowners & Other.
 
"We remain committed to continuing to improve profitability through a strategy of actively, but selectively, seeking price increases and improved terms and conditions, given historically low interest rates and uncertain weather patterns," concluded Fishman.
 
Operating income of $867 million after tax increased $535 million from the prior year quarter mostly due to a $512 million after-tax improvement in the underwriting results, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins.
 
The underwriting gain in the current quarter reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 90.3 percent, as compared to 104.5 percent in the prior year quarter. This improvement of 14.2 points in the combined ratio was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses (9.2 points) and higher underlying underwriting margins (4.9 points). Catastrophe losses in the current quarter were primarily driven by increases in estimated losses related to wind and hail storms that occurred in the second quarter 2012. Also included in the current quarter underwriting gain was net favorable prior year reserve development in all three segments.
 
The current quarter underlying underwriting gain, which excludes net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 92.1 percent, as compared to 97.0 percent in the prior year quarter.  This improvement of 4.9 points primarily resulted from lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses as well as earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends.
 
Total revenues of $6.512 billion in the current quarter increased $105 million or 2 percent from the prior year quarter. Within total revenues, earned premiums and net investment income increased $61 million and $32 million, respectively. The modest increase in net investment income was due to the non-fixed income portfolio driven by real estate partnerships and hedge fund performance. Net investment income in the fixed income portfolio decreased slightly from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower reinvestment rates.
Net written premiums of $5.697 billion in the current quarter were approximately the same as the prior year quarter. Renewal rate gains continued across all segments.  Retention rates remained strong across each segment and were generally consistent with recent quarters. New business volumes were lower than the prior year quarter in all segments, largely as a result of the company's pricing strategy. Net written premiums in Business Insurance also benefited from continued positive exposure change at renewal, as well as a meaningfully higher level of positive audit premiums compared to the prior year quarter.
 
"Our $1.5 billion of cash flows from operating activities during the quarter were the highest level since the third quarter of 2007," commented Jay S. Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. "We repurchased 5.4 million shares for $350 million and dividends were $179 million, bringing the year-to-date total capital returned to shareholders to over $1.5 billion."
 
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, shareholders' equity was $25.905 billion, a 6 percent increase from the end of the prior year. Included in shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter of 2012 were after-tax net unrealized investment gains of $3.315 billion, compared to $2.871 billion at year-end 2011. Statutory surplus was $20.291 billion, up $1.117 billion from the beginning of the year. The company's debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) was 21.9 percent, well within its target range, and holding company liquidity was $2.042 billion.
 
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per common share. This dividend is payable December 31, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 10, 2012.
 
"In Business Insurance, our strong results this quarter were driven in large part by lower weather-related losses and previously achieved rate gains," commented Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. "We continued to achieve broad based written rate increases across the segment, led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto, along with improved retentions. We are encouraged by our progress so far and plan on continuing this strategy."
 
Operating income of $543 million after tax increased $249 million from the prior year quarter mostly due to a $227 million after-tax improvement in the underwriting results, reflecting higher underlying underwriting margins and lower catastrophe losses.
 
The underwriting gain in the current quarter reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 93.3 percent, as compared to 105.4 percent in the prior year quarter. This improvement of 12.1 points in the combined ratio was primarily due to higher underlying underwriting margins (6.5 points) and lower catastrophe losses (5.1 points). Also included in the current quarter underwriting gain was net favorable prior year reserve development which primarily resulted from better than
 
expected loss experience in property-related coverages largely for accident years 2009-2011 and in the general liability product line for accident years 2003-2009. These improvements were partially offset by a $108 million after tax ($167 million pre tax) increase to asbestos reserves, which was consistent with the prior year quarter.
The asbestos reserve strengthening in the current quarter was primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate for projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders and higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from recent payment trends being moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment. Notwithstanding these payment trends, the company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
 
The current quarter underlying underwriting gain, which excludes net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 93.0 percent, as compared to 99.5 percent in the prior year quarter. This improvement of 6.5 points primarily resulted from earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends and lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses.
 
Business Insurance net written premiums of $2.962 billion in the current quarter increased 5 percent from the prior year quarter primarily driven by continued increases in renewal rate change. Retention rates remained strong and increased from recent quarters. New business volumes were lower than the prior year quarter, consistent with the company's pricing strategy. Net written premiums also benefited from continued positive exposure change at renewal, as well as a meaningfully higher level of positive audit premiums compared to the prior year quarter.
 
Select Accounts
 
            
Net written premiums of $679 million increased 2 percent from the prior year quarter due to increased renewal premium change as well as a higher level of audit premiums.
            
Renewal premium change was positive, continuing a long-standing trend.
            
Retention rates increased from recent quarters but were lower than the prior year quarter.
            
New business volumes decreased from the prior year quarter.
 
Commercial Accounts
 
            
Net written premiums of $805 million increased 8 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to increased renewal premium change as well as a higher level of positive audit premiums.
            
Renewal premium change was again positive and increased from recent quarters.
            
Retention rates remained strong and increased from recent quarters.
            
New business volumes decreased from the prior year quarter, but were generally consistent with recent quarters.
 
Other Business Insurance
 
Includes Industry-Focused Underwriting, Target Risk Underwriting and Specialized Distribution
 
            
Net written premiums of $1.275 billion increased 3 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to increased renewal premium change as well as a higher level of positive audit premiums.
            
Renewal premium change was positive and continued to increase from recent quarters.
            
Retention rates remained strong and increased from recent quarters.
            
New business volumes decreased from the prior year quarter.
 
National Accounts
 
           
Net written premiums of $202 million increased 15 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to increased renewal premium change driven by payroll exposure growth as well as higher new business volumes. In addition, the repopulation of workers' compensation residual market pools contributed to premium growth in the third quarter 2012.
"In Financial, Professional and International Insurance, we are pleased that our underlying combined ratio has improved both sequentially and year over year in each of the last four quarters driven by improved underwriting results in both our International and Management Liability businesses," commented MacLean.  "We are also pleased that thanks to solid execution in our Management Liability business written rate increases have accelerated both during the quarter and over the past several quarters."
 
 
Operating income of $180 million after tax decreased $31 million from the prior year quarter mostly due to a $29 million after-tax decrease in the underwriting gain, reflecting lower net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher underlying underwriting margins.
 
The underwriting gain in the current quarter reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 80.2 percent, as compared to 76.2 percent in the prior year quarter. This increase of 4.0 points in the combined ratio was due to lower net favorable prior year reserve development (7.8 points), partially offset by higher underlying underwriting margins (3.5 points). Net favorable prior year reserve development in the current quarter primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in the surety business within Bond & Financial Products for accident years 2006-2007 as well as in several lines of business within International, partially offset by a $6 million after tax ($8 million pre tax) increase to asbestos reserves.
 
The current quarter underlying underwriting gain, which excludes net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 91.4 percent, as compared to 94.9 percent in the prior year quarter. This improvement of 3.5 points primarily resulted from a lower level of large losses within International as well as earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends, partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio primarily as a result of lower earned premiums.
Financial, Professional & International Insurance net written premiums of $729 million decreased 10 percent from the prior year quarter primarily driven by International due to a number of factors described below.
 
Retention rates, renewal premium changes and new business volumes, as discussed below, exclude the surety line of business as surety products are generally sold on a non-recurring, project-specific basis.
 
Bond & Financial Products
 
            
Net written premiums of $529 million decreased 2 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower business volumes in construction surety reflecting the continued slowdown in construction spending, partially offset by growth in Management Liability business volume.
            
Renewal premium change remained positive and continued to increase from recent quarters due to positive renewal rate change, partially offset by slightly lower insured exposures.
            
Retention rates remained strong and generally consistent with recent quarters.
            
New business volumes decreased from the prior year quarter.
 
International
 
            
Net written premiums of $200 million decreased 26 percent from the prior year quarter primarily driven by policies written in the third quarter of 2011 that, because their terms were generally 18 months, were not up for renewal in the third quarter of 2012, lower surety volumes in Canada and the impact of the company's withdrawal from the personal insurance business in Ireland.
            
Renewal premium change was slightly negative as the impact of continued positive renewal rate change was offset by lower insured exposures.
            
Retention rates decreased from recent quarters but were improved from the prior year quarter.
            
New business volumes decreased from the prior year quarter.
 
"In Personal Insurance, our improved underwriting performance this quarter resulted from lower weather-related losses," commented MacLean. "Given our goal of improving profitability over time, we are particularly pleased with the significant acceleration of pricing gains that we achieved this quarter in both Auto and Homeowners. Although this strategy has resulted in lower new business volumes, retention rates remain high and we will continue to seek improved pricing, terms and conditions."
 
Operating income of $206 million after tax increased $314 million from the prior year quarter due to improved underwriting results, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and higher net favorable prior year reserve development.
 
The underwriting gain in the current quarter reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 89.7 percent, as compared to 115.0 percent in the prior year quarter. This improvement of 25.3 points in the combined ratio was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses (19.2 points) and higher net favorable prior year reserve development (3.1 points). The net favorable prior year reserve development in the current quarter primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Homeowners & Other attributable to weather-related losses incurred in 2011 and in the umbrella product line for accident years 2007-2010.
 
The current quarter underlying underwriting gain, which excludes net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 91.0 percent, as compared to 94.0 percent in the prior year quarter. This improvement of 3.0 points was primarily due to lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses.
 
Personal Insurance net written premiums of $2.006 billion decreased 2 percent from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower new business volumes in Automobile.
Agency Automobile and Agency Homeowners & Other, as discussed below, represent business sold through agents, brokers and other intermediaries and exclude direct to consumer.

Net written premiums of $906 million decreased 4 percent from the prior year quarter.

Renewal premium change remained positive and increased meaningfully from recent quarters.

Operating income of $2.163 billion after tax increased $1.382 billion from the prior year period due to a $1.388 billion after-tax increase in underwriting results, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins.
 
The underwriting gain in the current period reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 94.3 percent, as compared to 108.2 percent in the prior year period. This improvement of 13.9 points in the combined ratio was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses (10.0 points) and higher underlying underwriting margins (3.1 points).
 
The current period underlying underwriting gain, which excludes net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses, reflected a GAAP combined ratio of 93.7 percent, as compared to 96.8 percent in the prior year period. This improvement of 3.1 points primarily resulted from lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses as well as earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends.

The company cautions investors that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
 
Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
                 
catastrophe
losses could materially and adversely affect the company's results of operations, its financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact the company's ratings, the company's ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance;
                 
during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, the company's business could be materially and adversely affected;
                
if actual claims exceed the company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, the company's financial results could be materially and adversely affected;
                 
the company's investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses;
                 
the company's business could be harmed because of its potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation;
                 
the company is exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances;
                 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the company's business are uncertain;
                 
the intense competition that the company faces could harm its ability to maintain or increase its business volumes, its pricing levels and/or its profitability;
                 
the company may not be able to collect all amounts due to it from reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to the company in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all;
                 
the company is exposed to credit risk in certain of its business operations;
                 
within the United States, the company's businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which it conducts business, including licensing and supervision, and changes in regulation may reduce the company's profitability and limit its growth;
                 
changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on the company and otherwise adversely impact its results;
                 
a downgrade in the company's claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact the company's business volumes, adversely impact the company's ability to access the capital markets and increase the company's borrowing costs;
                 
the inability of the company's insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the company's holding company in sufficient amounts would harm the company's ability to meet its obligations, pay future shareholder dividends or make future share repurchases;
                 
disruptions to the company's relationships with its independent agents and brokers could adversely affect the company;
                 
the company's efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks;
                 
any net deferred tax asset could be adversely affected by a reduction in the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate;
                 
the company may be adversely affected if its pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results;
                 
the company is subject to a number of risks associated with its business outside the United States;
                 
new regulations outside of the U.S., including in the European Union, could adversely impact the company's results of operations and limit its growth;
                 
the company's business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology;
                 
if the company experiences difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, the company's ability to conduct its business could be negatively impacted;
                 
acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences;
                 
changes to existing accounting standards may adversely impact the company's reported results;
                 
the company could be adversely affected if its controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective;
                 
the company's businesses may be adversely affected if it is unable to hire and retain qualified employees;
                 
loss of or significant restriction on the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal Insurance products could reduce the company's future profitability; and
                 
the company's repurchase plans depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, common share price, catastrophe losses, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions), market conditions and other factors.
 
Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
The following measures are used by the company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated financial statements or are not required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements or, in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures also follow.
 
In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and other financial statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the company's financial performance.  Internally, the company's management uses these measures to evaluate performance against historical results, to establish financial targets on a consolidated basis and for other reasons, which are discussed below.
 
Some of these measures exclude net realized investment gains (losses), net of tax, and/or net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.
 
Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the company's management.
 
RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-GAAP MEASURES TO NET INCOME
 
Operating income

RECONCILIATION OF PRE-TAX UNDERWRITING GAIN EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS TO NET INCOME
 
Underwriting gain (loss)
is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. In the opinion of the company's management, it is important to measure the profitability of each segment excluding the results of investing activities, which are managed separately from the insurance business. This measure is used to assess each segment's business performance and as a tool in making business decisions.  , is the underwriting gain (loss) adjusted to exclude claims, claim adjustment expenses, and reinstatement premiums and assessments related to catastrophes and loss reserve development related to time periods prior to the current year. In the opinion of the company's management, this measure is meaningful to users of the financial statements to understand the company's periodic earnings and the variability of earnings caused by the unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and loss reserve development.

A is a severe loss, resulting from natural and man-made events, including risks such as fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics, and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. Their effects are included in net and operating income (loss) and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion

of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful to users of the financial statements to understand the company's periodic earnings and the variability in periodic earnings caused by the unpredictable nature of catastrophes.
 
Net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development
is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims, which may be related to one or more prior years. In the opinion of the company's management, a discussion of loss reserve development is meaningful to users of the financial statements as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current year development on incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses, net and operating income (loss), and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.
 
Reconciliation of Pre-tax Underwriting Gain (Excluding the Impact of Catastrophes and Net Favorable Prior Year Loss Reserve Development) to Net Income
ADJUSTMENT TO THE GAAP COMBINED RATIO FOR THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE
 
GAAP combined ratio
is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (loss and LAE ratio) and the underwriting expense ratio. For GAAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reduced by an allocation of fee income to net earned premiums. The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income, and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums. A GAAP combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit.  A GAAP combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. The GAAP combined ratio is an operating statistic that includes GAAP measures in the numerator and the denominator.
Calculation of the GAAP Combined Ratio
 
 
(1)  For purposes of computing GAAP ratios, billing and policy fees (which are a component of other revenues) are allocated as a reduction of underwriting expenses.  In addition, fee income is allocated as a reduction of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses.
GAAP combined ratio excluding the incremental impact of the direct to consumer initiative
is the GAAP combined ratio adjusted to exclude the direct, variable impact of the company's direct-to-consumer initiative in Personal Insurance. In the opinion of the company's management, this is useful in an analysis of the profitability of the company's ongoing agency business.

The Company entered into these arrangements as part of its strategy to shorten the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio.  In a changing interest rate environment, the change in the value of the futures contracts can be expected to partially offset changes in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio.
 
 
 
The Company's top five reinsurer groups, including retroactive reinsurance, by reinsurance recoverable is as follows:
 
 
The gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the current and estimated future amounts due from reinsurers on known and unasserted claims.  The ceded reserves are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying direct and assumed reserves.  Although this total comprises recoverables due from nearly one thousand different reinsurance entities, about half is attributable to 10 reinsurer groups.
 
The net reinsurance recoverables reflect an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, reinsurer solvency, the Company's experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors.  Of the total net recoverables due from reinsurers at September 30, 2012, after deducting mandatory pools and associations and structured settlement balances, $4.1 billion, or 80%, were rated by A.M. Best Company.  Of the total rated by A.M. Best Company, 98% were rated A- or better.  The remaining 20% net recoverables from reinsurers were comprised of the following:  6% related to the Company's participation in voluntary pools, 11% related to recoverables from captive insurance companies and 3% were balances from other companies not rated by A.M. Best Company.  In addition, $1.6 billion of the net recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, funds held and trust agreements at September 30, 2012.
 
The mandatory pools and associations represent various involuntary assigned risk pools that the Company is required to participate in.  These pools principally involve workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance coverages to insureds that otherwise are unable to purchase coverage in the open market.  The costs of these mandatory pools in most states are usually charged back to the participating members in proportion to voluntary writings of related business in that state.  In the event that a member of the pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the pool's liabilities.
 
Included in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements, which comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion.  In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a liability and as a reinsurance recoverable, as the Company retains the contingent liability to pay the claimant in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments.  The Company would be required to make such payments, to the extent the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations.
 
The Company's top five groups by structured settlement is as follows:

The following measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis.  In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated financial statements or are not required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements or, in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure.
 
In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures provides investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and other financial statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance.  Internally, the Company's management uses these measures to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis.
 
Some of these measures exclude net realized gains (losses), net of tax, and/or net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.
 
Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company's management.
