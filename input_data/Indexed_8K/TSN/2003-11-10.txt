Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 10, 2003, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2003.  The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Company's conference call relating to the press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures.  A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements. 
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of litigation settlements, the closing or restructuring of selected operations, impairment charges for investments, and other similar events.  The Company's management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations.  Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Limitation on Incorporation by Reference
In accordance with general instructions B.2 and B.6 of Form 8-K, the information in this report, including exhibits, is furnished pursuant to Items 9 and 12 and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

John Tyson, chairman and CEO, said, "We continue to make adjustments to our business to better position us for the future.  I am pleased with the progress we've made.  We achieved our synergy target and reduced our debt-to-capital ratio to just below 48%, well below our target of 50%.  We completed the organizational alignment required to expand our customer account team strategy  - offering a single point of contact, delivering all of Tyson Foods' products and support.  We invested over $100 million to support our branding efforts and promote the Tyson brand for chicken, beef and pork.
"In fiscal 2003 we embarked on an aggressive goal to increase the percentage of sales from value-added products from 35 percent to 50 percent within five years," Tyson added.  "During the year we successfully introduced and gained share in new products across all channels, including Tyson branded consumer products in the raw and fully-cooked bacon, self-serve deli meats, luncheon meats, dinner meats, canned broths and bullions categories." 
At this time, the Company expects fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.90 to $1.20.

Fourth Quarter Segment Review (In millions)
 
Beef segment fourth quarter sales increased $641 million or 24.2% from the same period last year, with a 22.5% increase in average sales prices and a 1.4% increase in volume.  Case-ready beef sales were $263 million and increased 33.3%, domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 22.1% and international beef sales increased 29.1%.  Beef segment operating income increased $95 million.  The beef segment sales and operating income increases were primarily due to the combination of strong demand against decreased supplies of domestic beef caused in part by the U.S. ban on Canadian beef.  However, these increases were partially offset by an increase in live cattle prices.
Chicken segment fourth quarter sales increased $133 million or 7.4% from the same period last year, with a 2.3% increase in average sales prices and a 5.0% increase in volume.  Foodservice chicken sales dollars increased 4.1%, retail chicken sales dollars increased 7.1%, and international chicken sales increased 16.4%.  Chicken segment operating income decreased $18 million from the same period last year primarily due to increased grain costs and plant closing costs.
Pork segment fourth quarter sales increased $83 million or 14.5% from the same period last year, with a 19.6% increase in average sales prices and a 4.2% decrease in volume.  Case-ready pork sales were $63 million and increased 58.3%, domestic fresh meat pork sales increased 10.7%, international pork sales increased 54.1% and live swine sales decreased 58.7%.  Pork segment operating income increased $42 million.  Excluding the fourth quarter 2002 live swine restructuring charge of $26 million, operating income increased $16 million.  The increase was due to higher average sales prices and improved case-ready performance, partially offset by an increase in live hog prices.  Also, operating income was positively affected by the prior year restructuring of the live swine operation.
Prepared foods segment fourth quarter sales decreased $36 million or 4.9% from the same period last year with a 3.2% decrease in average sales prices and a 1.7% decrease in volume.  Excluding prior year Specialty Brands sales of $65 million, segment sales increased $29 million and volume increased 7.3%.  Segment operating income decreased $28 million from the same period last year. Excluding the prior year Thomas E. Wilson brand write-down of $27 million, operating income declined $55 million.  This decline resulted primarily from the current period increases in raw material prices, lower average selling prices, increased costs related to the introduction of several new products and the strike at the Jefferson facility.

News Release
Twelve Months Segment Review (In millions)
 
Beef segment 12 months sales increased $1.4 billion or 13.8% from the same period last year, with a 13.2% increase in average sales prices and a slight increase in volume.  Case-ready beef sales were $957 million and increased 20.4%, domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 11.8% and international beef sales increased 19.4%.  Beef segment operating income increased $100 million.  The beef segment sales and operating income increases were caused by strong demand during the second half of fiscal 2003.  However these increases were partially offset by an increase in live cattle prices.
Chicken segment 12 months sales increased $205 million or 2.8% from the same period last year, with a slight decrease in average sales prices and a 3.3% increase in volume.  Foodservice chicken sales dollars increased 4.2%, retail chicken sales dollars increased 2.3% and international chicken sales dollars decreased 3.6%.  Chicken segment operating income decreased $270 million from the same period last year primarily due to increased grain costs and plant closing costs.
Pork segment 12 months sales decreased $33 million or 1.3% from the same period last year, with a 2.9% increase in average sales prices and a 4.1% decrease in volume.  Case-ready pork sales were $221 million and increased 52.3%, domestic fresh meat pork sales decreased 3.5%, international pork sales increased 2.8% and live swine sales decreased 42.6%.  Pork segment operating income increased $50 million.  Excluding the fourth quarter 2002 live swine restructuring charge of $26 million, operating income increased $24 million.  The decline in sales is primarily due to declines in live swine sales and lower average selling prices for our finished product.  Operating income was positively affected by the prior year restructuring of the live swine operation, partially offset by higher live hog prices.
Prepared foods 12 months sales decreased $410 million or 13.4% from the same period last year, with a 5.9% decrease in average sales prices and an 8.0% decrease in volume.  Excluding prior year Specialty Brands sales of $244 million, segment sales declined $166 million and volume slightly.  Segment operating income decreased $101 million from the same period last year.  Excluding the prior year Thomas E. Wilson brand write-down of $27 million, operating income declined $128 million.  This decline results primarily from the increases during the year in raw material prices, lower average selling prices, increased costs related to the introduction of several new products this year and temporary operating inefficiencies at certain plants.
Other segment operating income increased $171 million primarily due to settlements received in connection with the vitamin antitrust litigation.  Current year results include $167 million as compared to $30 million received in fiscal 2002.
