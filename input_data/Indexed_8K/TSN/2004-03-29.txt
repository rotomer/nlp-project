EXHIBIT 99.1
- Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) (the "Company") today announced that it has received notice of a formal, non-public investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  The SEC is seeking information primarily with respect to the disclosure of perquisites provided to certain directors and officers of the Company (including Don Tyson, former Senior Chairman of the Company, and John Tyson, Chairman and CEO of the Company).  The Company has been cooperating fully with the SEC and will continue to do so.  The independent members of the Board of Directors have conducted a review of the matter.  Based on this review, the Company does not believe that the amounts involved are material to the Company's financial position or results of operations; however, the Company is presently unable to predict any action that the SEC might take.
