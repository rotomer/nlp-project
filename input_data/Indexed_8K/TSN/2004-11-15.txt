Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On November 15, 2004, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the fourth quarter ending October 2, 2004.  The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Companys conference call relating to the press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a companys financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Companys financial statements. 
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, BSE-related charges, fixed asset write-downs, impairment charges related to various intangible assets, litigation settlements and other similar events.  The Companys management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Companys operations.  Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our cash flow from operations increased by $112 million, or $220 million excluding prior year vitamin settlements received, net of tax.  We improved our ROIC and reduced our debt to capital to 44%.  Our growth in value-added products has risen to 38% fueled by distribution gains in fully cooked frozen products, bacon, refrigerated ingredient meats and dinner meats, as well as fresh case-ready beef and pork.  In August, we  introduced a new marketing and communications strategy designed to market our full range of chicken, beef and pork products under the Tyson brand with our new slogan, Powered by Tyson.  We made a lot of progress on our stated goals in 2004, but we still have room to improve. 
Our management team has demonstrated their ability to handle the challenges of our business, and we will demonstrate that again in 2005.  Our goals for 2005 are to generate earnings per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.45, reduce our debt to capital to 40%, improve our mix of value-added products to over 40% of sales and target a ROIC of 14%.  Were looking forward to another good year in 2005.

Segment Performance Review (in millions)
 
 
TYSON FOODS, INC. News Release November 15, 2004 Page 3 of 8
Chicken (32.4% of Net Sales, 55.1% of Total Operating Income  4th Quarter 2004)                 (31.8% of Net Sales, 59.2% of Total Operating Income  12 Months 2004)
                - -Improved pricing, product mix and operating efficiencies all led to improved results in the                  chicken segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
Chicken segment sales increased by 20.2% and 13.1% in the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.  Sales and operating income increases for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004 were primarily due to increased average selling prices and sales volumes, as well as improvements in product mix and operating efficiencies. 
Fourth quarter fiscal 2004 operating income increased $48 million excluding fixed asset write-downs of $13 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and plant closing related accruals of $10 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.  Operating income for the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by increased grain costs of $106 million as compared to the same period last year and by approximately $20 million of losses from the Companys on-going commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases. 
Fiscal 2004 operating income increased $340 million excluding plant closing related accruals of $13 million and $76 million recorded in the 12 months of fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, and fixed asset write-downs of $13 million recorded in fiscal 2004.  Operating income was negatively impacted for the 12 months of fiscal 2004 by approximately $239 million of increased grain costs, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $127 million from the Companys on-going commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases.  The increases in the Companys domestic Chicken segment sales volumes for the 12 months of fiscal 2004 were partially offset by decreased international sales volumes due to import restrictions by various countries caused by the avian influenza outbreaks in the United States.
Beef (44.0% of Net Sales, 22.5% of Total Operating Income  4th Quarter 2004)          (45.2% of Net Sales, 13.7% of Total Operating Income  12 Months 2004)           -
Sales in domestic fresh meat and case-ready increased but were offset by higher live cattle costs, lower            capacity utilization and decreases in international sales.
Beef segment sales decreased by 4.1% and increased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.  Fourth quarter sales and operating income were negatively impacted by losses of $29 million, as compared to $12 million of gains recorded in the same period last year, related to open mark-to-market of open futures positions as of October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively, from the Companys on-going commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef sales.  For fiscal 2004, the Companys on-going commodity risk management activities resulted in losses of $1 million as compared to $17 million of gains recorded in the same period last year.  Operating income for the 12 months of fiscal 2004 included BSE related charges of $61 million.  Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $5 million related to the impairment of various intangible assets and fixed asset write-downs, increased live cattle prices, production declines and decreased capacity utilization for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004.  These decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices and increased volumes and margins at our Lakeside operation in Canada.
Pork (12.4% of Net Sales, 12.9% of Total Operating Income 4 Quarter 2004)           (12.0% of Net Sales, 15.1% of Total Operating Income 12 Months 2004)           -
th
Strong demand for pork products both domestically and internationally led to sales and volume increases.
Pork segment sales increased by 37.2% in the fourth quarter and by 28.9% in the 12 months of fiscal 2004, compared to the same periods last year.  The increase in the Pork segments operating income for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased demand as pork benefited from stronger domestic and international markets, more than offsetting increases in live costs.  Operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $1 million related to fixed asset write-downs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
TYSON FOODS, INC. News Release November 15, 2004 Page 4 of 8
Prepared Foods (11.0% of Net Sales, (2.8%) of Total Operating Income  4th Quarter 2004)                              (10.8% of Net Sales, 3.0% of Total Operating Income  12 Months 2004)                              - -
Continued operating success was due to higher selling prices and increased volumes.
Prepared Foods segment sales increased by 12.1% and 7.3%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004, compared to the same periods last year.  Fiscal 2004 operating income increased $25 million excluding plant closing related accruals of $27 million, the impairment of various intangible assets of  $22 million and fixed asset write-downs of $5 million, all of which were recorded in fiscal 2004.  The increase in the Prepared Foods segments operating income for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes, partially offset by increased raw material prices.
Other segment operating income decreased for both the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2004 primarily due to settlements of $3 million and $167 million received in the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2003, respectively, related to vitamin antitrust litigation.
