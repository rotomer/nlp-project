ITEM 1.01 - ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE CONTRACT.
On November 12, 2004, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") entered into employment agreements with Craig J. Hart, the Company's Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, and Dennis Leatherby, the Company's Senior Vice President, Finance and Treasurer and Interim Chief Financial Officer.  On November 15, 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with J. Alberto Gonzalez-Pita, the Company's Executive Vice-President and General Counsel (collectively with Messrs. Hart and Leatherby, the "Officers").   
The term of employment under each employment agreement commences as of an effective date of October 4, 2004 and terminates on October 4, 2009, unless terminated prior to such date.  Mr. Gonzalez-Pita's agreement provides for an annual base salary of not less than $475,000.  The agreements with Messrs. Leatherby and Hart each provide for an annual base salary of not less than $260,000. Each Officer is also eligible to receive awards under the Company's annual bonus plan in effect during their term of employment, subject to the discretion of senior management of the Company.  In addition, the Officers may also participate in financial and welfare benefit programs generally applicable to officers of the Company, including the Company's stock option, restricted stock programs, supplemental executive retirement, life insurance plans and medical reimbursement plans.  The Officers' compensation will be subject to review from time to time when compensation of other officers and managers of the Company are reviewed for consideration of increases. 
Under the agreements, the Officers received restricted stock grants of shares of Class A Common Stock vesting on October 4, 2009 in the following amounts:  Mr. Gonzalez-Pita - 53,571.4286 shares, Mr. Leatherby - 20,676.6917 shares and Mr. Hart - 26,420.2172 shares.  In addition, Mr. Hart received a restricted stock grant of 5,117 shares of Class A Common Stock which vests on December 26, 2005 and Mr. Leatherby received a restricted stock grant of 5,012 shares of Class A Common Stock which vests on October 15, 2006.  Under the agreements, each Officer is entitled to receive on the grant dates specified by the Company, consistent with the Company's past practice, a grant of options to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and pursuant to an option grant agreement currently in use by the Company for officers generally.   The exercise price of any such grant must be equal to the market price on the date of the stock option grant, and the options are part of the consideration received by the officer for his agreement to protections of confidential information and trade secrets of the Company and to a non-competition provision that extends one year after termination of the Officer's employment.  On September 29, 2004, the date selected by the Company for granting options to management employees, Mr. Gonzalez-Pita received a grant of 40,000 options, and Messrs. Leatherby and Hart each received a grant of 8,000 options, as previously reported by these officers on Form 4s.  On future grant dates selected by the Company, Mr. Gonzalez-Pita will receive a grant of 40,000 options and Messrs. Leatherby and Hart each will receive a grant of 8,000 options.  The options vest forty percent (40%) on the second anniversary of the date of the grant and in twenty percent (20%) increments annually thereafter until fully vested.
Mr. Gonzalez-Pita also received a signing bonus in the amount of $600,000 prior to entering into his agreement and a performance award payable in shares of Class A Common Stock having an aggregate value on the date of grant of $375,000.  On the first business day of each of the Company's 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, Mr. Gonzalez-Pita will be eligible to receive an additional performance award payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, with each award having a maximum aggregate value on the date of grant of $375,000.  All performance share awards are subject to  
the approval of shareholders at the Company's 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Subject to shareholder approval, each performance share award will vest three years after the date of grant based upon a comparison of the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock to a peer group of publicly traded companies and the achievement by the Company of certain return on invested capital measures. 
The Officers may terminate their employment under the respective employment agreements, subject to their confidentiality and non-compete obligations, upon ninety days' notice to the Company, and the Company has the right to terminate the agreements at any time upon written notice subject to the obligation to continue to pay base salary for a period specified in each agreement (which in any event does not exceed one year) and subject to provisions relating to the early vesting of stock options and restricted stock upon such termination. 
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the employment agreements, which are attached as exhibits to this Form 8-K.

                        (a)        Officer shall receive, in addition to all regular compensation for services as described in Section 3 of this Agreement, as additional consideration for signing this Agreement and for agreeing to abide and be bound by the terms, provisions and restrictions of this Section 8, the following:
                                    (i)         An award of shares of Tyson Foods, Inc. Class A Common Stock ("Common Stock") subject to the terms and conditions of a restricted stock grant agreement currently in use by the Employer for awards to officers generally.
53571.4286
                                    (ii)        During Officer's Period of Employment, on grant dates to be specified by Employer consistent with Employer's past practices for grants of options to Employees generally, a grant of options to purchase shares of  Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan ("Stock Plan"), and an option grant agreement currently in use by the Employer for officers generally.
40,000
(iii)       On the first business day of each of the Company's 2005, 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, Officer shall receive a performance award payable in shares of Common Stock (referred to herein as "Performance Stock") having a maximum aggregate value of $ on the date of the award, subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and the form of performance award currently in use by the Employer for officers generally.  Subject to the approval of shareholders of the Company (discussed below), and the satisfaction of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable performance award agreement, the award made in 2005 shall vest two (2) business days after the Company publicly releases its earnings for the 2007 fiscal year, the award made in 2006 shall vest two (2) business days after the Company publicly releases its earnings for the 2008 fiscal year, and the award made in 2007 shall vest two
375,000.00
4
(2) business days after the Company publicly releases its earnings for the 2009 fiscal year.  The awarding of Performance Stock by the Company must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the issues at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders duly held in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.   All awards of Performance Stock made by the Compensation Committee prior to such shareholder approval are contingent upon the approval. In the event shareholder approval is not obtained, within the time frame set forth in this Section 8(a)(iii), the award of Performance Stock made pursuant to this Section 8(a)(iii) shall be null and void and of no force and effect. 
                        (b)        Officer recognizes that, as a result of Officer's employment hereunder (and Officer's employment, if any, with Employer for periods prior to the Effective Date), Officer has had and will continue to have access to confidential information in multiple forms, electronic or otherwise, such confidential information including but not being limited to trade secrets, proprietary information, intellectual property, and other documents, data, and information concerning methods, processes, controls, techniques, formulas, production, distribution, purchasing, financial analysis, returns and reports (in addition if Officer is involved with marketing, sales or procurement Officer has had and will continue to have access to lists of customers, suppliers, vendors, and accounts, other sensitive information and data regarding the customers, suppliers, vendors, services, sales, pricing, and costs of Employer which are highly confidential and constitute trade secrets or confidential business information) which is the property of and integral to the operations and success of Employer, and therefore agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 8, which Officer agrees and acknowledges to be reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate and important business interests and concerns of Employer.  Officer acknowledges that the information referred to above has independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.  Officer further acknowledges that Employer has taken all reasonable steps under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy and/or confidentiality of such information.
                        (c)        Officer agrees that Officer will not divulge to any person, nor use to the detriment of Employer, nor use in any business or process of manufacture competitive with or similar to any business or process of manufacture of Employer, at any time during Period of
5
Employment or thereafter, any of the trade secrets and/or other confidential information of the Employer, whether in electronic form or otherwise, without first obtaining the express written permission of Employer. A trade secret shall include any information maintained as confidential and used by Employer in its business, including but not limited to a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that has value, actual or potential, from its confidentiality and from not being readily ascertainable to others who could also obtain value from such information.  For purposes of this Section 8, the compilation of information used by Employer in its business shall include, without limitation, the identity of customers and suppliers and information reflecting their interests, preferences, credit-worthiness, likely receptivity to solicitation for participation in various transactions and related information obtained during the course of Officer's employment with Employer.
                        (d)        Officer agrees that at the time of leaving the employ of Employer, Officer will deliver to Employer, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all originals and copies, electronic or hard copy, of notebooks, memoranda, documents, communications, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the business of Employer, or constituting property of the Employer.  Officer further agrees that Officer will not, directly or indirectly, request or advise any customers or suppliers of Employer to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with Employer.
                        (e)        During Officer's Period of Employment with the Employer and for a period of one (1) year after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer will not directly or indirectly, in the United States, participate in any Position in any business in Direct Competition with the business of the Employer.  The term "Direct Competition," as used in this section, shall mean any business that directly competes against any line of business in which Officer was actively engaged during Officer's employment with the Employer.  The term "Position," as used in this section, includes a partner, director, holder of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares, principal, executive, officer, manager or any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer, where Officer performs any duties which are substantially similar to those performed by the Officer during Officer's employment with Employer.  Officer acknowledges that a "substantially
6
 
similar" position shall include any position in which Officer might be able to utilize the valuable, proprietary and confidential information to which Officer was exposed during Officer's employment with Employer.  It is acknowledged and agreed that the scope of the clause as set forth above is essential, because 1) a more restrictive definition of "Position" (e.g. limiting it to the "same" position with a competitor) will subject the Employer to serious, irreparable harm by allowing competitors to describe positions in ways to evade the operation of this clause, and substantially restrict the protection sought by Employer, and 2) by allowing the Officer to escape the application of this clause by accepting a position designated as a "lesser" or "different" position with a competitor, the Employer is unable to restrict the Officer from providing valuable information to such competing entity to the harm of the Employer.
                        (f)         Officer recognizes that Officer possesses confidential information and trade secrets about other employees of Employer relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, salary and benefits, and interpersonal relationships with customers and suppliers of Employer. Officer recognizes that the information Officer possesses about these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Employer in securing and retaining customers and suppliers, and was acquired by Officer because of Officer's business position with Employer.  Officer agrees that during Officer's Period of Employment hereunder, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive, if applicable, the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee or agent of Employer, with a view to or for the purposes of inducing or encouraging such employee or agent to leave the employ of Employer, for the purpose of being hired by Officer, any employer affiliated with Officer, or any competitor of Employer.  Officer agrees that Officer will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees to anyone affiliated with Officer or to any competitor of Employer.
                        (g)        Officer acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect Employer's interest in this Agreement and that any breach thereof will result in an irreparable injury to Employer for which Employer has no adequate remedy at law.  Officer therefore agrees that, in the event  Officer breaches any of the provisions contained in this Section 8, Employer shall be authorized and entitled to seek from any court of
7
 
competent jurisdiction (i) a temporary restraining order, (ii) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,  (iii) an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such breach, (iv) direct, incidental and consequential damages arising from such breach; and/or(v) all reasonable legal fees and costs related to any actions taken by Employer to enforce Section 8.
                        (h)        Employer and Officer have attempted to specify a reasonable period of time, a reasonable area and reasonable restrictions to which this Section 8 shall apply.  Employer and Officer agree that if a court or administrative body should subsequently determine that the terms of this Section 8 are greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest, Employer agrees to waive those terms which are found by a court or administrative body to be greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest and to request that the court or administrative body reform this Agreement specifying a reasonable period of time and such other reasonable restrictions as the court or administrative body deems necessary.  Further, Officer agrees that Employer shall have the right to amend or modify this Section 8 as necessary to comport with the determination of any court or administrative body that such Section in this or a similar agreement entered into by Employer with any other officer or manager of Employer is greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest.
(i)  Officer further agrees that this Section 8, as well as the Sections 12 and 13 relating to choice of law and forum for resolution, are integral parts of this Agreement, and that should a court fail or refuse to enforce the restrictions contained herein in the manner expressly provided in Sections 8(a) through 8(g) above, the Employer shall recover from Officer, and the court shall award to the Employer, the consideration (or a pro-rata portion thereof to the extent these provisions are enforced but the time frame is reduced beyond that specified above) provided to and elected by Officer under the terms of Section 8(a) above (or the monetary equivalent thereof), its cost and its reasonable attorney's fees.  Officer acknowledges that such award is not intended as "liquidated damages" and is not exclusive to other remedies available to Employer.  Instead such award is intended to ensure that Officer is not unjustly enriched as a result of retaining contract benefits not earned by Officer.
            9.  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including the terms of Section 7 hereof, Employer may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate this Agreement, and Officer's Period of Employment hereunder without any
Termination for Egregious Circumstances
8
 
payment, liability or other obligation, in the event, (a) Officer engages in misconduct which results in injury to the Employer, or (b) Officer is convicted of a job-related felony or misdemeanor.   
            10.  .  This Agreement contains all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties hereto, and no other agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be deemed to exist or bind either of the parties hereto, except for any pre-employment confidentiality agreement that may exist between the parties.  This Agreement  cannot be modified except by a writing signed by both parties.
Modification
            11.    This Agreement shall be binding upon Officer, Officer's heirs, executors and personal representatives and upon Employer, its successors and assigns. Officer may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without first obtaining the written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Employer.
Assignment.
            12.  .  Officer acknowledges that this Agreement is performable at various locations throughout the United States and specifically performable wholly or partly within the State of Delaware and consents to the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement being governed by the internal laws of said State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
Applicable Law
            13.    The courts of Washington County, Arkansas shall have exclusive jurisdiction and be the venue of all disputes between the Employer and Officer, whether such disputes arise from this Agreement or otherwise.  In addition, Officer expressly waives any right Officer may have to sue or be sued in the county of Officer's residence and consents to venue in Washington County, Arkansas.
Jurisdiction and Venue of Disputes.
            14.    Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (defined below) the restricted Common Stock, stock options, and Performance Stock that have been granted to Officer pursuant to an award agreement from the Employer under Sections 8(a)(i),(ii) and (iii), or which have otherwise been previously granted to Officer under an award agreement from the Employer; and which awards are unvested at the time of the Change in Control, will vest sixty (60) days after the Change in Control event occurs (unless vesting earlier pursuant to the terms of an award agreement).  If the Officer is terminated by the Employer other than for egregious circumstances during such sixty (60) day period, all of the unvested restricted

The Committee shall have the sole discretion to interpret the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.

                        (a)        Officer shall receive, in addition to all regular compensation for services as described in Section 3 of this Agreement, as additional consideration for signing this Agreement and for agreeing to abide and be bound by the terms, provisions and restrictions of this Section 8, the following:
                                    (i)         An award of  shares of Tyson Foods, Inc. Class A Common Stock ("Common Stock") subject to the terms and conditions of a restricted stock grant agreement currently in use by the Employer for awards to officers generally.
26,420.2172
                                    (ii)        During Officer's Period of Employment on grant dates to be specified by Employer consistent with Employer's past practices for grants of options to Employees generally, a grant of  options to purchase shares of Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan ("Stock Plan"), and an option grant agreement currently in use by the Employer for officers generally.   
8,000
                        (b)        Officer recognizes that, as a result of Officer's employment hereunder (and Officer's employment, if any, with Employer for periods prior to the Effective Date), Officer has had and will continue to have access to confidential information in multiple forms, electronic or otherwise, such confidential information including but not being limited to trade secrets, proprietary information, intellectual property, and other documents, data, and information concerning methods, processes, controls, techniques, formulas, production, distribution, purchasing, financial analysis, returns and reports (in addition if Officer is involved with marketing, sales or procurement Officer has had and will continue to have access to lists of customers, suppliers, vendors, and accounts, other sensitive information and data regarding the customers, suppliers, vendors, services, sales, pricing, and costs of Employer which are highly confidential and constitute trade secrets or confidential business information) which is the property of and integral to the operations and success of Employer, and therefore agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 8, which Officer agrees and acknowledges to be reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate and important business interests and concerns of
4
 
Employer.  Officer acknowledges that the information referred to above has independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.  Officer further acknowledges that Employer has taken all reasonable steps under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy and/or confidentiality of such information.
                        (c)        Officer agrees that Officer will not divulge to any person, nor use to the detriment of Employer, nor use in any business or process of manufacture competitive with or similar to any business or process of manufacture of Employer, at any time during Period of Employment or thereafter, any of the trade secrets and/or other confidential information of the Employer, whether in electronic form or otherwise, without first obtaining the express written permission of Employer. A trade secret shall include any information maintained as confidential and used by Employer in its business, including but not limited to a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that has value, actual or potential, from its confidentiality and from not being readily ascertainable to others who could also obtain value from such information.  For purposes of this Section 8, the compilation of information used by Employer in its business shall include, without limitation, the identity of customers and suppliers and information reflecting their interests, preferences, credit-worthiness, likely receptivity to solicitation for participation in various transactions and related information obtained during the course of Officer's employment with Employer.
                        (d)        Officer agrees that at the time of leaving the employ of Employer, Officer will deliver to Employer, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all originals and copies, electronic or hard copy, of notebooks, memoranda, documents, communications, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the business of Employer, or constituting property of the Employer.  Officer further agrees that Officer will not, directly or indirectly, request or advise any customers or suppliers of Employer to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with Employer.
                        (e)        During Officer's Period of Employment with the Employer and for a period of one (1) year after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer will not directly or indirectly, in the United States, participate in any Position in any business in Direct Competition with the business of the Employer.  The term
5
 
"Direct Competition," as used in this section, shall mean any business that directly competes against any line of business in which Officer was actively engaged during Officer's employment with Employer.  The term "Position," as used in this section, includes a partner, director, holder of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares, principal, executive, officer, manager or any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer, where Officer performs any duties which are substantially similar to those performed by the Officer during Officer's employment with Employer.  Officer acknowledges that a "substantially similar" position shall include any position in which Officer might be able to utilize the valuable, proprietary and confidential information to which Officer was exposed during Officer's employment with Employer.  It is acknowledged and agreed that the scope of the clause as set forth above is essential, because 1) a more restrictive definition of "Position" (e.g. limiting it to the "same" position with a competitor) will subject the Employer to serious, irreparable harm by allowing competitors to describe positions in ways to evade the operation of this clause, and substantially restrict the protection sought by Employer, and 2) by allowing the Officer to escape the application of this clause by accepting a position designated as a "lesser" or "different" position with a competitor, the Employer is unable to restrict the Officer from providing valuable information to such competing entity to the harm of the Employer.
                        (f)         Officer recognizes that Officer possesses confidential information and trade secrets about other employees of Employer relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, salary and benefits, and interpersonal relationships with customers and suppliers of Employer. Officer recognizes that the information Officer possesses about these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Employer in securing and retaining customers and suppliers, and was acquired by Officer because of Officer's business position with Employer.  Officer agrees that during Officer's Period of Employment hereunder, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive, if applicable, the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee or agent of Employer, with a view to or for the purposes of inducing or encouraging such employee or agent to leave the employ of Employer, for the purpose of being hired by Officer, any employer affiliated with Officer, or any competitor of Employer.  Officer agrees that Officer will not
6
 
convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees to anyone affiliated with Officer or to any competitor of Employer.
                        (g)        Officer acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect Employer's interest in this Agreement and that any breach thereof will result in an irreparable injury to Employer for which Employer has no adequate remedy at law.  Officer therefore agrees that, in the event Officer breaches any of the provisions contained in this Section 8, Employer shall be authorized and entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction (i) a temporary restraining order,  (ii) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,  (iii) an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such breach, (iv) direct, incidental and consequential damages arising from such breach; and/or (v) all reasonable legal fees and costs related to any actions taken by Employer to enforce Section 8.
                        (h)        Employer and Officer have attempted to specify a reasonable period of time, a reasonable area and reasonable restrictions to which this Section 8 shall apply.  Employer and Officer agree that if a court or administrative body should subsequently determine that the terms of this Section 8 are greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest, Employer agrees to waive those terms which are found by a court or administrative body to be greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest and to request that the court or administrative body reform this Agreement specifying a reasonable period of time and such other reasonable restrictions as the court or administrative body deems necessary.  Further, Officer agrees that Employer shall have the right to amend or modify this Section 8 as necessary to comport with the determination of any court or administrative body that such Section in this or a similar agreement entered into by Employer with any other officer or manager of Employer is greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest.
(i)  Officer further agrees that this Section 8, as well as the Sections 12 and 13 relating to choice of law and forum for resolution, are integral parts of this Agreement, and that should a court fail or refuse to enforce the restrictions contained herein in the manner expressly provided in Sections 8(a) through 8(g) above, the Employer shall recover from Officer, and the court shall award to the Employer, the consideration (or a pro-rata portion thereof to the extent these provisions are enforced but the time frame is reduced beyond that specified above) provided to and elected by Officer under the terms of Section 8(a) above (or the monetary equivalent thereof), its cost and its reasonable attorney's fees.  Officer acknowledges that such
7
award is not intended as "liquidated damages" and is not exclusive to other remedies available to Employer.  Instead such award is intended to ensure that Officer is not unjustly enriched as a result of retaining contract benefits not earned by Officer.
            9.  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including the terms of Section 7 hereof, Employer may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate this Agreement, and Officer's Period of Employment hereunder without any payment, liability or other obligation, in the event, (a) Officer engages in willful misconduct which results in injury to the Employer, or (b) Officer is convicted of a job-related felony or misdemeanor.   
Termination for Egregious Circumstances
            10.  .  Except as otherwise specified in this Section 10, this Agreement contains all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties hereto, and no other agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be deemed to exist or bind either of the parties hereto, except for (i) any pre-employment confidentiality agreement that may exist between the parties, and (ii) the stock grant(s) of  shares of Common Stock (the "Prior Stock Grant(s)") awarded to Officer under prior restricted stock grant agreement(s) ("Prior Agreement(s)"), which stock grant(s) shall continue and vest pursuant to the terms of the Prior Agreement(s) under which such grant(s) of Common Stock were made.  The parties agree that the continuation of the Prior Stock Grant(s) is additional consideration for the commitments made by Officer in Section 8 of this Agreement.  Except for the preservation of the Prior Stock Grant(s) as provided in this Section, this Agreement is intended to cancel and supercede the terms of the prior employment agreement between the Officer and the Company dated .  This Agreement cannot be modified except by a writing signed by both parties.
Modification

Officer may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without first obtaining the written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

            12.  .

            8. 
Additional Compensation, Confidential Information, Trade Secrets, Limitations on Solicitation and Non-Compete Clause.
                        (a)        Officer shall receive, in addition to all regular compensation for services as described in Section 3 of this Agreement, as additional consideration for signing this Agreement and for agreeing to abide and be bound by the terms, provisions and restrictions of this Section 8, the following:
                                    (i)         An award of  shares of Tyson Foods, Inc. Class A Common Stock ("Common Stock") subject to the terms and conditions of a restricted stock grant agreement currently in use by the Employer for awards to officers generally.
 20,676.6917
                                    (ii)        During Officer's Period of Employment on grant dates to be specified by Employer consistent with Employer's past practices for grants of options to Employees generally, a grant of  options to purchase shares of Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan ("Stock Plan"), and an option grant agreement currently in use by the Employer for officers generally.  
 8,000
                        (b)        Officer recognizes that, as a result of Officer's employment hereunder (and Officer's employment, if any, with Employer for periods prior to the Effective Date), Officer has had and will continue to have access to confidential information in multiple forms, electronic or otherwise, such confidential information including but not being limited to trade secrets, proprietary information, intellectual property, and other documents, data, and information concerning methods, processes, controls, techniques, formulas, production, distribution, purchasing, financial analysis, returns and reports (in addition if Officer is involved with marketing, sales or procurement Officer has had and will continue to have access to lists of customers, suppliers, vendors, and accounts, other sensitive information and data regarding the customers, suppliers, vendors, services, sales, pricing, and costs of Employer which are highly confidential and constitute trade secrets or confidential business information) which is the property of and integral to the operations and success of Employer, and therefore agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 8, which Officer agrees and acknowledges to be reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate and important business interests and concerns of Employer.  Officer acknowledges that the information referred to above has independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by
4
proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.  Officer further acknowledges that Employer has taken all reasonable steps under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy and/or confidentiality of such information.
                        (c)        Officer agrees that Officer will not divulge to any person, nor use to the detriment of Employer, nor use in any business or process of manufacture competitive with or similar to any business or process of manufacture of Employer, at any time during Period of Employment or thereafter, any of the trade secrets and/or other confidential information of the Employer, whether in electronic form or otherwise, without first obtaining the express written permission of Employer. A trade secret shall include any information maintained as confidential and used by Employer in its business, including but not limited to a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that has value, actual or potential, from its confidentiality and from not being readily ascertainable to others who could also obtain value from such information.  For purposes of this Section 8, the compilation of information used by Employer in its business shall include, without limitation, the identity of customers and suppliers and information reflecting their interests, preferences, credit-worthiness, likely receptivity to solicitation for participation in various transactions and related information obtained during the course of Officer's employment with Employer.
                        (d)        Officer agrees that at the time of leaving the employ of Employer, Officer will deliver to Employer, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all originals and copies, electronic or hard copy, of notebooks, memoranda, documents, communications, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the business of Employer, or constituting property of the Employer.  Officer further agrees that Officer will not, directly or indirectly, request or advise any customers or suppliers of Employer to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with Employer.
                        (e)        During Officer's Period of Employment with the Employer and for a period of one (1) year after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer will not directly or indirectly, in the United States, participate in any Position in any business in Direct Competition with the business of the Employer.  The term "Direct Competition," as used in this section, shall mean any business that directly competes against any line of business in which Officer was actively engaged during Officer's employment
5
with Employer.  The term "Position," as used in this section, includes a partner, director, holder of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares, principal, executive, officer, manager or any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer, where Officer performs any duties which are substantially similar to those performed by the Officer during Officer's employment with Employer.  Officer acknowledges that a "substantially similar" position shall include any position in which Officer might be able to utilize the valuable, proprietary and confidential information to which Officer was exposed during Officer's employment with Employer.  It is acknowledged and agreed that the scope of the clause as set forth above is essential, because 1) a more restrictive definition of "Position" (e.g. limiting it to the "same" position with a competitor) will subject the Employer to serious, irreparable harm by allowing competitors to describe positions in ways to evade the operation of this clause, and substantially restrict the protection sought by Employer, and 2) by allowing the Officer to escape the application of this clause by accepting a position designated as a "lesser" or "different" position with a competitor, the Employer is unable to restrict the Officer from providing valuable information to such competing entity to the harm of the Employer.
                        (f)         Officer recognizes that Officer possesses confidential information and trade secrets about other employees of Employer relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, salary and benefits, and interpersonal relationships with customers and suppliers of Employer. Officer recognizes that the information Officer possesses about these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Employer in securing and retaining customers and suppliers, and was acquired by Officer because of Officer's business position with Employer.  Officer agrees that during Officer's Period of Employment hereunder, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive, if applicable, the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee or agent of Employer, with a view to or for the purposes of inducing or encouraging such employee or agent to leave the employ of Employer, for the purpose of being hired by Officer, any employer affiliated with Officer, or any competitor of Employer.  Officer agrees that Officer will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees to anyone affiliated with Officer or to any competitor of Employer.

                        (g)        Officer acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect Employer's interest in this Agreement and that any breach thereof will result in an irreparable injury to Employer for which Employer has no adequate remedy at law.  Officer therefore agrees that, in the event Officer breaches any of the provisions contained in this Section 8, Employer shall be authorized and entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction (i) a temporary restraining order,  (ii) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,  (iii) an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such breach, (iv) direct, incidental and consequential damages arising from such breach; and/or (v) all reasonable legal fees and costs related to any actions taken by Employer to enforce Section 8.
                        (h)        Employer and Officer have attempted to specify a reasonable period of time, a reasonable area and reasonable restrictions to which this Section 8 shall apply.  Employer and Officer agree that if a court or administrative body should subsequently determine that the terms of this Section 8 are greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest, Employer agrees to waive those terms which are found by a court or administrative body to be greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest and to request that the court or administrative body reform this Agreement specifying a reasonable period of time and such other reasonable restrictions as the court or administrative body deems necessary.  Further, Officer agrees that Employer shall have the right to amend or modify this Section 8 as necessary to comport with the determination of any court or administrative body that such Section in this or a similar agreement entered into by Employer with any other officer or manager of Employer is greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employer's interest.
(i)  Officer further agrees that this Section 8, as well as the Sections 12 and 13 relating to choice of law and forum for resolution, are integral parts of this Agreement, and that should a court fail or refuse to enforce the restrictions contained herein in the manner expressly provided in Sections 8(a) through 8(g) above, the Employer shall recover from Officer, and the court shall award to the Employer, the consideration (or a pro-rata portion thereof to the extent these provisions are enforced but the time frame is reduced beyond that specified above) provided to and elected by Officer under the terms of Section 8(a) above (or the monetary equivalent thereof), its cost and its reasonable attorney's fees.  Officer acknowledges that such award is not intended as "liquidated damages" and is not exclusive to other remedies available to
7
Employer.  Instead such award is intended to ensure that Officer is not unjustly enriched as a result of retaining contract benefits not earned by Officer.
            9.  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including the terms of Section 7 hereof, Employer may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate this Agreement, and Officer's Period of Employment hereunder without any payment, liability or other obligation, in the event, (a) Officer engages in willful misconduct which results in injury to the Employer, or (b) Officer is convicted of a job-related felony or misdemeanor.   
Termination for Egregious Circumstances
            10.  .  Except as otherwise specified in this Section 10, this Agreement contains all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties hereto, and no other agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be deemed to exist or bind either of the parties hereto, except for (i) any pre-employment confidentiality agreement that may exist between the parties, and (ii) the stock grant(s) of  shares of Common Stock (the "Prior Stock Grant(s)") awarded to Officer under prior restricted stock grant agreement(s) ("Prior Agreement(s)"), which stock grant(s) shall continue and vest pursuant to the terms of the Prior Agreement(s) under which such grant(s) of Common Stock were made.  The parties agree that the continuation of the Prior Stock Grant(s) is additional consideration for the commitments made by Officer in Section 8 of this Agreement.  Except for the preservation of the Prior Stock Grant(s) as provided in this Section, this Agreement is intended to cancel and supercede the terms of the prior employment agreement between the Officer and the Company dated .  This Agreement cannot be modified except by a writing signed by both parties.
