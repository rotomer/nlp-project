Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 2, 2005, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the second quarter ending April 2, 2005.  The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Companys conference call relating to the press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a companys financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Companys financial statements. 
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, dispositions of assets or investments, BSE-related charges, litigation settlements and other similar events.  The Companys management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Companys operations.  Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Operating income for the first six months of fiscal 2005 was $312 million compared to $424 million and net income was $124 million compared to $176 million for the same period last year.
Pretax earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2005 included $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation, a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Companys remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. and $5 million of costs related to poultry and prepared foods plant closings.

John Tyson, chairman and CEO, said, Sales increased across all four of our primary operating segments during the second quarter.  The Chicken segment in particular delivered strong performance as a result of increased prices and lower grain costs.  In addition, we continued to improve our sales mix of value added chicken, beef and pork products.   Looking forward we expect strong chicken demand and improving domestic cattle supplies to result in significant improvements in our results in the second half of the fiscal year, compared to the first two quarters.

Segment Performance Review (in millions)
 
 
 
TYSON FOODS, INC. News Release May 2, 2005 Page 3 of 8
Chicken (32.3% of Net Sales, 78.1% of Total Operating Income  2nd Quarter 2005)                 (32.2% of Net Sales, 79.2% of Total Operating Income  Six Months 2005)                 - -
Improved pricing and product mix led to increased sales in the Chicken segment.
Chicken segment sales increased by 0.6% and 4.5% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.  Sales increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to increased average sales prices and improved product mix, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes. Sales for the six months of fiscal 2005 increased primarily due to an increase in average sales prices, improved product mix, as well as a slight increase in sales volumes.
Operating income was negatively impacted by losses of approximately $10 million and $33 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, compared to commodity risk management gains of approximately $90 million and $103 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2004.  However, the current year losses of $10 million and $33 million were offset by approximately $73 million and $84 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, in decreased grain costs as compared to the same periods last year.  Additionally, operating income for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005 includes $2 million of plant closing related accruals, as compared to $8 million and $12 million recorded in the same periods last year.
Beef (43.6% of Net Sales, (10.4)% of Total Operating Income  2nd Quarter 2005)          (43.5% of Net Sales, (11.2)% of Total Operating Income  Six Months 2005)        
-Sales in domestic and international fresh meats were negatively impacted by Canadian live cattle import           restrictions, limited access to export markets, weaker domestic demand and competing protein supplies.
Beef segment sales increased by 2.9% and decreased by 4.5% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.  Sales increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to increased average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes.  Sales decreases in the six months of fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from BSE-related import and export restrictions that were in effect for the entire six months of fiscal 2005, while the same restrictions began in the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  Those restrictions led to lower international sales volumes and lower average sales prices due to the mix of products allowed for export.   Beef segment operating loss increased by $17 million and $4 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year.  Excluding $10 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation in the six months of fiscal 2005 and BSE-related charges of $61 million recorded in the six months of fiscal 2004, operating loss increased $75 million.  The increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower domestic cattle supplies and restrictions on imports of Canadian cattle resulting in lower plant utilization levels.  Also second quarter fiscal 2005 operating loss was negatively impacted by higher live costs as compared to the same period last year.  Sales and operating loss were positively impacted by $13 million in net gains and negatively impacted by $1 million in net losses in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, as compared to $7 million in net gains and $17 million in net losses for the same periods last year, related to open mark-to-market futures positions from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef sales.  Additionally, the Beef segments operating margins improved in the latter part of the quarter.

Pork (13.0% of Net Sales, 10.4% of Total Operating Income  2nd Quarter 2005)           (13.1% of Net Sales, 10.9% of Total Operating Income  Six Months 2005)            -
Continued demand for pork products both domestically and internationally led to sales              increases caused by higher average sales prices, but were offset by higher live prices              resulting in decreased operating margins.
Pork segment sales increased by 13.1% and 14.0% for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.  The increase in sales resulted from continued strong demand for pork products both domestically and internationally which resulted in an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in volumes.  Operating income declined by $15 million and $49 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year.  The decreases in operating income were primarily due to higher live prices, which more than offset the increase in average sales prices. 
 
Prepared Foods (10.9% of Net Sales, 10.9% of Total Operating Income  2nd Quarter 2005)                              (11.1% of Net Sales, 10.3% of Total Operating Income  Six Months 2005)             -
Higher average selling prices led to increased sales in the Prepared Foods segment.
Prepared Foods segment sales increased by 3.1% and 2.4% for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.  Sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, partially offset by lower volumes.   Excluding plant closing related accruals of $3 million recorded in the six months of fiscal 2005, and $6 million and $27 million recorded in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2004, operating income decreased $6 million and $18 million, respectively.  The decrease in the Prepared Foods segments operating income for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increased raw material prices.
