Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On August 1, 2005, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the third quarter ending July 2, 2005. The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Company's conference call relating to the press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements.
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, dispositions of assets or investments, BSE-related charges, litigation settlements and other similar events. The Company's management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Limitation on Incorporation by Reference
In accordance with general instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report, including exhibits, is furnished pursuant to Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.

TYSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER AND
NINE MONTHS RESULTS
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  August 1, 2005 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported $0.36 diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2005, compared to $0.45 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Third quarter 2005 sales were $6.7 billion compared to $6.6 billion for the same period last year. Operating income was $263 million compared to $323 million and net income was $131 million compared to $161 million for the same period last year.
Pretax earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 included $33 million of costs related to a legal settlement involving the Company's live swine operations, as well as $10 million of costs related to poultry plant closings
resulting from the on-going effort to increase the production of value-added products and enhance operating efficiencies. The combined effect of these items decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.08.
Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 were $0.71 compared to $0.94 in the same period last year. Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 were $19.5 billion compared to $19.3 billion for the same period last year. Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 was $575 million compared to $747 million and net income was $255 million compared to $337 million for the same period last year.
Pretax earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 included $33 million of costs related to a legal settlement involving the Company's live swine operations, $15 million of costs related to poultry and prepared foods plant closings, $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Company's remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. The combined effect of these items decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.05.
Pretax earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 included $40 million of costs related to poultry and prepared foods plant closings, and $61 million of costs of BSE-related charges. The combined effect of these items decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.18.
John Tyson, chairman and CEO, said, "The Chicken segment performed well, and Beef and Prepared Foods improved compared to the first half of the year, but our Pork results were disappointing. We continued to generate strong cash flow which enabled us to achieve our debt to capital goal one quarter earlier than expected. Our value-added product mix continues to grow and we expect it to reach 40% by the end of our fiscal year. We made progress on our effort to improve our operating efficiencies. However, we also expect the fourth quarter to be more challenging."

Chicken (31.1% of Net Sales, 75.3% of Total Operating Income  3rd Quarter 2005)
Chicken segment operating income for the third quarter fiscal 2005 increased $62 million excluding plant closing related accruals of $10 million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, and $1 million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was 10.0% excluding those plant closing related accruals. Operating income for the third quarter was positively impacted by decreased grain costs of $113 million as compared to the same period last year. However, the current period benefits from decreased grain costs were partially offset by the effect of the Company realizing a gain of $5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to a gain of $44 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases.
Chicken segment volume increased by 1.4% and 0.7% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales decreased by 1.2% and increased by 2.5% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales decreased in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to lower average sales prices, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes. Sales for the nine months of fiscal 2005 increased primarily due to an increase in average sales prices, as well as a slight increase in sales volumes.
Operating income for the nine months of fiscal 2005 decreased $6 million excluding plant closing related accruals of $12 million recorded in fiscal 2005 and $13 million recorded in fiscal 2004. Operating income for the nine months of fiscal 2005 was positively impacted by decreased grain costs of $197 million as compared to the same period last year. However, the current year benefits from decreased grain costs were partially offset by the effect of the Company realizing a loss of $28 million in the fiscal 2005 as compared to a gain of $147 million in fiscal 2004 from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by higher energy costs.
 
Beef (46.2% of Net Sales, 13.7% of Total Operating Income  3rd Quarter 2005)
Beef segment volume increased by 2.3% and 0.5% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Beef segment sales increased by 4.3% and decreased by 1.5% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher average sales prices and increased sales volumes. Sales decreases in the nine months of fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from BSE-related import and export restrictions that were in effect for the entire nine months of fiscal 2005, while the same restrictions began in the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Those restrictions led to lower international sales volumes and lower average sales prices due to the mix of products allowed for export.
Beef segment operating income decreased by $82 million and $86 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. Excluding $10 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation in the nine months of fiscal 2005 and BSE-related charges of $61 million recorded in the nine months of fiscal 2004, operating income decreased $157 million. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower domestic cattle supplies and restrictions on imports of Canadian cattle resulting in lower plant utilization levels. Also, third quarter fiscal 2005 operating income was negatively impacted by higher live costs as compared to the same period last year. Additionally, sales and operating income were negatively impacted by $13 million and $14 million in net losses in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, as compared to $45 million and $28 million in net gains for the same periods last year, related to open mark-to-market futures positions from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to its fixed price forward boxed beef sales.

Pork (12.1% of Net Sales, (7.2)% of Total Operating Income  3rd Quarter 2005)
Pork segment sales decreased by 2.1% and increased by 8.2% for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales decreased in third quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to decreased sales volumes and lower average domestic sales prices.
Sales increases for the nine months of fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from stronger demand for pork products, both domestically and internationally, as compared to the same periods last year. The increased demand resulted in higher average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in volumes.
Excluding costs of $33 million related to a legal settlement involving the Company's live swine operations, operating income decreased $20 million and $69 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. The decreases in operating income for the nine months were primarily due to higher live prices and lower volumes, which more than offset the increase in average sales prices. Additionally, sales and operating income for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by $8 million in net losses related to open mark-to-market futures positions from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to its fixed price forward boxed pork sales.
Prepared Foods (10.4% of Net Sales, 10.6% of Total Operating Income  3rd Quarter 2005)
(10.9% of Net Sales, 10.4% of Total Operating Income  Nine Months 2005)
Prepared Foods segment operating income increased by $21 million in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year. Excluding plant closing related accruals of $3 million recorded in the nine months of fiscal 2005, and $27 million recorded in the nine months of fiscal 2004, operating income increased $3 million. The increase in operating income for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in average sales prices, offset partially by higher raw material prices. Sales decreased by 1.6% and increased by 1.0% for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales decreased in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average sales prices. Decreased sales volumes for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 were more than offset by higher averages sales prices.
