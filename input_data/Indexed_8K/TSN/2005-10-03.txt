(b) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank, with respect to amounts payable to it hereunder, and the Administrative Agent, with respect to all amounts payable hereunder, shall maintain on its books, in accordance with its usual practice, loan accounts, setting forth each Committed Loan and, (i) in the case of each Lender having made a Bid Loan, each such Bid Loan and (ii) in the case of an Issuing Bank, each Letter of Credit, the applicable interest rate and the amounts of L/C Disbursements, principal, interest and other sums paid and payable by the Borrower from time to time hereunder with respect thereto;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender or Issuing Bank to record any such amount on its books shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower with respect thereto. In the case of any dispute, action or proceeding relating to any amount payable hereunder, the entries in each such account shall be conclusive evidence of such amount absent manifest error.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Lender shall so request for purposes of Section 10.08(g), the obligation to repay the Committed Loans made by it shall also be evidenced by a promissory note in the form of Exhibit 2.05(c).

23
 
 
SECTION 2.06.
Termination, Reductions, Increases and Extensions of the Commitments
. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments and the L/C Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
(b) The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, upon not less than three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments or permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments by an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;
provided
,
however
, that no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayment of Loans made on the effective date thereof, the sum of the Aggregate Committed Credit Exposure plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Bid Loans would exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect and,
provided
,
further
, that, except as set forth in Section 2.06(c), once reduced in accordance with this Section 2.06, the Aggregate Commitments may not be increased. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to each Lender's Commitment in accordance with such Lender's Percentage Share.
(c) The Borrower may on one or more occasions, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Borrower and one or more financial institutions (any such financial institution being called an "
Increasing Lender
"), which may include any consenting Lender, cause Commitments to be extended by the Increasing Lenders (or cause the Commitments of the Increasing Lenders to be increased, as the case may be) in an amount for each Increasing Lender (which shall not be less than $10,000,000) set forth in such notice;
provided
, that (i) no extension of new Commitments or increase in existing Commitments pursuant to this paragraph may result in the aggregate amount of the new Commitments and increases in Commitments extended or effected under this paragraph exceeding $350,000,000, (ii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (iii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a duly executed accession agreement in a form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an "
Accession Agreement
"). New Commitments and increases in Commitments under this paragraph shall become effective on the date specified in the applicable notices delivered as provided above. Upon the effectiveness of any Accession Agreement to which any Increasing Lender is a party, (i) such Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to and a Lender under this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder and (ii) Schedule 1.01(a) shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the Commitment of such Increasing Lender as provided in such Accession Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of any increase pursuant to this Section in the Commitment of a Lender already a party hereto, Schedule 1.01(a) shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the increased Commitment of such Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Aggregate Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this Section unless, on the date of such increase, the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate, dated as of the effective date of such increase and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 5.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase and with all references in Sections 4.05(b) and 4.06 to the Effective Date being deemed
 
 
24
 
to be references to the effective date of such increase). Following any extension of a new Commitment or increase of a Lender's Commitment pursuant to this paragraph, (A) any Eurodollar Loans outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such increase or extension shall continue outstanding until the ends of the respective Interests Periods applicable thereto, and shall then be repaid and, if the Borrower shall so elect, refinanced with new Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to Section 2.01(a) ratably in accordance with the Commitments in effect following such extension or increase and (B) any Reference Rate Loans outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such increase or extension shall be promptly repaid and, if the Borrower shall so elect, refinanced with new Reference Rate Loans made pursuant to Section 2.01(a) ratably in accordance with the Commitments in effect following such extension or increase.
(d) The Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks) given not less than 45 days and not more than 75 days prior to any anniversary of the date hereof prior to the year in which the Maturity Date occurs, request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional period of not more than one year (each, an "
Additional Period
") as specified in such notice. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent given not later than 15 Business Days after the Borrower's notice, advise the Borrower whether or not it agrees to such extension. Any Lender that has not so advised the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension. If the Borrower shall have requested and Lenders representing more than 50% of the Aggregate Commitments (excluding Commitments, if any, that will expire prior to the Existing Maturity Date (as defined below)) shall have agreed to an extension of the Maturity Date, then the Maturity Date shall be extended for such Additional Period, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender and each Issuing Bank of such extension. The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any extension of the Maturity Date hereunder shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender. The Commitment of any Lender that has declined, or is deemed to have declined, to agree to any requested extension of the Maturity Date (a "
Non-Extending Lender
") shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (the "
Existing Maturity Date
"), and on the Existing Maturity Date, (i) the principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by each Non-Extending Lender, together with any accrued interest thereon, and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Lender hereunder, shall be due and payable, and (ii) the Borrower shall make such additional prepayments of Loans pursuant to Section 2.07 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Non-Extending Lenders pursuant to this sentence, (x) the aggregate amount of the outstanding Loans and LC Exposures will not exceed the Aggregate Commitments and (y) the Committed Credit Exposure of each Lender will not exceed its Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Maturity Date shall become effective under this Section unless, on the date of such extension, the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate, dated as of the effective date of such extension and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 5.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such extension and with all references in Sections 4.05(b) and 4.06 to the Effective Date being deemed to be references to the effective date of such extension). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Borrower shall have the right, any time prior to the Existing Maturity Date, to withdraw its request for an extension under this paragraph by notice to the Administrative
 
 
25
 
Agent (which shall promptly deliver a notice to each Lender and Issuing Bank), in which case the Commitments of all the Lenders will terminate on the Existing Maturity Date.
SECTION 2.07.
Optional Prepayments
. (a) Subject to Section 3.10, the Borrower may upon notice to the Administrative Agent, stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) (i) not less than three Business Days prior to the proposed date of prepayment, in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) not less than one Business Day prior to the proposed date of prepayment, in the case of a prepayment of Reference Rate Loans, prepay ratably among the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of any Committed Loans in whole or in part, together (other than in the case of a prepayment of Reference Rate Loans prior to the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date of termination of the Commitments hereunder) with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. Each such partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;
provided
,
however
, that if the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Loans comprised in the same Borrowing shall be reduced as a result of any optional prepayment to an amount less than $5,000,000, the Eurodollar Loans comprised in such Borrowing shall automatically convert into Reference Rate Loans at the end of the then current Interest Period. If any notice of prepayment is given, the principal amount stated therein, together (other than in the case of a prepayment of Reference Rate Loans prior to the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date of termination of the Commitments hereunder) with accrued interest to the date of prepayment, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such notice. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
(b) The Borrower may not voluntarily prepay any Bid Loan prior to the maturity date thereof.
SECTION 2.08.
Interest
. (a) Subject to Section 2.09, each Committed Loan shall bear interest, at the option of the Borrower (i) in the case of a Reference Rate Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Reference Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate or (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBOR
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(b) Accrued and unpaid interest in respect of each Committed Loan shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date, on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date of termination of the Commitments hereunder and (other than in the case of a Reference Rate Loan) on the date of any prepayment or repayment of such Loan.
(c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender which has made a Bid Loan interest on the unpaid principal amount of such Bid Loan from the date when made until paid in full, on each Interest Payment Date and on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date of termination of the Commitments hereunder, at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus (or minus) the LIBOR Bid Margin, or the Absolute Rate, as the case may be, as specified by such Lender in its Competitive Bid pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(ii).
 
 
 
26
 
 
SECTION 2.09.
Default Interest
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.08, if any principal of or interest on any Loan, any fee, or any payment required to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement in respect of any Letter of Credit (including payments in respect of reimbursements of disbursements, interest thereon and obligations to provide cash collateral) or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in Section 2.08 or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% per annum plus the rate applicable to Reference Rate Loans as provided in paragraph (a)(i) of Section 2.08.
SECTION 2.10.

(iii) elect to continue, on the expiration date of any Interest Period, any Eurodollar Loans maturing on such Interest Payment Date;
provided
,
however
, that if on the expiration date of any Interest Period the aggregate amount of outstanding Eurodollar Loans comprised in the same Committed Borrowing shall have been reduced as a result of the conversion of part thereof to an amount less than $5,000,000, the remaining Eurodollar Loans comprised in such Borrowing shall automatically convert into Reference Rate Loans on such date and on and after such date the right of the Borrower to continue such Loans as Eurodollar Loans shall terminate.
(b) The Borrower shall deliver a notice of conversion or continuation (a "
Notice of Conversion/Continuation
"), in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.10, to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) (i) three Business Days prior to the proposed date of conversion or continuation, if the Committed Loans or any portion thereof are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Loans; and (ii) one Business Day prior to the proposed date of conversion, if the Committed Loans or any portion thereof are to be converted into Reference Rate Loans. Each such Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall be by facsimile confirmed immediately by telephone specifying therein:

(ii) the aggregate amount of Committed Loans to be converted or continued;
(iii) the nature of the proposed conversion or continuation; and
 
 
 
27
 
 
(iv) the duration of the requested Interest Period.
(c) If, upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to Eurodollar Loans, the Borrower shall have failed to select a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans, or if an Event of Default shall then have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Loans into Reference Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.
(d) Upon receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof or, if no timely notice is provided, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion. Each conversion and continuation shall be made
pro
rata
among the Lenders based on the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans of each Lender included in the Borrowing with respect to which such notice was given.
(e) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of any Committed Loans, there shall not be more than twelve different Interest Periods in effect in respect of all Committed Loans together.
SECTION 2.11.
Letters of Credit
. (a)
General
. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) each of the Existing Letters of Credit shall, upon the Effective Date and without further action on the part of any Issuing Bank or any other person, be deemed for all purposes to be a Letter of Credit issued hereunder on the date hereof and (ii) the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in US Dollars for its own account, in form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Banks, at any time and from time to time while the Commitments remain in effect. This Section shall not be construed to impose an obligation upon any Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit that is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(b)
Notice of Issuance; Certain Conditions
. In order to request the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall hand deliver, fax, telecopy or transmit via electronic means (in a form acceptable to the Issuing Bank) to an Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit and setting forth the date of issuance, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) below), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare such Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued only if, and upon issuance of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that, after giving effect to such issuance (i) the sum of (x) the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Bid Loans made by all Lenders
plus
(y) the Aggregate Committed Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (ii) the portion of L/C Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit of the Issuing Bank requested to issue such Letter of Credit shall not exceed the L/C Commitment of such Issuing Bank and (iii) if the Maturity Date shall have been extended pursuant to Section 2.06(d) with respect to some of but not all the Lenders, the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit with expiry dates after any Existing Maturity Date (as defined in Section 2.06(d)) will not exceed the portion of the Aggregate
 
 
28
 
Commitments attributable to the Commitments of the Lenders with respect to which the Maturity Date shall have been extended beyond such Existing Maturity Date.
(c)
Expiration Date.
Each Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of business not later than the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date;
provided
that at the request of the Borrower any Letter of Credit may contain customary "evergreen" provisions pursuant to which such Letter of Credit will, in the absence of a notice given by the applicable Issuing Bank, be automatically renewed (but in no event beyond the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date) for successive one-year periods.
(d)
Participations
. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquires from the applicable Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Percentage Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender's Percentage Share of each L/C Disbursement made by each Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower forthwith on the date due, as provided in Section 2.02(e). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is irrevocable, absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e)
Reimbursement
. If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than two hours after the Borrower shall have received notice from the Issuing Bank that payment of such draft will be made, or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day;
provided
that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth in Section 5.02, request in accordance with Section 2.02 that such reimbursement obligation be financed with Reference Rate Loans in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower shall have complied with its obligation under this paragraph (e) to make such payment.
(f)
Obligations Absolute
. The Borrower's obligations to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein;
 
 
 
29
 
 
(ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document;
(iii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or otherwise obligated with, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other person may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or transaction;
(iv) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
(v) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
(vi) any other act, or omission to act, or delay of any kind of any Issuing Bank, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any other person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Borrower hereunder to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Banks. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. The parties hereto expressly agree that (i) an Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under a Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to the Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in substantial
 
 
30
 
compliance with the terms of the Letter of Credit, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged, fraudulent or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under the Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the applicable Issuing Bank.
(g)
Disbursement Procedures
. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by telecopy, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender notice thereof.
(h)
Interim Interest
. If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on such date, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest for the account of the Issuing Bank, for each day from and including the date of such L/C Disbursement, to but excluding the earlier of the date of payment by the Borrower or the date on which interest shall commence to accrue thereon as provided in Section 2.02(e), at the rate per annum that would apply to such amount if such amount were a Reference Rate Loan.
(i)
Resignation or Removal of an Issuing Bank
. An Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower, and may be removed at any time by the Borrower by notice to such Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Upon the resignation or removal of an Issuing Bank hereunder, such Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its obligations to issue additional Letters of Credit hereunder. At the time such resignation or removal shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all fees accrued for the account of the Issuing Bank under Section 3.01(c)(ii) and not yet paid. After the resignation or removal of an Issuing Bank hereunder, such Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or removal, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

From time to time, the Borrower may by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders designate one or more Lenders as additional Issuing Banks. The acceptance by a Lender of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement (an "
Issuing Bank Agreement
"), which shall be in a form satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, shall set forth the L/C Commitment and Issuing Bank Fees of such Lender and shall be executed by such Lender, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other
 
 
31
 
Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an Issuing Bank.
(k)
Cash Collateralization.
If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Borrower shall, on the Business Day it receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders holding participations in outstanding Letters of Credit representing greater than 50% of the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit) thereof and of the amount to be deposited, deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the L/C Exposure as of such date. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits in Permitted Investments, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall (i) automatically be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for L/C Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed, (ii) be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the L/C Exposure at such time and (iii) if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders holding participations in outstanding Letters of Credit representing greater than 50% of the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit), be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
(l)
Reporting Requirements of Issuing Bank
. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amount thereof shall have changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not effect any issuance, renewal, extension or amendment resulting in an increase in the aggregate amount of the Letters of Credit issued by it without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such increase is then permitted under this Agreement, (ii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iii) on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.

ARTICLE III
 
Fees; Payments; Taxes; Changes in Circumstances
SECTION 3.01.
Fees
. (a) (i) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee at the Applicable Rate per annum on such Lender's Commitment (regardless of utilization) or, after the Maturity Date, the product of the Applicable Rate and the aggregate daily outstanding amount of such Lender's Committed Credit Exposure.
(ii) The facility fee shall accrue from the date hereof to the Maturity Date and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing in the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2005 and on the Maturity Date,
provided
that if there shall be any Committed Credit Exposures after the Maturity Date, then the facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily outstanding amount of such Committed Credit Exposures from and including the Maturity Date to but excluding the date on which there cease to be any Committed Credit Exposures, and such facility fee shall be payable on demand.
(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the Administrative Agent's own account, fees in the amounts and at the times set forth in the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter.
(c) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to each Lender, through the Administrative Agent, on the last business day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitment of such Lender shall be terminated as provided herein, a fee (an "
L/C Participation Fee
") calculated on such Lender's Percentage Share of the average daily aggregate L/C Exposure (excluding the portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements) during the preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date hereof or ending with the Maturity Date or the date on which all Letters of Credit have been canceled or have expired and the Commitments of all Lenders shall have been terminated) at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Loans, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, on the last business day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments shall have terminated and there shall not remain outstanding any Letter of Credit of such Issuing Bank, (A) a fronting fee equal to a percentage per annum agreed upon by the Borrower and such Issuing Bank on the average daily undrawn amount of such Letters of Credit during the preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date hereof or ending with the Maturity Date or the date on which all such Letters of Credit have been canceled or have expired and the Commitments of all Lenders shall have been terminated) and (B) the standard issuance, drawing and amendment fees specified from time to time by such Issuing Bank (the amounts referred to in the preceding clauses (A) and (B) being collectively called the "
Issuing Bank Fees
"). All L/C Participation Fees and Issuing Bank Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.
(d) All fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders, except that the
 
 
33
 
Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid directly to the applicable Issuing Banks. Once paid, none of the fees shall be refundable under any circumstances;
provided
,
however
, that the foregoing shall in no event constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect any claims the Borrower may have against any other party to this Agreement.
SECTION 3.02.
Computation of Fees and Interest
. (a) All computations of interest payable in respect of Reference Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed. Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which such interest or fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.
SECTION 3.03.
Payments by the Borrower
. (a) All payments (including prepayments and payments of principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any reimbursement of L/C Disbursement or any fees or other amounts) to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall, except as expressly provided herein, be made to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders or for the accounts of the applicable Issuing Banks at the Administrative Agent's Payment Office, in dollars and in immediately available funds, not later than 12:00 noon New York City time on the date specified herein;
provided
,
however
, that unless otherwise specified herein, (i) each payment in respect of a Bid Loan shall be made directly to the relevant Lender to the Lending Office of such Lender and (ii) Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid directly to the applicable Issuing Banks. The Administrative Agent will promptly after receiving any payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts from the Borrower, in the case of payments for the accounts of the Lenders, distribute to each Lender its Percentage Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such payment for the account of its respective Lending Office and, in the case of each other payment received by it for the account of any other Person, distribute such payment to the appropriate recipient. Any payment received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00 noon (New York City time) shall be deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day.
(b) Whenever any payment of a Committed Loan (and unless otherwise stated in the relevant Competitive Bid Request, a Bid Loan) shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest and fees, as the case may be;
provided
,
however
, that if such extension would cause any payment of principal of or interest on Eurodollar Loans to be made in the next calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the
 
 
34
 
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, the excess of the amount distributed to such Lender over the amount, if any, paid by the Borrower, together with interest thereon at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender to the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 3.04.
Payments by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent
.
(a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender on the Effective Date, or, with respect to each Committed Borrowing after the Effective Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower the amount of such Lender's Percentage Share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such full amount available to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances makes available to the Borrower such amount, such Lender shall, within two Business Days following the date of such Borrowing, make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation for and determined as of each day during such period. If such amount is so made available, such payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan on the date of the Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent within two Business Days following the date of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of such failure to fund and, on the third Business Day following the date of such Borrowing, the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing. Nothing contained in this Section 3.04(a) shall relieve any Lender which has failed to make available its Percentage Share of any Committed Borrowing hereunder from its obligation to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.
(b) The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan on the date of any Committed Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make a Loan on the date of such Borrowing pursuant to the provisions contained herein, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender.
SECTION 3.05.
Taxes.
(a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that if any Loan Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
 
 
35
 
payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authorities in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any Obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. After the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, receives written notice from a relevant taxing authority of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes subject to the provisions of Section 3.05, such party will act in good faith to promptly notify the Borrower of its obligations hereunder.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Loan Party is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate including, without limitation, IRS Forms W-8ECI and W-8BEN (and any successor forms thereto), as applicable. In addition, each such Lender agrees that it will deliver upon the Borrower's request updated versions of the foregoing documents whenever they become obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, together with such other forms or documents as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to continued exemption from or reduction of withholding tax;
provided
however, that no Lender shall be required to provide any documents or forms which it cannot deliver under applicable law because such Lender is no longer entitled to an exemption of withholding tax due to a change in applicable law. Each Lender shall promptly notify the
 
 
36
 
Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation to the Borrower. If a Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party did not properly withhold an Indemnified Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (but only to the extent such claim arises because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed, because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in its circumstances (other than a change in law) which rendered an exemption from withholding tax ineffective or because of such Lender's sale of a participating interest in a Loan), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and/or any Loan Party, as applicable, fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent and/or any Loan Party, as Tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest together with all costs, expenses and attorney's fees (including the allocated cost of in-house counsel).
(f) If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.05, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Parties under this Section 3.05 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
, that the Borrower agrees, upon the request of such Agent or such Lender, to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
SECTION 3.06.
Sharing of Payments, Etc.
If other than as provided in Section 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10 or 3.11, any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Committed Loan made by it and, after acceleration of all Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02(b), in respect of any Obligation owing to it (including with respect to any Bid Loan), in the case of the Committed Loan, in excess of its Percentage Share of payments on account of the Committed Loans obtained by all the Lenders and, after acceleration, in excess of its
pro
rata
share of all Obligations, such Lender shall forthwith (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Committed Loans made by them or, after acceleration, in all Obligations owing to them, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of the other Lenders according to their respective Percentage Shares or, after acceleration, their
pro
rata
shares of all the Obligations;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to the extent of such recovery be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price thereof together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
 
 
37
 
recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.06 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error), of participations purchased pursuant to this Section 3.06 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases.
SECTION 3.07.
Inadequacy of LIBOR
. If, with respect to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Loans, the Administrative Agent shall determine, or the Majority Lenders shall notify the Administrative Agent, that LIBOR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period (after giving effect to any event giving rise to additional interest on such Loans pursuant to Section 3.11), the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon the obligations of the Lenders to make or continue Committed Loans as Eurodollar Loans or to convert Committed Loans into Eurodollar Loans at the end of the then current Interest Period shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke its Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the Borrower does not revoke such notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Committed Loans, as proposed by the Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Reference Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Loans.
SECTION 3.08.
Increased Costs
. If any Lender or Issuing Bank shall determine that, due to either (a) the introduction of any Requirement of Law or any change (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation thereof or (b) the compliance with any guideline or request made after the date hereof by any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Committed Loan or any Letter of Credit or participation therein, respectively, the Borrower shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender or Issuing Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or Issuing Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank for such increased costs (other than costs for Taxes contemplated by Section 3.05 or reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.06).
SECTION 3.09.
Capital Adequacy
. If any Lender or Issuing Bank shall have determined that the introduction of, or change in, any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy, including any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority, or the compliance therewith by such Lender or Issuing Bank (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender or Issuing Bank, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or Issuing Bank or any corporation controlling such Lender or Issuing Bank and such
 
 
38
 
Lender or Issuing Bank (taking into consideration such Lender's, such Issuing Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's or Issuing Bank's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's Commitment, loans or obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Committed Borrowing or any Letters of Credit, respectively, then from time to time, upon demand of such Lender or Issuing Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall be liable for, and shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or Issuing Bank, as specified by such Lender or Issuing Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank for such increase.
SECTION 3.10.
Funding Losses
. The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of:
(a) any failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Eurodollar Loan after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation;
(b) any prepayment or payment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto;
(c) any failure of the Borrower to make any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.07;
(d) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to a Reference Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the respective Interest Period pursuant to Section 2.10; or
(e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.13;
including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Loans hereunder or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
SECTION 3.11.
Additional Interest on Eurodollar Loans
. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, at the request of such Lender (but not more frequently than once in each calendar quarter), as long as such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender from the date such Eurodollar Loan is made until such principal amount is paid in full, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (a) LIBOR for the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan from (b) the rate obtained by dividing such LIBOR by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date interest in respect of such Eurodollar Loan is payable. Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous sentence, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay to any Lender any additional interest in respect of Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender
 
 
39
 
for any period commencing more than three months prior to the date on which such Lender notifies the Borrower by delivering a certificate from a financial officer of such Lender, that such Lender is required to maintain reserves with respect to Eurocurrency Liabilities.
SECTION 3.12.
Certificates of Lenders
. Any Lender claiming reimbursement or compensation pursuant to Section 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10 and/or 3.11 shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for computing the amount payable to such Lender hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the Borrower shall pay to any Lender claiming compensation or reimbursement from the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.08, 3.09, 3.10 or 3.11, the amount requested by such Lender no later than five Business Days after such demand.
SECTION 3.13.
Change of Lending Office; Replacement Lender
. (a) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.05(a) or (c) or Sections 3.08, 3.09 or 3.11 with respect to such Lender or Issuing Bank, it will if so requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section;
provided
,
however
, that such designation would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Nothing in this Section 3.13 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender or Issuing Bank provided in Section 3.05(a) or (c) or Sections 3.08, 3.09 or 3.11.
(b) In the event the Borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts to any Lender pursuant to Sections 3.05(a) or (c), 3.08 , 3.09 or 3.11 as a result of any condition described in any such Section, then, unless such Lender has theretofore taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured, the conditions creating the cause for such obligation to pay such additional amounts, the Borrower may designate another Lender which is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (such Lender being herein called a "
Replacement Lender
") to purchase the Committed Loans of such Lender and such Lender's rights hereunder, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender for a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans payable to such Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans and accrued but unpaid fees in respect of such Lender's Commitment and any other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, and to assume all the obligations of such Lender hereunder (except for such rights as survive repayment of the Loans), and, upon such purchase, such Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights hereunder (except those related to any Bid Loans of such Lender which remain outstanding and those that survive full payment hereunder) and shall be relieved from all obligations to the Borrower hereunder, and the Replacement Lender shall succeed to the rights and obligations of such Lender hereunder;
provided
that, if the Borrower elects to exercise such rights pursuant to this Section 3.13 with respect to any Lender that has made a request for compensation pursuant to Section 3.11, it shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made similar requests for compensation pursuant to Section 3.11.

(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an
"Assignee"
) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:
(A) the Borrower,
provided
that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, a Lender Affiliate or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee,
(B) the Administrative Agent,
provided
that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to a Lender Affiliate; and

(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Committed Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Committed Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent;
provided,
that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this clause (B) shall not apply to rights in respect of outstanding Bid Loans,
(C) the Assignee and the Assignor in respect of each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and
(D) the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10, 3.11 and 10.05) (but only to the extent such Lender notifies the Borrower of any claim under such Section within 90 days after it obtains knowledge thereof). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
(c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
 
 
70

No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, any Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 10.02 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.05, 3.06, 3.08, 3.09 and 3.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.06 as though it were a Lender,
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.06 as though it were a Lender. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (a) has purchased a participation in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent ("
Voting Participant Notification
"), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a "
Voting Participant
") and (c) receives the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an Assignee as set forth in Exhibit 10.08 hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation purchased. The Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph.
 
 
 
71
 
 
(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.05, 3.08, 3.09 or 3.10 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.05 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.05(f) as though it were a Lender.
(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender to (i) a Federal Reserve Bank or (ii) the Farm Credit Funding Corp. or to any other entity organized under the Farm Credit Act, as amended, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION 10.09.

. The Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all non-public information provided to it by the Borrower or on the Borrower's behalf in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except that such information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel and other advisors and other agents who in each case have a need to know such information in connection with the Transactions or the provision of other financial products or services to the Borrower (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the disclosing party, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those contained in this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or any similar confidentiality undertaking by which the disclosing part is bound or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.

Each Lender further agrees to retain such records in the manner and for the periods provided in applicable provincial or Federal statutes and regulations of Canada and to provide such records to the Borrower upon its request and at its expense. Upon request by the Borrower, a Lender shall cancel all forms of B/A that have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed on behalf of the Borrower and that are held by such Lender and are not required to be issued pursuant to this Agreement.
(e) Drafts of the Borrower to be accepted as B/As hereunder shall be signed as set forth in paragraph (d) above. Notwithstanding that any Person whose signature appears on any B/A may no longer be an authorized signatory for any of the Lenders or the Borrower at the date of issuance of such B/A, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had remained in force at the time of such issuance and any such B/A so signed and properly completed shall be binding on the Borrower.
(f) Upon acceptance of a B/A by a Lender, such Lender shall purchase such B/A from the Borrower at the B/A Discount Rate for such Lender applicable to such B/A accepted by it and make available the B/A Discount Proceeds to the Administrative Agent's Payment Office on the date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available in Canadian Dollars to the Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon (Toronto time). The acceptance fee payable by the Borrower to a Lender under Section 3.01(a) in respect of each B/A accepted by such Lender shall be set off against the B/A Discount Proceeds payable by such Lender under this paragraph. Unless any applicable condition specified in Article V has not been satisfied, the
 
 
 
22
 
Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders promptly available to the Borrower by crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent (or such other account as shall have been specified by the Borrower) with the aggregate amount made available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any B/A Drawing resulting from the conversion or continuation of a B/A Drawing or Loan pursuant to Section 2.09, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to the Borrower by each Lender pursuant to this paragraph will be applied as provided in Section 2.09(e).
(g) Each Lender may at any time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all B/A's accepted and purchased by it.
(h) Each B/A accepted and purchased hereunder shall mature at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto.
(i) Subject to applicable law, the Borrower waives presentment for payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Lender in respect of a B/A accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by reason of such B/A being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Lender in its own right and the Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Lender as holder sues the Borrower on the B/A for payment of the amounts payable by the Borrower thereunder. On the last day of the Contract Period of a B/A, or such earlier date as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower shall pay the Lender that has accepted and purchased such B/A the full face amount of such B/A, and after such payment the Borrower shall have no further liability in respect of such B/A and such Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and be responsible for all payments due to third parties under, such B/A.
(j) At the option of the Borrower and any Lender, B/As under this Agreement to be accepted by that Lender may be issued in the form of depository bills for deposit with The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited pursuant to the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada). All depository bills so issued shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 2.03.
(k) If a Lender is not a chartered bank under the Bank Act (Canada) or if a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent in writing that it is otherwise unable to accept B/As, such Lender will, instead of accepting and purchasing B/As, make a Loan (a "
B/A Equivalent Loan
") to the Borrower in the amount of and for the same term as each draft that such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such Lender will provide to the Administrative Agent the B/A Discount Proceeds of such B/A Equivalent Loan for the account of the Borrower in the same manner as such Lender would have provided the B/A Discount Proceeds in respect of the draft that such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such B/A Equivalent Loan will bear interest at the same rate that would have resulted if such Lender had accepted (and been paid an acceptance fee) and purchased (on a discounted basis) a B/A for the relevant Contract Period (it being the intention of the parties that each such B/A Equivalent Loan shall have the same economic consequences for the Lenders and the Borrower as the B/A that such B/A Equivalent Loan replaces). All such interest shall be paid in advance on the date such B/A Equivalent Loan is made, and shall be deducted from the principal amount of such B/A Equivalent Loan
 
 
 
23
 
in the same manner in which the B/A Discount Proceeds of a B/A would be deducted from the face amount of the B/A. Subject to the repayment requirements of this Agreement, on the last day of the relevant Contract Period for such B/A Equivalent Loan, the Borrower shall be entitled to convert each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another type of Loan, or to roll over each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another B/A Equivalent Loan, all in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
(l) Notwithstanding any provision hereof, the Borrower may not prepay any B/A Drawing.
(m) For greater certainty, all provisions of this Agreement which are applicable to B/As shall also be applicable,
mutatis mutandis
, to B/A Equivalent Loans.
SECTION 2.04.
Repayment; Evidence of Indebtedness
. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender (i) the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date, together with all interest accrued thereon and not yet paid, and (ii) the face amount of each B/A accepted by such Lender as provided in Section 2.03(i), in each case in the currency of such Loan or B/A.
(b) Each Lender, with respect to amounts payable to it hereunder, and the Administrative Agent, with respect to all amounts payable hereunder, shall maintain on its books, in accordance with its usual practice, loan accounts setting forth each Loan and B/A accepted, the Type and currency of each Loan, the applicable interest rate, Interest Period, Contract Period and the amounts of principal, interest, amounts in respect of B/As and other sums paid and payable by the Borrower from time to time hereunder with respect thereto;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender to record any such amount on its books shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower with respect thereto. In the case of any dispute, action or proceeding relating to any amount payable hereunder, the entries in each such account shall be conclusive evidence of such amount absent manifest error.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Lender shall so request for purposes of Section 11.08(g), the obligation to repay the Loans made by it shall also be evidenced by a promissory note in the form of Exhibit 2.04(c).
SECTION 2.05.
Termination and Reduction of the Commitments
. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Effective Date.
(b) The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, upon not less than three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments or permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments by an aggregate amount of US$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof. Any reduction in the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to each Lender's Commitment in accordance with such Lender's Percentage Share.
SECTION 2.06.
Optional Prepayments
. Subject to Section 3.10, the Borrower may upon notice to the Administrative Agent, stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
 
 
 
24
 
amount of the prepayment, received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 12:00 noon (Toronto time) (x) not less than three Business Days prior to the proposed date of prepayment, in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans and (y) not less than one Business Day prior to the proposed date of prepayment, in the case of a prepayment of Reference Rate Loans and Canadian Prime Rate Loans, prepay ratably among the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of any Loans in whole or in part, together (other than in the case of a prepayment of Reference Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans prior to the Maturity Date) with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. Each such partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than US$5,000,000 or Cdn$5,000,000, as applicable, or an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 or Cdn$1,000,000, as applicable, in excess thereof;
provided
,
however
, that if the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Loans comprised in the same Borrowing shall be reduced as a result of any optional prepayment to an amount less than US$5,000,000, the Eurodollar Loans comprised in such Borrowing shall automatically convert into Reference Rate Loans at the end of the then current Interest Period. If any notice of prepayment is given, the principal amount stated therein, together (other than in the case of a prepayment of a Reference Rate Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Loan prior to the Maturity Date) with accrued interest to the date of prepayment, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such notice. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
SECTION 2.07.
Interest
. (a) Subject to Section 2.08, each Loan shall bear interest, at the option of the Borrower (i) in the case of Reference Rate Loans, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Reference Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate, (ii) in the case of Canadian Prime Rate Loans, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Canadian Prime Rate p
lus
the Applicable Rate or (iii) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBOR
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(b) Accrued and unpaid interest in respect of each Loan shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date, on the Maturity Date and (other than in the case of a Reference Rate Loan) on the date of any prepayment or repayment of such Loan.
SECTION 2.08.
Default Interest
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.07, if any principal of or interest on any Loan, any fee, or any payment required to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement in respect of any B/A or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in Section 2.07 or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% per annum plus the rate applicable to Reference Rate Loans as provided in paragraph (a)(i) of Section 2.07.
SECTION 2.09.
Continuation and Conversion Elections
. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in a Notice of Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Notice of Borrowing. Each B/A Drawing shall have a Contract Period as specified in the applicable request therefor. Following the Borrowings and B/A Drawings on the Effective Date, the Borrower may elect to convert and continue any Borrowing or B/A Drawing pursuant to an irrevocable written Notice
 
 
 
 
25
 
of Conversion/Continuation as provided in paragraph (b) below (it being understood that (i) no Borrowing or B/A Drawing may be converted to or continued as a Borrowing or B/A Drawing denominated in a different currency, (ii) no B/A Drawing may be converted or continued other than at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto, (iii) no Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing if the requested Interest Period would end after the Maturity Date and (iv) no Borrowing or B/A Drawing denominated in Canadian Dollars may be converted to a Eurodollar Borrowing and no Borrowing denominated in US Dollars may be converted to a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing). The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowings or B/A Drawings, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowings or accepting the B/As comprising such B/A Drawings, as the case may be, and any Loans or B/As resulting from an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing or B/A Drawing. The Borrower may upon irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) below:
(i) elect to convert, on any Business Day, any Reference Rate Loans (or any part thereof in an aggregate amount not less than US$5,000,000, or an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof) into Eurodollar Loans;
(ii) elect to convert, on any Business Day, any Eurodollar Loans (or any part thereof in an aggregate amount not less than US$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of US$1,000,000 in excess thereof) into Reference Rate Loans;
(iii) elect to continue, on the expiration date of any Interest Period, any Eurodollar Loans maturing on such Interest Payment Date;
(iv) elect to continue, on the expiration date of any Contract Period, any B/A Drawing maturing on such Contract Date by means of a new B/A Drawing on such Contract Date;
(v) elect to convert, on the expiration date of any Contract Period, any B/A Drawing maturing on such Contract Date into a Canadian Prime Rate Loan; or
(vi) elect to convert, on any Business Day, any Canadian Prime Rate Loans into B/As by means of a B/A Drawing on such Business Day;
provided
,
however
, that if on the expiration date of any Interest Period the aggregate amount of outstanding Eurodollar Loans comprised in the same Borrowing shall have been reduced as a result of the conversion of part thereof to an amount less than US$5,000,000, the remaining Eurodollar Loans comprised in such Borrowing shall automatically convert into Reference Rate Loans on such date and on and after such date the right of the Borrower to continue such Loans as Eurodollar Loans shall terminate.
(b) The Borrower shall deliver a notice of conversion or continuation (a "
Notice of Conversion/Continuation
"), in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.09 not later than (i) in the case of an election that will result in a Borrowing to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, Reference Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, by the times and dates that would be required under Section 2.02 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting
 
 
26
 
from such election to be made on the effective date of such election and (ii) in the case of an election that will result in a B/A Drawing, by the time and date that would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting an acceptance and purchase of B/As to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall be irrevocable and shall be by facsimile confirmed immediately by telephone specifying therein the following information:
(i) the Borrowing or B/A Drawing to which such Notice of Conversion/Continuation applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Notice of Conversion/Continuation, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether a Reference Rate Borrowing, a Eurodollar Borrowing, a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing or a B/A Drawing is elected; and
(iv) in the case of an election of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period", and in the case of an election of a B/A Drawing, the Contract Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Contract Period". If any such Notice of Conversion/Continuation requests a Eurodollar Borrowing or B/A Drawing but does not specify an Interest Period or Contract Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration or a Contract Period of 30 days duration, as the case may be.
(c) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing or B/A Drawing prior to the end of the Interest Period or Contract Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing or B/A Drawing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period or Contract Period such Borrowing or B/A Drawing shall be converted to a Reference Rate Borrowing or a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing, as applicable. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing or a B/A Drawing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing or B/A Drawing shall be converted to a Reference Rate Borrowing or a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing, as applicable, at the end of the Interest Period or Contract Period applicable thereto.
(d) Upon receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof or, if no timely notice is provided, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion. Each conversion and continuation shall be made
pro
rata
among the Lenders based on the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans or B/As of each Lender included in the Borrowing or B/A Drawing with respect to which such notice was given.
 
 
 
27
 
 
(e) Upon the conversion of any Borrowing or the continuation of any B/A Drawing (or portion thereof) to or as a B/A Drawing, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to the Borrower by each Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(f) in respect of such new B/A Drawing shall be applied against the principal of the Loan made by such Lender (in the case of a conversion), or the Borrower's obligation to reimburse such Lender in respect of the B/As accepted by such Lender under Section 2.03(i) (in the case of a continuation) as part of such converted Borrowing or such continued B/A Drawing, and the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender on the date of such conversion or continuation an amount equal to the difference between the principal amount of such Loan or the aggregate face amount of such maturing B/As, as the case may be, and such net amount. Upon the conversion of any B/A Drawing (or portion thereof) to a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to have made a Canadian Prime Rate Loan to the Borrower on the date of such conversion in an amount equal to the face amount of the maturing B/A of such Lender, and the proceeds of such Canadian Prime Rate Loan shall be deemed to have been applied to satisfy the Borrower's obligation to reimburse such Lender in respect of the B/As accepted by such Lender as part of such B/A Drawing under Section 2.03(i).
(f) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of any Borrowing or B/A Drawing, there shall not be more than an aggregate amount of fifteen (i) Interest Periods in effect in respect of all Loans outstanding at such time and (ii) Contract Periods in effect in respect of all B/As outstanding at such time.
ARTICLE III
 
Fees; Payments; Taxes; Changes in Circumstances
SECTION 3.01.
Fees
. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, on each date on which B/As are accepted hereunder, an acceptance fee in Canadian Dollars computed by multiplying (i) the product of the face amount of each B/A accepted by such Lender and the Applicable Rate by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Contract Period applicable to such B/A and the denominator of which is 365.
(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the Administrative Agent's own account, fees in the amount and at the times set forth in the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter.
(c) All fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders. Once paid, none of the fees shall be refundable under any circumstances;
provided
,
however
, that the foregoing shall in no event constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect any claims the Borrower may have against any other party to this Agreement.
SECTION 3.02.
Computation of Fees and Interest
. (a) All computations of acceptance fees payable in respect of B/As and interest payable in respect of Reference Rate Loans and Canadian Prime Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days or 366
 
 
 
28
 
days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed. Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which such interest or fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.
SECTION 3.03.
Payments by the Borrower
. (a) All payments (including prepayments and payments of principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any amount in respect of any B/A Drawing or any fees or other amounts) to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall, except as expressly provided herein, be made to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders at the Administrative Agent's Payment Office, in US Dollars, in the case of Eurodollar Loans or Reference Rate Loans, or in Canadian Dollars, in the case of Canadian Prime Rate Loans or B/A Drawings, and in immediately available funds, not later than 12:00 noon (Toronto time) on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly after receiving any payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts from the Borrower, in the case of payments for the accounts of the Lenders, distribute to each Lender its Percentage Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such payment for the account of its respective Lending Office and, in the case of each other payment received by it for the account of any other Person, distribute such payment to the appropriate recipient. Any payment which is received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00 noon (Toronto time) shall be deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day.
(b) Whenever any payment of a Loan shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest and fees, as the case may be;
provided
,
however
, that if such extension would cause any payment of principal of or interest on Eurodollar Loans to be made in the next calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, the excess of the amount distributed to such Lender over the amount, if any, paid by the Borrower, together with interest thereon at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender to the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent.
 
 
 
29
 
 
SECTION 3.04.
Payments by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent
.
(a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Effective Date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower the amount of such Lender's Percentage Share of any Borrowing or B/A Drawing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of such Borrowing or B/A Drawing and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such full amount available to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances makes available to the Borrower such amount, such Lender shall, within two Business Days following the date of such Borrowing or B/A Drawing, make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate (in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or Reference Rate Loan) or the CDOR Rate (in the case of any Canadian Prime Rate Loan or B/A Drawing) and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation for and determined as of each day during such period. If such amount is so made available, such payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Lender's Loan or payment in respect of the applicable B/As for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent within two Business Days following the date of such Borrowing or B/A Drawing, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of such failure to fund and, on the third Business Day following the date of such Borrowing or B/A Drawing, the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing or B/A Drawing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing or the sum of the B/A Discount Rate and the acceptance fee applicable to the B/As of such Lender included in such B/A Drawing. Nothing contained in this Section 3.04(a) shall relieve any Lender which has failed to make available its Percentage Share of any Borrowing or B/A Drawing hereunder from its obligation to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.
(b) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on the date of any Borrowing or to accept and purchase any B/A required to be accepted and purchased by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make a Loan on the date of such Borrowing or accept any B/A pursuant to the provisions contained herein, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan or accept any B/A to be made or accepted by such other Lender.
SECTION 3.05.
Taxes.
(a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that if any Loan Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent and each Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
 
 
30
 
 
(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authorities in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Loan Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any Obligation of either Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. After the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, receives written notice from a relevant taxing authority of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes subject to the provisions of Section 3.05, such party will act in good faith to promptly notify the Borrower of its obligations hereunder.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Loan Party is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, each such Lender agrees that it will deliver upon the Borrower's request updated versions of the foregoing documents whenever they become obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, together with such other forms or documents as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to continued exemption from or reduction of withholding tax;
provided
however, that no Lender shall be required to provide any documents or forms which it cannot deliver under applicable law because such Lender is no longer entitled to an exemption of withholding tax due to a change in applicable law. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation to the Borrower. If a Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party did not properly withhold an Indemnified Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (but only to the extent such claim arises because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed, because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in its circumstances (other than a change in law) which rendered an exemption from withholding tax ineffective or because of such Lender's sale of a participating interest in a Loan), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and/or any Loan Party, as applicable, fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative
 
 
 
31
 
Agent and/or any Loan Party, as Tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest together with all costs, expenses and attorney's fees (including the allocated cost of in-house counsel). Each Lender represents and warrants that, as of the time that any amount is first paid or credited to or by such Lender on account of the Obligations, it will be a Canadian Resident Lender;
provided
that no such representation or warranty is made or will be deemed made at such time to the extent that such Lender fails or is unable to qualify as a Canadian Resident Lender as a result of any Change in Law after the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement.
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.05, it shall pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.05 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
, that the Loan Parties agree, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, to repay the amount paid over to them (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent or such Lender in the event such Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
SECTION 3.06.
Sharing of Payments, Etc.
If other than as provided in Section 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10 or 3.11, any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Loan made by it or B/A accepted by it or, after acceleration of all Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02(b), in respect of any Obligation owing to it, in the case of the Loan or B/A, in excess of its Percentage Share of all payments on account of the Loans and B/As received by all the Lenders and, after acceleration, in excess of its
pro
rata
share of all Obligations, such Lender shall forthwith (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made, or B/As accepted, by them or, after acceleration, in all Obligations owing to them, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of the other Lenders according to their respective Percentage Shares or, after acceleration, their
pro
rata
shares of all the Obligations;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to the extent of such recovery be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price thereof together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.06 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records
 
 
32
 
(which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error), of participations purchased pursuant to this Section 3.06 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases.
SECTION 3.07.
Inadequacy of LIBOR
. If with respect to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Loans, the Administrative Agent shall determine, or the Majority Lenders shall notify the Administrative Agent, that LIBOR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period (after giving effect to any event giving rise to additional interest on such Loans pursuant to Section 3.11), the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon the obligations of the Lenders to make or continue Loans as Eurodollar Loans or to convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans at the end of the then current Interest Period shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke its Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the Borrower does not revoke such notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Reference Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Loans.
SECTION 3.08.
Increased Costs
. If any Lender shall determine that, due to either (a) the introduction of any Requirement of Law or any change (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation thereof or (b) the compliance with any guideline or request from made after the date hereof by any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Loan or obtaining funds for the purchase of B/As or maintaining its obligation to accept and purchase B/As, respectively, the Borrower shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs (other than costs for Taxes contemplated by Section 3.05 and reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.06).
SECTION 3.09.
Capital Adequacy
. If any Lender shall have determined that the introduction of or change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy, including any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof or, any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority, or the compliance therewith by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and such Lender (taking into consideration such Lender's, or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of such Lender's Commitment, loans or obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Borrowing or B/As, respectively, then from time to time, upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall be liable for, and shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
 
 
 
33
 
account of such Lender, as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increase.
SECTION 3.10.
Funding Losses
. The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of:
(a) any failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Eurodollar Loan or to issue B/As for acceptance and purchase after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation;
(b) any prepayment or payment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto;
(c) any failure of the Borrower to make any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.06;
(d) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to a Reference Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the respective Interest Period pursuant to Section 2.09; or
(e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or right to receive payment in respect of any B/A other than on the last day of the Interest Period or Contract Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.13;
including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Loans or to purchase B/As hereunder or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
SECTION 3.11.
Additional Interest on Eurodollar Loans
. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, at the request of such Lender (but not more frequently than once in each calendar quarter), as long as such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender from the date such Eurodollar Loan is made until such principal amount is paid in full, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (a) LIBOR for the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan from (b) the rate obtained by dividing such LIBOR by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date interest in respect of such Eurodollar Loan is payable. Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous sentence, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay to any Lender any additional interest in respect of Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender for any period commencing more than three months prior to the date on which such Lender notifies the Borrower by delivering a certificate from a financial officer of such Lender, that such Lender is required to maintain reserves with respect to Eurocurrency Liabilities.
SECTION 3.12.
Certificates of Lenders
. Any Lender claiming reimbursement or compensation pursuant to Section 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10 and/or 3.11 shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for computing the amount payable to such Lender hereunder and such certificate shall be
 
 
34
 
conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the Borrower shall pay to any Lender claiming compensation or reimbursement from the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.08, 3.09, 3.10 or 3.11, the amount requested by such Lender no later than five Business Days after such demand.
SECTION 3.13.
Change of Lending Office; Replacement Lender
. (a) Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.05(a) or (c) or Sections 3.08, 3.09 or 3.11 with respect to such Lender, it will if so requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section;
provided
,
however
, that such designation would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Nothing in this Section 3.13 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 3.05(a) or (c) or Section 3.08, 3.09 or 3.11.
(b) In the event the Borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts to any Lender pursuant to Sections 3.05(a) or (c), 3.08, 3.09 or 3.11 as a result of any condition described in any such Section, then, unless such Lender has theretofore taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured, the conditions creating the cause for such obligation to pay such additional amounts, the Borrower may designate another Lender which is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (such Lender being herein called a "
Replacement Lender
") to purchase the Loans of such Lender and such Lender's rights and obligations in respect of accepted B/As and such Lender's rights hereunder, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender for a purchase price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans payable to such Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans, Obligations in respect of such B/As and accrued but unpaid fees in respect of such Lender's Commitment and any other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, and to assume all the obligations of such Lender hereunder (except for such rights as survive repayment of the Loans), and, upon such purchase, such Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights hereunder (except those related to any Bid Loans of such Lender which remain outstanding and those that survive full payment hereunder) and shall be relieved from all obligations to the Borrower hereunder, and the Replacement Lender shall succeed to the rights and obligations of such Lender hereunder;
provided
that, if the Borrower elects to exercise such rights pursuant to this Section 3.13 with respect to any Lender that has made a request for compensation pursuant to Section 3.11, it shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made similar requests for compensation pursuant to Section 3.11.

ARTICLE X
 
Guarantee
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrower under improved terms hereunder, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the Borrower. The Guarantor further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; (e) any change in the corporate existence or structure of the Borrower, or (f) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Guarantor to subrogation.
The Guarantor further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in favor of the Borrower or any other Person.
The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
 
 
 
60
 
 
The Guarantor further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against the Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Requirement of Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other similar event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable exchange rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
Upon payment by the Guarantor of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Guarantor against the Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Guarantor hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.

SECTION 11.03.
No Waiver; Remedies

(b) The Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, each Documentation Agent and each Lender agree that in the event that any investigation, litigation, suit, action or proceeding is asserted or threatened in writing or instituted against it or any other Indemnified Party, or any remedial, removal or response action is requested of it or any other Indemnified Party, for which the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent or any Lender may desire indemnity or defense hereunder, the Administrative Agent, the
 
 
 
63
 
Syndication Agent, such Documentation Agent or such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section; and

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaires (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Guarantor or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
 
 
 
66
 
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 11.02 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.05, 3.06, 3.08, 3.09 and 3.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.06 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.06 as though it were a Lender. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (a) has purchased a participation in the minimum amount of US$10,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent ("
Voting Participant Notification
"), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a "
Voting Participant
") and (c) receives the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an Assignee as set forth in Exhibit 11.08 hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation purchased. The Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph.
(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.05, 3.08, 3.09 or 3.10 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.05 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.05(f) as though it were a Lender. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.05 unless such Participant would qualify as a Canadian Resident Lender if it were a Lender at the time any amount is first paid or credited to or by such participant on account of the Obligations;
provided
that such Participant will be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.05 if it is unable to qualify as a Canadian Resident Lender as the result of any Change in Law;
provided
that for purposes of this paragraph (f), references in the defined term "Change in Law" to the "date of this Agreement" shall be deemed to be references to the "effective date of the sale of the participation to such Participant".
(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender to (i) a
 
 
67
 
Federal Reserve Bank or (ii) the Farm Credit Funding Corp. or to any other entity organized under the Farm Credit Act, as amended, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION 11.09.
Confidentiality
. The Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all non-public information provided to it by the Borrower or the Guarantor or on the Borrower's or the Guarantor's behalf in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except that such information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel and other advisors and other agents who in each case have a need to know such information in connection with the Transactions or the provision of other financial products or services to the Borrower or the Guarantor (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the disclosing party, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those contained in this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or the Guarantor or (h) to the extent such information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or any similar confidentiality undertaking by which the disclosing part is bound or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or the Guarantor. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
SECTION 11.10.
Survival
. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10, 3.11, 11.04, 11.05 and 11.17 (and the Guarantor's guarantee of the Borrower's Obligations under such Sections pursuant to Article X ), and the obligations of the Lenders under Sections 3.05(f) and 9.07, shall in each case survive repayment or purchase of the Loans and amounts in respect of accepted B/As or any termination of this Agreement and the Commitments. The representations and warranties made by the Borrower and the Guarantor in this Agreement and in each other Loan Document shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and each other Loan Document.

THIS AGREEMENT EMBODIES THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING AMONG THE BORROWER, THE GUARANTOR, THE LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND SUPERSEDES ALL PRIOR AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS OF SUCH PERSONS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF EXCEPT FOR THE FEE LETTER AND ANY PRIOR ARRANGEMENTS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE PAYMENT BY THE BORROWER OR THE GUARANTOR OF (OR ANY INDEMNIFICATION FOR) ANY FEES, COSTS OR EXPENSES PAYABLE TO OR INCURRED (OR TO BE INCURRED) BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE LENDERS.

SECTION 11.17.
Conversion of Currencies.
(a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
(b) The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "
Applicable Creditor
") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "
Judgment Currency
") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the "
Agreement Currency
"), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss, and if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Applicable Creditor shall refund the amount of such excess to the Borrower.
SECTION 11.18.

Interest Act

Whenever interest is calculated on the basis of a year of 360 or 365 days, for the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest which is equivalent to the rate payable hereunder is the rate payable multiplied by the actual number of days in the year and divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be. All interest will be calculated using the nominal rate method and not the effective rate method and the deemed reinvestment principle shall not apply to such calculations.
