Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On November 14, 2005, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending October 1, 2005. The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Company's press release and conference call relating to the press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements.
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, dispositions of assets or investments, BSE-related charges, litigation settlements, natural disaster related charges, non-recurring income tax adjustments and other similar events. The Company's management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Limitation on Incorporation by Reference
In accordance with general instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report, including exhibits, is furnished pursuant to Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.

TYSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND
FISCAL YEAR 2005 RESULTS
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  November 14, 2005 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported $0.28 diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2005, compared to $0.19 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2005 sales were $6.5 billion compared to $7.1 billion for the same period last year. Operating income was $190 million compared to $178 million and net income was $98 million compared to $66 million for the same period last year.
 
The Company's accounting cycle resulted in a 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week year in fiscal 2005, as compared to a 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week year in fiscal 2004.
 
Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 included a non-recurring income tax net benefit of $15 million. The net benefit includes the reversal of tax reserves, partially offset by an income tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign income.
    
Additionally, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 included $8 million of pretax losses related to Hurricane Katrina. Combined, these items increased diluted earnings per share by $0.03. The Company anticipates additional Hurricane Katrina related costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
 
Pretax earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included costs of $46 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, related to fixed asset write-downs and intangible asset impairments.
 
Diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2005 were $0.99 compared to $1.13 in the same period last year. Sales for fiscal year 2005 were $26.0 billion compared to $26.4 billion for the same period last year. Operating income for fiscal year 2005 was $765 million compared to $925 million and net income was $353 million compared to $403 million for the same period last year.
 
Pretax earnings for fiscal year 2005 included $33 million of costs related to a legal settlement involving the Company's live swine operations, $14 million of costs for plant closings, $8 million of losses related to Hurricane Katrina, $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Company's remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. Additionally, earnings included a non-recurring income tax net benefit of $15 million. Combined, these items decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.02.
 
Pretax earnings for fiscal year 2004 included $40 million of costs for plant closings, $61 million of BSE-related charges and $46 million of fixed asset write-downs and intangible asset impairments. Combined, these items decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.26.
 
"I am proud of the way our people executed our business strategy during the challenging circumstances we faced in fiscal 2005," John Tyson, chairman and CEO, said. "Our cash flow remains strong, and our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 39.2%, surpassing our goal of 40% for fiscal 2005. Our chicken business performed well, and our pork business improved in the fourth quarter. However, with export markets closed throughout the year and Canadian import issues, our beef business was difficult.
 
"We are encouraged by recent developments in export market access, but fiscal 2006 will present only gradual recovery in beef as those markets begin to open and cattle supplies improve. As domestic hog supplies continue to improve, the pork segment should generate more normal returns. We expect our chicken business to remain solid, and our Prepared Foods' segment market share to improve."

Chicken (32.1% of Net Sales, 72.1% of Total Operating Income  4th Quarter 2005)
Chicken segment sales decreased 9.6% and 0.8% in the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales declines were primarily due to lower volumes, caused largely by one less week of sales, partially offset by higher average sales prices and improved product mix.
Chicken segment operating income increased $39 million and $34 million in the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2005, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. Excluding fiscal 2005 charges of $12 million related to plant closing accruals and $8 million of hurricane losses, and fiscal 2004 charges of $13 million related to fixed asset write-downs and $13 million of plant closing related accruals, operating income increased $28 million. Operating income for the 12 months of fiscal 2005 was positively impacted by decreased grain costs of $312 million. However, the current year benefits from decreased grain costs were partially offset by the effect of the Company realizing a loss of $27 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to a gain of $127 million in fiscal 2004 from the Company's commodity risk management activities. Additionally, fiscal 2005 operating income was negatively impacted by higher energy costs.
Beef (45.4% of Net Sales, (6.8)% of Total Operating Income  4th Quarter 2005)
Beef segment sales decreased 6.4% and 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales declines primarily resulted from the effects of import and export restrictions. Those restrictions contributed to lower international sales volumes and lower average domestic sales prices due in part to the mix of products allowed for export. Additionally the current year had one less week of sales.
Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 decreased $58 million as compared to the same period last year, excluding $5 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 related to fixed asset write-downs and intangible asset impairments. Operating income was negatively impacted by decreased volumes and margins at the Company's Lakeside operation in Canada.
Fiscal 2005 operating income decreased $215 million as compared to the prior year, excluding $10 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation in fiscal 2005, prior year BSE-related charges of $61 million and $5 million of charges related to fixed asset write-downs and intangible asset impairments recorded in fiscal 2004. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower domestic cattle supplies and restrictions on imports of Canadian cattle for most of the year which resulted in lower production volumes and raised the operating cost per head. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by decreased volumes and margins at the Company's Lakeside operation in Canada.

Pork (11.7% of Net Sales, 16.8% of Total Operating Income  4th Quarter 2005)
Pork segment sales decreased 14.2% and increased 1.9% for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Sales declines in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were primarily due to decreased sales volumes, lower average domestic sales prices and one less week of sales.
    
Sales increases for the 12 months of fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from higher average sales prices, both domestically and internationally, as compared to the same period last year. The higher average sales prices, driven primarily by higher average live hog prices, were partially offset by a decrease in volumes, caused largely by one less week of sales.
Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 increased $8 million as compared to the same period last year, excluding $1 million of charges related to fixed asset write-downs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower average live hog prices.
Fiscal 2005 operating income decreased $63 million as compared to the prior year, excluding current year costs of $33 million related to a legal settlement involving the Company's live swine operations, $2 million received in fiscal 2005 in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and $1 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2004 related to fixed asset write-downs. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher average live hog prices and lower volumes, which increased the operating cost per head and more than offset the increase in average sales prices.
Prepared Foods (10.5% of Net Sales, 9.5% of Total Operating Income  4th Quarter 2005)
(10.8% of Net Sales, 10.2% of Total Operating Income  12 Months 2005)
 
Prepared Foods segment sales decreased 14.1% and 3.1% for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Fourth quarter fiscal 2005 sales declines were primarily due to lower average sales prices, the rationalization of lower margin product lines and decreased sales volumes, caused largely by one less week of sales. Decreased sales volumes for the 12 months of fiscal 2005 were partially offset by higher average sales prices.
 
Fiscal 2005 operating income decreased $2 million as compared to the prior year, excluding plant closing related accruals of $2 million and $27 million recorded in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, and excluding $27 million of fixed asset write-downs and intangible asset impairments recorded in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the Prepared Foods segment's operating income was primarily due to increased raw material prices.
