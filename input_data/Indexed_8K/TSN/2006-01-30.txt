Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On January 30, 2006, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the first quarter ending December 31, 2005, as well as an announcement that it will amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2005. The amendment relates to the restatement of the Company's financial statements for the year ended October 1, 2005, to correct the income tax treatment of an actuarial gain resulting from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
The Company's press release regarding its first quarter results and conference call relating thereto includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, dispositions of assets or investments, BSE-related charges, litigation settlements, natural disaster related charges, non-recurring income tax adjustments and other similar events. The Company's management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Limitation on Incorporation by Reference
 
The information disclosed in this report pursuant to Item 2.02, including the exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
Item 4.02(a). Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
 
On January 27, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Audit Committee") concluded, based upon the recommendation of the Company's management, that the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005, be amended and restated to reflect a reduction to income tax expense associated with the tax treatment of an actuarial gain resulting from the Medical Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
 
Based on the error, the previously issued financial statements for the year ended October 1, 2005, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2005, and the related report of independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, should no longer be relied upon. The Company's management and Audit Committee have consulted with Ernst & Young LLP as to the matters disclosed pursuant to this Item 4.02(a).

TYSON REPORTS FIRST QUARTER
FISCAL 2006 AND RESTATED FISCAL 2005 RESULTS
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  January 30, 2006 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported $0.11 diluted earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.14 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Sales for the first quarter of fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were both $6.5 billion. Operating income was $114 million compared to $129 million and net income was $39 million compared to $48 million for the same period last year.
 
Pretax earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 included $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation, a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Company's remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. and $3 million of costs related to a prepared foods plant closing. The combined effect increased diluted earnings per share by $0.03.
 
John Tyson, chairman and CEO, said, "We entered fiscal 2006 knowing market conditions would be difficult, especially early in the year. During the first quarter our Chicken segment generated solid results and Prepared Foods improved, while Pork struggled and Beef further deteriorated, producing significant operating losses. Recent declines in international demand for chicken coupled with greater than expected domestic supply will dramatically impact the projected performance of our Chicken segment. Lower than projected cattle supplies, along with unanticipated interruptions in export market access, will slow the recovery that we expected for Beef later in the year. The cumulative effect of these factors has caused us to project a net loss for the second quarter and we now expect our fiscal 2006 earnings to range from $0.50 to $0.80 per diluted share. However, we will continue to face these challenges head on and remain focused on managing our business efficiently and executing our long-term strategic plans."
 
The Company also today announced it will amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005, which will be filed in February 2006 and will result in an increase to net income of $19 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The amendment relates to the restatement of the Company's financial statements for the year ended October 1, 2005, to correct the tax treatment associated with a non-recurring actuarial gain the Company recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The actuarial gain resulted from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). The Act allows for a possible subsidy to retirement health plan sponsors to help offset the costs of participant prescription drug benefits. In March 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Act." In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company concluded the prescription drug benefits included in its postretirement medical plan were actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D under the Act. Included in a net actuarial loss of approximately $9 million related to the Company's post-retirement health plan and in accordance with FASB Staff Position 106-2, the Company decreased its accumulated postretirement obligation and recognized an actuarial gain of approximately $55 million related to the present value of all future subsidies expected to be received for benefits earned. FASB Staff Position 106-2 states that "In the periods in which the subsidy affects the employer's accounting for the plan, it shall have no effect on any plan-related temporary difference accounted for under FASB Statement 109 because the subsidy is exempt from federal taxation." However, the Company recorded income tax expense related to the actuarial gain of approximately $19 million, resulting in a $0.05 reduction to diluted earnings per share. Accordingly, this restatement will result in the reporting of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting in the Company's amended 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Restated earnings for fiscal 2005 were $372 million or $1.04 per diluted share, compared to $403 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. Restated pretax earnings for fiscal 2005 included $33 million of costs related to a legal settlement involving the Company's live swine operations, $14 million of costs for plant closing, $8 million of losses related to Hurricane Katrina, $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Company's remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. Additionally, earnings included a non-recurring income tax net benefit of $15 million. That includes the reversal of tax reserves, partially offset by an income tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign income. Also, in fiscal 2005 the Company recognized a tax-exempt actuarial gain of $55 million, for which the Company erroneously recorded income tax expense of $19 million. The Company's restated fiscal 2005 results reduce the income tax provision accordingly. Combined, these items increased fiscal 2005 restated diluted earnings per share by $0.03.
 
John Tyson, chairman and CEO, said, "The restatement relates to the tax treatment of a one-time non recurring actuarial gain. Additionally the restatement does not impact the Company's previously issued revenue, income before taxes, or cash flows from operations; nor were the Company's segment operating results impacted by the restatement."

Page 3 of 11
Chicken (31.5% of Net Sales, 107.9% of Total Operating Income  1st Quarter 2006)
First quarter fiscal 2006 operating income increased $19 million as compared to the same period last year. Operating income was positively impacted by decreased grain costs of approximately $14 million as compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the impact resulting from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases was less than $1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, as compared to a loss of $23 million recorded in the same period last year. First quarter fiscal 2006 operating income was negatively impacted by decreased margins at the Company's operations in Mexico and higher energy costs. Chicken segment sales decreased 1.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period last year. The decrease in sales was due to lower average sales prices.
 
Beef (45.2% of Net Sales, (56.1)% of Total Operating Income  1st Quarter 2006)
First quarter fiscal 2006 operating income decreased $38 million, excluding $10 million received in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. The decrease in operating income was due primarily to decreased volumes and margins at the Company's Lakeside operation in Canada due in part to the labor strike occurring in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by higher operating costs per head. Beef segment sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period last year. The increase in sales was due primarily to higher average sales prices of approximately 4.0%. Sales and operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, were negatively impacted by $3 million and $14 million, respectively, from net losses related to open mark-to-market futures positions from the Company's on-going commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef sales.
          
 
Pork (12.3% of Net Sales, 9.6% of Total Operating Income  1st Quarter 2006)
First quarter fiscal 2006 operating income decreased $2 million, excluding $2 million received in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Operating income was negatively impacted by decreased average sales prices and higher operating costs per head, partially offset by lower live costs and increased sales volumes. Pork segment sales decreased 6.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period last year. The decrease in sales was due primarily to lower average sales prices, partially offset by increased sales volumes.
               
 
Prepared Foods (10.7% of Net Sales, 21.1% of Total Operating Income  1st Quarter 2006)
First quarter fiscal 2006 operating income increased $9 million as compared to the same period last year, excluding plant closing related accruals of $3 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase in operating income was due primarily to decreased raw material costs and product mix improvements. Prepared Foods segment sales decreased 5.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period last year. The decrease in sales was due primarily to lower average sales prices and decreased sales volumes, partially due to the rationalization of lower margin product lines.
