Incorporated
As Representative of the several Underwriters

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Tyson Foods, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch") and each of the other Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), for whom Merrill Lynch is acting as Representative (in such capacity, the "Representative"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective principal amounts set forth in such Schedule A of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.6% Notes due 2016 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 1, 1995, as supplemented, (hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A , as trustee (the "Trustee").
The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representative deems advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act").
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-53171) (including the exhibits and any schedules thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "First Registration Statement") for the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), of the debt securities of the Company, including the Securities, and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). The First Registration Statement was declared effective by the Commission on June 1, 1998. The Company has also filed with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-132434), including the related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses (including the exhibits and any schedules thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "Second Registration Statement" and, together with the First Registration Statement, the "Registration Statements" and each a "Registration Statement"). The Second Registration Statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the 1933 Act Regulations. The Company also has filed with the Commission a preliminary prospectus supplement, specifically relating to the Securities, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act
 
Regulations ("Rule 424(b)"). Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a final prospectus supplement, specifically relating to the Securities, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations. Any information included in such prospectus supplement that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information." Each prospectus or prospectus supplement used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a "preliminary prospectus." The basic prospectus included in the First Registration Statement and the basic prospectus included in the Second Registration Statement, each relating to all offerings of securities registered under such Registration Statement, are herein referred to together as the "Base Prospectuses" and each a "Base Prospectus." The Base Prospectuses together with the final prospectus supplement in the form first furnished to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement and any preliminary prospectuses that form a part thereof, is herein called the "Prospectus." For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statements, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in either Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in either Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to either Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in either Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

Neither the Prospectus nor any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement was issued and at the Closing Time, included or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Each preliminary prospectus (including the prospectuses filed as part of the Registration Statements or any amendments thereto) complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act Regulations and each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with this offering was identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T and except for filing fees information.

As of the time of the filing of the Final Term Sheet, the General Disclosure Package, when considered together with the Final Term Sheet (as defined in Section 3(b)), will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(k) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representative, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representative, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that prior to the preparation of the Final Term Sheet in accordance with Section 3(b), the Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors.

Indemnification
(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (each, an "Affiliate"), its selling agents and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company;
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Merrill Lynch), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in either Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
(b) . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed either Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in either Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Merrill Lynch, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a) (ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
 
equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed either Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company, and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

(b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in either Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
As counsel for Tyson Foods, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), we address this letter to you individually and as the representative of the several Underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement dated March [], 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among you, as representative of the Underwriters, and the Company, with respect to the issuance and sale pursuant thereto of $[] aggregate principal amount of the Company's []% Notes Due 20[] (the "Notes"). The Notes are being issued under the Indenture dated as of June 1, 1995 (the "Indenture") between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee").
    
            
            
    
The Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"):
(i) on May 20, 1998, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-53171), which registration statement became effective on June 1, 1998; as used in this letter, the term "First Registration Statement" shall mean, as of any time referred to herein, such registration statement, as amended at such time, including, except as otherwise specified herein, the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at such time and any information included in the Prospectus (as defined below) that was omitted from the First Registration Statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in the First Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(1) under the 1933 Act;
(ii) on March 15, 2006, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-132434), which registration statement became effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the 1933 Act; as used in this letter, the term "Second Registration Statement" shall mean, as of any time referred to herein, such registration statement, as amended at such time, including, except as otherwise specified herein, the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated

(iii) on March 15, 2006 pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, the Company's preliminary prospectus supplement dated March 15, 2006 (the "First Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the prospectus dated June 1, 1998 included in the First Registration Statement and the prospectus dated March 15, 2006 included in the Second Registration Statement (together, the "Base Prospectus"); as used in this letter, the term "First Preliminary Prospectus" shall mean the Base Prospectus and the First Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, including the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act.
(iv) on March 16, 2006 pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, the Company's preliminary prospectus supplement dated March 16, 2006 (the "Second Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Base Prospectus; as used in this letter, the term "Second Preliminary Prospectus" shall mean the Base Prospectus and the Second Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, including the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act.
(v) on March [], 2006 pursuant to Rule 433 under the 1933 Act, a final term sheet, dated March [], 2006 (the "Final Term Sheet"), relating to the Notes; and

The Prospectus is the most recent form of prospectus relating to the Notes filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act.
    
    
Pursuant to the requirement of Section 5(b)(i) of the Underwriting Agreement, this will advise you that in the opinion of the undersigned:
1. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
2. The Indenture has been duly authorized, qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
3. The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, when executed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the
 
Indenture and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with the terms of the Notes, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
4. Each Registration Statement has become effective under the 1933 Act; the Prospectus has been filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act; the Final Term Sheet has been filed pursuant to Rule 433 under the 1933 Act in accordance with Rule 433 under the 1933 Act; and, to our knowledge (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of either Registration Statement has been issued and (ii) no proceeding for such purpose has been instituted or is pending or threatened by the Commission.
5. At the time each Registration Statement became effective and at the date of the Prospectus, each Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting schedules included therein, and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1"), as to which we express no opinion) complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
6. The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the headings "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes" (insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Notes and the Indenture) fairly summarize in all material respects the matters therein described.
7. To our knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental or regulatory authority or agency is required under Applicable Laws for the execution and delivery by the Company of, or the performance of the Company's obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture. As used herein, the term "Applicable Laws" means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America which, in our experience and without independent investigation, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture (provided that the term "Applicable Laws" shall not include federal or state securities or blue sky laws, including, without limitation, the 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the 1939 Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), and the respective rules and regulations thereunder).
8. The Company is not, and after receipt of payment for the Notes and application of the proceeds as described in the Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an "investment company" within the meaning of the 1940 Act.
In acting as counsel for the Company in connection with the transactions described in the first paragraph above, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, including its independent public accountants, representatives of the Underwriter and representatives of counsel for the Underwriter, at which conferences the contents of the Second Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package (as such term is defined in Annex A hereto), the First Preliminary Prospectus, the Second Preliminary Prospectus and the
 
Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although we are not passing upon or assuming responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements included or incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statements, the General Disclosure Package, the First Preliminary Prospectus, the Second Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except as set forth in paragraph 6 above), no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that:
(a) the Second Registration Statement, at the time it originally became effective under the 1933 Act or as of each "new effective date" with respect to the Notes pursuant to, and within the meaning of, Rule 430(B)(f)(2) under the 1933 Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
(b) the General Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time (as such term is defined in the Underwriting Agreement), included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
(c) the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and on the date hereof, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
except in each case we express no belief, and make no statement with respect to, the financial statements, financial data, statistical data and supporting schedules included or incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, or the Form T-1.
Insofar as the statements set forth in paragraphs 5 and (a) above address the Second Registration Statement at a "new effective date" with respect to the Notes:
(i) we have been informed by you, as representative of the Underwriters that the date of first use of the First Preliminary Prospectus was March 15, 2006 and that such use occurred prior to the date and time of the first contract of sale of the Notes for the purposes of Rule 430B(f)(1) under the 1933 Act; and, therefore, we assume that a "new effective date" was March 15, 2006, and we have assumed, with your permission and without independent investigation or verification, the accuracy of such information;
(ii) we have been informed by you, as representative of the Underwriters that the date of first use of the Second Preliminary Prospectus was March 16, 2006 and that such use occurred prior to the date and time of the first contract of sale of the Notes for the purposes of Rule 430B(f)(1) under the 1933 Act; and, therefore, we assume that a "new effective date" was March 16, 2006, and we have assumed, with your permission and without independent investigation or verification, the accuracy of such information; and
(iii) we have been informed by you, as representative of the Underwriters that the Applicable Time was immediately prior to the earlier of the date that the Prospectus was first used or the date and time of the first contract of sale of the Notes for the purposes of Rule 430B(f)(1) under the 1933 Act; and, therefore, we assume that a "new effective date" was the Applicable Time, and we have assumed, with your permission and without independent investigation or verification, the accuracy of such information.
 
For the purpose of rendering the foregoing opinions and making the foregoing statements, we have relied to the extent we have deemed appropriate, as to various questions of fact material to such opinions and statements, upon the representations made by the Company in the Underwriting Agreement and upon certificates of officers of the Company. We also have examined originals, or copies of originals certified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and other statements of governmental officials and other instruments, have examined such questions of law and have satisfied ourselves as to such matters of fact as we have considered relevant and necessary as a basis for this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission or which we obtained from the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System. With respect to any instrument or agreement executed or to be executed by any party other than the Company, we have assumed, to the extent relevant to the opinions set forth herein, that (i) such party (if not a natural person) has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (ii) such party has full right, power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each instrument or agreement to which it is a party and each such instrument or agreement has been duly authorized (if applicable), executed and delivered by, and, with respect to any party other than the Company, is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement or obligation, as the case may be, of, such party.
In rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph 8 above, we have relied exclusively, as to all factual matters, on the certificate, dated as of the date of this letter (the "ICA Opinion Certificate"), of [], [] of the Company (the "Executing Officer"). We note that, for purposes of determining whether a particular entity is an investment company under the 1940 Act, it is necessary to determine whether such entity falls within the definition of "investment company" contained in Section 3(a) of the 1940 Act. That determination, in turn, rests on an examination of the "value" of the assets of such entity within the meaning of Section 2(a)(41)(A) of the 1940 Act. Section 2(a)(41)(A)(ii) of the 1940 Act provides that the "value" of certain assets held by an entity shall be the "fair value" of such assets as determined in good faith by such entity's board of directors (or similar governing body). Although the ICA Opinion Certificate makes certain certifications regarding the value of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, the Executing Officer did not request the Board of Directors of the Company or of any such subsidiary to determine the value of any assets required to be valued at "fair value" pursuant to Section 2(a)(41)(A)(ii), but obtained values from other sources the Executing Officer deemed to be reliable. We have assumed that all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries that are required to be valued at "fair value" pursuant to Section 2(a)(41)(A)(ii) of the 1940 Act by the Board of Directors of the Company would have been valued at the same values ascribed to such assets in connection with the execution of the ICA Opinion Certificate had the Board of Directors of the Company or of the relevant subsidiary determined the "fair value" thereof pursuant to said section.
                    
                    
Any opinion or statement herein which is expressed to be "to our knowledge" or is otherwise qualified by words of like import means that the lawyers currently practicing law with
 
the Firm who have had active involvement in representing the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have no current conscious awareness of any facts or information contrary to such opinion or statement. Except to the extent expressly set forth in this letter, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of any fact, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of any fact should be drawn from our representation of the Company or the rendering of this letter.
This letter is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America. We express no opinion as to matters relating to securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction or any rules or regulations thereunder (other than federal securities laws). This letter is based on the law in effect, and the facts and circumstances existing, on the date of this letter. We assume no obligation to update or supplement this letter to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention with respect to the opinions and statements expressed above, including any changes in applicable law which may hereafter occur.
This letter is being rendered and delivered solely to and for the benefit of the persons to whom it is addressed; accordingly, it may not be delivered to or relied upon by any other person (including, without limitation, any person who acquires the Notes from or through the Underwriter), quoted or filed with any governmental authority or other regulatory agency or otherwise circulated or utilized for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
 
 
 
 
For purposes of determining the "General Disclosure Package," the information contained in the foregoing documents shall be considered together.
 
Exhibit B
(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
(ii) The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
(iii) Each of the Company's Material Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and all the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Material Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully-paid and non-assessable, and (except in the case of foreign subsidiaries, for directors' qualifying shares) are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, security interests and claims.
(iv) To the best of my knowledge, and except as otherwise disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or, threatened to which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is or may be the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company, could individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and, to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; and there are no contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to either Registration Statement or required to be described in either Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are not filed or described as required.
(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Material Subsidiaries is, or with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would be, in violation of or in default under, its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them or any of their respective properties is bound, except for violations and defaults which individually and in the aggregate are not material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or to the holders of the Securities; the issue and sale of the Securities and the performance by the Company of all of its obligations under the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
 
agreement or other material agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is subject, nor will any such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or any applicable law or statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, its Material Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties.
(vi) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(vii) The information in the Prospectus incorporated by reference from Item 3 of Part I of the Company's Annual Report, as amended, on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005, in the Prospectus incorporated by reference from Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Reports on From 10-Q, if any, filed since the Annual Report, and in each Registration Statement under Item 15, to the extent that it constitutes summaries of legal matters, the Company's charter and bylaws or legal proceedings, is correct in all material respects.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).

rating
If the rating from Moody's is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Note will increase from the rate set forth on the face of this Note by the percentage set opposite that rating:
 
If the rating from S&P is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this Note will increase from the rate set forth on the face of this Note by the percentage set opposite that rating:
 
If Moody's or S&P subsequently increases its rating to the rating in effect on March 17, 2006, the interest rate on this Note will be decreased such that the interest rate for this Notes equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note. If Moody's or S&P subsequently increases its rating to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on this Note will be decreased such that the interest rate for this Note equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this
Note plus the percentages set opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase.

In no event shall (1) the interest rate for this Note be reduced to below the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note, and (2) the total increase in the interest rate on this Note exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note. If Moody's increases its rating to Baa2 and S&P increases its rating to BBB+, the interest rate on this Note will remain at, or be decreased to, as the case may be, the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note and no subsequent downgrades in a rating shall result in an adjustment of the interest rate on this Notes as provided herein.
If either Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of this Note necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate of this Note shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P ceasing to provide a rating. If both Moody's and S&P cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on this Note will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note.
Any interest rate increase or decrease, as described above, will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Notes may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
The Indenture provides that a series of Securities may include one or more tranches (each a "") of Securities, including Securities issued in a periodic offering.

We have examined (i) the Prospectus, (ii) the Registration Statements, (iii) the Indenture, (iv) the Notes in global form, (v) the executed Underwriting Agreement dated as of March 17, 2006 between the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"), (vi) certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted on May 15, 1998 and March 13, 2006, as certified by the Assistant Secretary of the Company on the date hereof as being complete, accurate and in effect, relating to, among other things, the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes (the "Board Resolutions"), and (vii) the officers' certificate dated as of the date hereof executed by duly authorized officers of the Company establishing the terms of the Notes pursuant to the Board Resolutions. We also have examined such records, documents and questions of law, and satisfied ourselves as to such matters of fact, as we have considered relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinion set forth below.

In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We also have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
The Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (except to the extent enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) when the Notes shall have been duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture and the Board Resolutions and shall have been duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor.
This opinion letter is limited to the Federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
We do not find it necessary for the purposes of this opinion letter to cover, and accordingly we express no opinion as to, the application of the securities or blue sky laws of the various states to sales of the Notes.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an Exhibit to the filing by the Company of a Current Report on Form 8-K on the date hereof, which Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statements, and to all references to our firm included in or made a part of the Prospectus. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act or the related rules promulgated by the SEC.
Very truly yours,
