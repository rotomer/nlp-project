Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 1, 2006, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the second quarter ending April 1, 2006. The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
The Company's press release regarding its second quarter results and conference call relating thereto includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, dispositions of assets or investments, BSE-related charges, litigation settlements, natural disaster related charges, non-recurring income tax adjustments and other similar events. The Company's management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Limitation on Incorporation by Reference
 
In accordance with general instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report, including exhibits, is furnished pursuant to Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.

TYSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER
AND SIX MONTHS RESULTS
 
 
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  May 1, 2006 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported a loss of $(0.37) per diluted share for the second fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2006, compared to $0.21 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Second quarter 2006 sales were $6.3 billion compared to $6.4 billion for the same period last year. Operating loss was $(141) million compared to operating income of $183 million, and net loss was $(127) million compared to net income of $76 million, for the same period last year.
 
Pretax loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 included $59 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of costs related to beef and prepared foods plant closings.
 
Pretax earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 included $2 million of costs related to poultry and prepared foods plant closings.
 
Loss per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2006 was $(0.26) compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.35 in the same period last year. Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2006 were $12.7 billion compared to $12.8 billion for the same period last year. Operating loss for the first six months of fiscal 2006 was $(27) million compared to operating income of $312 million, and net loss was $(88) million compared to net income of $124 million, for the same period last year.
 
Pretax loss for the first six months of fiscal 2006 included $59 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of costs related to beef and prepared foods plant closings.
 
Pretax earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2005 included $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation, a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Company's remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. and $5 million of costs related to poultry and prepared foods plant closings. The combined effect increased diluted earnings per share by $0.03.
 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company issued $1.0 billion of new 6.60% senior unsecured notes, which will mature in fiscal 2016. The Company will use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes and for the repayment of its outstanding $750 million principal amount of 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006. The Company's short-term investment currently includes $750 million of proceeds from the new issuance.  These funds are on deposit in an interest bearing account with a trustee and will be used for the repayment of the Notes maturing October 1, 2006.
 
"We said the second quarter would be very tough, and it was even tougher than we anticipated," John Tyson, chairman and CEO of Tyson Foods, said. "This quarter's results reflect the depressed markets and the oversupply of all proteins. The Beef segment suffered from low capacity utilization and declining boxed beef prices. The negative effect of high live cattle prices and lower sales prices was made worse by interruptions in export markets. Those factors combined to produce significant losses in the Beef segment. The protein oversupply, in addition to higher operating costs, affected our Pork segment as well.
 
"On the upside, the Company's sales volume increased and the Chicken segment stayed in positive territory. Our focus on value-added products and effective management of controllable costs helped our Chicken segment's performance. Also, I am encouraged by our Prepared Foods segment margins which, when adjusted for plant closings, continue to move in the right direction.

"The impact of the oversupply of protein is expected to diminish in the second half of the year. We expect the third and fourth quarters to be better as demand improves, but they still will be difficult.
 
"We recently announced Wade Miquelon will join us as CFO in June. We look forward to welcoming him to the Company, and we're excited about his experience in consumer products and international markets. He is joining a strong team, and together they will help us execute our business strategy."
 
Outlook
 
Based upon the Company's outlook for fiscal year 2006, including its view of all the various markets, the Company now estimates its fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $(0.25) to $0.10.

Chicken (32.2% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2006)
Chicken segment volume improvement was more than offset by lower sales prices, resulting in sales decreasing 2.2% and 1.8% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006 as compared to the same periods last year.
Chicken segment operating income decreased $134 million and $115 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. Operating income was negatively impacted by lower average sales prices, primarily due to an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace. Additionally, the discovery of H5N1 avian influenza in certain foreign markets reduced export prices. Unprecedented leg quarter inventories delayed the recovery of the export prices. Also, operating income was negatively impacted by higher energy costs, higher grain costs and decreased margins at the Company's operations in Mexico. Operating income was positively impacted by improved results from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases as it realized net losses of $4 million for both the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, as compared to net losses of $10 million and $33 million realized in the same periods last year.
                                                                                                                                                            
 
Beef (45.7% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2006)
Beef segment sales increased 2.9% and 3.6% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. The increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was primarily due to a 6.1% increase in sales volumes, offset partially by a 3.0% decrease in average sales prices. The increase in sales for the six months of fiscal 2006 was primarily due to a 3.2% increase in volumes, as well as a slight increase in average sales prices.
Beef segment operating results decreased $124 million and $162 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, excluding plant closing related accruals of $45 million recorded in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006 and $10 million received in the six months of fiscal 2005 in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Beef segment operating results were negatively impacted by continued high operating costs, the oversupply of proteins in the marketplace and by the continued restrictions of certain key beef export markets. Additionally, beef operating results for the three months ended April 1, 2006, were negatively impacted by net losses of $18 million from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef sales and forward live cattle purchases, a decrease of $28 million from the same period last year. Beef operating results for the six months ended April 1, 2006, were negatively impacted by $21 million from the Company's commodity risk management activities, a decrease of $19 million from the same period last year. Decreased volumes and margins at the Company's Lakeside operation in Canada, due in part to the labor strike occurring in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, also negatively impacted the Beef segment's operating results.

Pork (11.7% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2006)
Pork segment volume improvement was more than offset by lower sales prices, resulting in sales decreasing 12.0% and 9.1% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year.
Pork segment operating income decreased $10 million and $12 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, excluding $2 million received in the six months of fiscal 2005 in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Operating income was negatively impacted by higher operating costs per head and an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace, resulting in decreased average sales prices, partially offset by lower average live prices.
 
Prepared Foods (10.3% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2006)
Prepared Foods segment sales decreased 7.1% and 6.3% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, as compared to the same periods last year. The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices and slightly lower sales volumes, partially due to the planned rationalization of lower margin product lines.
Prepared Foods segment operating income increased $3 million and $12 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, excluding plant closing related accruals of $14 million recorded in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2006 and $3 million recorded in the six months of fiscal 2005. The increases were primarily due to decreased raw material costs, partially offset by lower average sales prices.
