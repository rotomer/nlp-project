AMENDMENT NO. 2 dated as of April 28, 2006 (this "
Amendment
") to the Five-Year Credit Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "
Credit Agreement
") dated as of September 28, 2005, among TYSON FOODS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "
Borrower
"); the LENDERS party thereto; JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as administrative agent (the "
Administrative Agent
"); MERRILL LYNCH BANK USA, as syndication agent; SUNTRUST BANK, COOPERATIEVE CENTRALE RAIFFEISEN-BOERENLEENBANK B.A. "RABOBANK INTERNATIONAL", NEW YORK BRANCH and BNP PARIBAS, as documentation agents; and COBANK, ACB and U.S. AGBANK, FCB, as co-documentation agents.
 
A. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
B. The Borrower has requested that the Lenders amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Majority Lenders are willing to agree to such amendments on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.
Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
SECTION 1.
Amendments
.
(a) The definition of "Applicable Rate" in Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:
""
Applicable Rate
" means, for any day, with respect to any Reference Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan, or with respect to the facility fees payable hereunder, as the case may be, the applicable rate per annum set forth below under the caption "Reference Rate Spread", "Eurodollar Spread and L/C Participation Fee" or "Facility Fee Rate", as the case may be, based upon the ratings by Moody's and S&P, respectively, applicable on such date to the Index Debt:
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of the foregoing, (a) if either Moody's or S&P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 6; (b) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within different Categories, the Applicable Rate shall be based on the higher of the two ratings unless the ratings differ by two or more Categories, in which case the Applicable Rate shall be based on the Category one level below that corresponding to the higher rating; and (c) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first publicly announced by Moody's or S&P. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation."
(b) Section 7.13 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:
 
 
 
 
"SECTION 7.13.
Leverage Ratio
. The Borrower shall not permit the Leverage Ratio at any time during any of the periods set forth below to exceed the ratio set forth opposite such period:
 
Third Quarter and Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006
 
(c) Section 7.14 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:
"SECTION 7.14.
Interest Expense Coverage Ratio
. The Borrower shall not permit the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than 3.00:1.00."
SECTION 2.

(a) the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV of the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects with the same effect as if made on and as of the date hereof, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date;

Nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle the Borrower to a consent to, or a waiver, amendment, modification or other change of, any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in similar or different circumstances. This Amendment shall apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Credit Agreement specifically referred to herein. This Amendment shall constitute a "Loan Document" for all purposes of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. As used therein, the terms "Agreement", "herein", "hereunder", "hereto", "hereof" and words of similar import shall, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to the Credit Agreement as modified hereby.
