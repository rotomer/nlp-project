Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On July 27, 2006, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a third amendment (the "Credit Amendment") to its Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of September 28, 2005, as previously amended (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), with the Company, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Merrill Lynch Bank USA, as syndication agent, Suntrust Bank, Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisenboerenleenbank B.A. "Rabobank International", New York Branch and BNP Paribas, as documentation agents, and CoBank, ACB and U.S. AGBank, FCB, as co-documentation agents. Also on July 27, 2006, Lakeside Farm Industries, Ltd., an Alberta corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company ("Lakeside"), entered into a third amendment (the "Term Loan Amendment") to its Three-Year Term Loan Agreement dated as of September 28, 2005, as previously amended (the "Term Loan"), with Lakeside, as borrower, the Company and Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch, as administrative agent, Merrill Lynch Capital Canada Inc., as syndication agent, and Rabobank Nederland Canadian Branch and BNP Paribas (Canada), as documentation agents.
 
Pursuant to the Credit Amendment and the Term Loan Amendment (collectively, the "Amendments"), the Company's Leverage Ratio requirements were amended to provide that the Company shall not permit such ratio to exceed the levels set forth below at any time during any of the periods set forth:
 
 
The Amendments also modified the Company's ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense providing that such ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters may not exceed the ratios set forth below at any time during any of the periods set forth:
 
 
In addition, the Amendments set forth certain new financial covenants. The new covenants provide that the Company may not permit consolidated EBITDA (as adjusted for certain non-cash charges and extraordinary gains and losses) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending with any fiscal quarter referred to below to be less than the amount set forth below with respect to such quarter:
 
 
The new covenants also limit availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan, prior to the date the Company demonstrates certain covenant compliance for second quarter of 2007, to 50% of the Company's consolidated inventories less the amounts outstanding under Term Loan Facility. The Amendments also provide that if the Company's senior unsecured debt is rated either Ba1 by Moody's and BB+ by Standard & Poor's or Ba2 or lower by Moody's or BB or lower by Standard & Poor's then certain subsidiaries of the Company will be required to execute agreements guaranteeing the obligations of the Company
 
 
 
and Lakeside under their respective agreements. This condition will be automatically removed when (a) the Company demonstrates certain covenant compliance for second quarter of 2007 and (b) either Moody's or Standard & Poor's raises the Company's unsecured debt rating to Baa3/BBB- and the lower of the two ratings is not lower than Ba1/BB+.
Copies of the Credit Amendment and the Term Loan Amendment are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, hereto and both amendments are incorporated by reference herein. The description of the Amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendments. Terms not otherwise defined herein have the same definition as provided in the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan.
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 31, 2006, the Company issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the third quarter ending July 1, 2006. In addition, the Company announced it has initiated a review of its tax account balances due to differences in deferred tax liabilities related to temporary book to tax basis differences on certain lease agreements. The press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
The Company's press release regarding its third quarter results and conference call relating thereto includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings per share and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, dispositions of assets or investments, BSE-related charges, litigation settlements, natural disaster related charges, non-recurring income tax adjustments and other similar events. The Company's management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. Management also believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Limitation on Incorporation by Reference
 
In accordance with general instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report, including exhibits, is furnished pursuant to Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.

TYSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER
AND NINE MONTHS RESULTS
 
 
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  July 31, 2006 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported a loss of $0.15 per diluted share for the third fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2006, compared to $0.36 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Third quarter 2006 sales were $6.4 billion compared to $6.7 billion for the same period last year. Operating loss was $25 million compared to operating income of $256 million, and net loss was $52 million compared to net income of $131 million, for the same period last year.
 
Loss per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 was $0.41 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.71 in the same period last year. Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 were $19.1 billion compared to $19.5 billion for the same period last year. Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 was $57 million compared to operating income of $557 million, and net loss was $140 million compared to net income of $255 million, for the same period last year.
 
Pretax loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 included $59 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of costs related to beef and prepared foods plant closings.
 
Pretax earnings for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 included costs of $33 million related to a legal settlement involving the Company's live swine operations, and $10 million and $15 million, respectively, related to poultry and prepared foods plant closings. The nine months of fiscal 2005 included $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Company's remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. The combined effect of these items decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.05 for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively.
 
"Our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments' operating results improved $126 million over the second quarter, excluding plant closing charges of $59 million," said Richard L. Bond, president and chief executive officer. "However, despite improvements, the third quarter remained challenging with losses in the Chicken and Beef segments. The oversupply of chicken and forward sales of leg quarters led to lower average sales prices in the third quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In our Beef segment, May and June were positive, but not enough to offset a very difficult April.
In addition, our Canadian operations continue to struggle, compounded by the strong Canadian currency.
 
"According to poultry industry production data, supply and demand should be in better balance during the remainder of the fourth quarter, and we expect our Chicken segment to post positive results. Although forward leg quarter sales adversely affected July, leg quarter pricing for August and September will be significantly better. As cattle supplies continue to increase year over year, we expect our Beef segment to break even in the fourth quarter. We expect Prepared Foods earnings to improve and the Pork segment should remain flat.
 
"The Company's operating results improved significantly from the second quarter to the third quarter, and we expect the improvement to continue into the fourth quarter. We are projecting a diluted loss per share range of $0.41 to $0.51 for the fiscal year.
 
"We are taking aggressive measures to return the company to profitability as soon as possible. Our chicken inventories have been significantly reduced from historical highs, and we are reviewing our structure and processes to ensure efficient and cost effective operations throughout our company," Bond said. "We have implemented a comprehensive cost management initiative to generate approximately $200 million in cost reductions. Approximately half will be divided equally among consulting and professional fees, sales and marketing. The remaining $100 million is expected to be divided equally between staffing costs and other expenses."

Tax Account Balance Review
Tyson announced it started a review of its tax account balances. In connection with its renewal of certain leases, the Company noted differences in deferred tax liabilities related to temporary book to tax basis differences. At this time, the tax effect of the aggregate basis differences related to the leases is an understatement of approximately $22 million.
 
Tyson initiated a review process to assess the adequacy of tax liabilities recorded for basis differences and for all of its tax account balances, not just those related to its lease agreements. As this process continues, additional information, including additional temporary differences, positive or negative, may be discovered which could materially impact the accounting for the preliminary differences indicated above. However, management does not believe this will have a material impact on the results of operations for the nine months ended July 1, 2006 or July 2, 2005. Once the review is completed, which is currently expected to be by October 31, 2006, the Company will make a final determination as to what, if any, adjustments should be recorded in the Company's financial statements and in which period any such adjustments should be recorded.
 
Outlook
 
Based upon the Company's outlook for fiscal year 2006, including its view of all the various markets, the Company now estimates its fiscal 2006 diluted loss per share to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.51.

Chicken (30.1% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2006)
While Chicken sales volumes increased 7.0% and 4.8% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, lower average sales prices in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006 resulted in decreased Chicken segment sales of 7.8% and 3.9%, respectively.
Chicken segment operating results decreased $267 million and $384 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, excluding plant closing related accruals of $10 million recorded in the three months of fiscal 2005 and $12 million recorded in the nine months of fiscal 2005. The decreases in operating results were primarily due to lower average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace. Additionally, operating results were negatively impacted by the forward sales of leg quarter inventories at lower prices.
                                                                                  
Also, operating results were negatively impacted by higher energy costs, higher grain costs and decreased margins at the Company's operations in Mexico. Chicken operating results for the nine months ended July 1, 2006 were positively impacted by a net loss of less than $1 million from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases as compared to net losses of $28 million realized in the same period last year.
 
Beef (47.5% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2006)
While Beef sales volumes increased 6.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, as compared to the same period last year, lower average sales prices more than offset the volume increase and resulted in decreased Beef segment sales of 2.3%. Beef segment sales increased 1.5% in the nine months of fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period last year. The increase in sales for the nine months of fiscal 2006 was primarily due to a 4.2% increase in sales volumes, offset partially by a 2.6% decrease in average sales prices.
Beef segment operating results decreased $46 million and $208 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, excluding plant closing related accruals of $45 million recorded in the nine months of fiscal 2006 and $10 million received in the nine months of fiscal 2005 in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. The decreases in Beef segment operating results were primarily due to significant operating margin reductions at the Company's Lakeside operation in Canada. Additionally, beef operating results for the three months ended July 1, 2006, were negatively impacted by net losses of $19 million from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef sales and forward live cattle purchases, a decline of $10 million from the same period last year. Beef operating results for the nine months ended July 1, 2006, were negatively impacted by $40 million from the Company's commodity risk management activities, a decline of $29 million from the same period last year.

Pork (11.8% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2006)
Pork segment sales decreased 7.0% and 8.4% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices.
Pork segment operating results decreased $2 million and $14 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, excluding $33 million of costs related to a live swine legal settlement recorded in the three and nine months of fiscal 2005 and $2 million received in the nine months of fiscal 2005 in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Operating results were negatively impacted by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace, resulting in decreased average sales prices, partially offset by lower average live prices.
 
Prepared Foods (10.4% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2006)
Prepared Foods segment sales decreased 5.0% and 5.9% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006, as compared to the same periods last year. The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices.
Prepared Foods segment operating income decreased $15 million and $3 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2006, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, excluding plant closing related accruals of $14 million recorded in the nine months of fiscal 2006 and $3 million recorded in the nine months of fiscal 2005. The decreases were primarily due to lower average sales prices and higher operating costs.
