TYSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER
AND FISCAL YEAR 2006 RESULTS
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  November 13, 2006 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported a net loss of $0.17 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to $0.33 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2006 and 2005 sales were both $6.5 billion. Operating loss was $20 million compared to operating income of $188 million, and net loss was $56 million compared to net income of $117 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and 2005.
 
Net loss per diluted share for fiscal 2006 was $0.58 compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.04 for last year. Sales for fiscal 2006 were $25.6 billion compared to $26.0 billion for last year. Operating loss was $77 million compared to operating income of $745 million, and net loss was $196 million compared to net income of $372 million, respectively, for fiscal 2006 and 2005.
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded pretax charges totaling $23 million associated with the Company's previously announced $200 million cost reduction initiative, plant closing costs and other business consolidation efforts. These charges included severance expenses, product rationalization costs and other asset impairment related expenses. The Company previously recorded plant closing costs of $59 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2006. The combined effect of these items impacted net loss by $0.04 and $0.15 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006.
 
As previously announced, the Company began a review in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of its tax account balances as a result of differences noted in deferred tax liabilities related to temporary book to tax differences. At the time of the previous announcement, the Company disclosed the tax effect of the aggregated basis differences was an understatement of approximately $22 million. While the Company is nearing completion, the review is not yet final. Based upon the information available at this time, the Company recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of approximately $15 million or $0.04 per diluted share. As the Company completes its process, additional information may become available that could change the amount and timing of the charge (which includes the results reported in this release). The Company expects to complete its assessment prior to filing its fiscal 2006 Form 10-K.
 
Net loss for the fourth quarter and 12 months of fiscal 2006 includes a charge of $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.
 
"The best thing I can say about fiscal 2006 is, it's over," said Richard L. Bond, president and chief executive officer. "For most of the year, we were plagued by supply and demand imbalance as well as export market disruptions in our chicken and beef segments. Despite some continuing problems in the protein sector, during the quarter our core business showed improvement and continued to strengthen.
 
"In addition, we successfully launched several programs that will better position us for 2007 and beyond," Bond said. "We implemented a comprehensive cost management initiative to generate approximately $200 million in annual savings. We also consolidated beef processing facilities, refocused on running cost-efficient and competitive operations and introduced price increases across retail and foodservice channels. Finally, we have enhanced our strong management team by adding several key executives in our finance, consumer products and international groups. I believe the solid execution of these and other initiatives by Tyson Team Members is favorably impacting our business. We set a short-term goal to return to profitability, and based on our business performance to date, I am very confident we will achieve it in our first fiscal quarter of 2007."

Chicken (30.3% of Net Sales  4th Quarter 2006)
Chicken segment sales were $2.0 billion and $7.9 billion in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006, respectively. Chicken segment operating loss was $20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, and operating income was $53 million in fiscal 2006. The operating results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 include charges of $9 million related to the Company's cost reduction initiative, other business consolidation efforts and plant closing costs. Low average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace, adversely impacted sales and operating results. Additionally, the Chicken segment's operating results were negatively impacted by higher energy costs and decreased margins at the Company's operations in Mexico.
 
Beef (46.7% of Net Sales  4th Quarter 2006)
Beef segment sales were $3.0 billion and $11.8 billion in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006, respectively. Beef segment operating loss was $34 million and $296 million in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006, respectively. The operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 include $7 million and $52 million, respectively, related to plant closing costs, the Company's cost reduction initiative and other business consolidation efforts. Low average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace, adversely impacted sales and operating results. Additionally, the Beef segment's operating results were negatively impacted by significant operating margin reductions at the Company's Lakeside operation in Canada.
 
Pork (12.1% of Net Sales  4th Quarter 2006)
Pork segment sales were $785 million and $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006, respectively. Pork segment operating income was $15 million and $47 million in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006, respectively. The operating results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 include $2 million related to the Company's cost reduction initiative and other business consolidation efforts. Low average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace, adversely impacted sales and operating results. The low average sales prices were partially offset by low average live prices.
 
Prepared Foods (10.8% of Net Sales 4th Quarter 2006)
Prepared Foods segment sales were $697 million and $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006, respectively. Prepared Foods operating loss was $1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and operating income was $45 million for the fiscal year 2006. The operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 include $5 million and $19 million, respectively, related to plant closing costs, other business consolidation efforts and the Company's cost reduction initiative. Operating results were negatively impacted by low average sales prices and higher than anticipated bacon raw material costs.
