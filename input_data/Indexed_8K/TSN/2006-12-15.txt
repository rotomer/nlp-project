General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") presently maintains the Tyson Foods, Inc. Annual Incentive Compensation Plan for Senior Executive Officers (the "Executive Incentive Plan"), which was approved by the Company's shareholders during fiscal 2005. The Executive Incentive Plan provides for cash bonus eligibility for members of the Company's senior management team designated by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") based on performance measures established by the Compensation Committee.
 
As previously reported, on November 16, 2006, the Compensation Committee designated Richard L. Bond, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lee, Chief Administrative Officer and President, International, as eligible participants under the Executive Incentive Plan, and determined that achievement of a threshold Adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes after adjustment for extraordinary items) amount would be the performance measure under the Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2007. On December 12, 2006, the Compensation Committee determined that John Tyson, Chairman of the Board of Directors, would also be an eligible participant under the Executive Incentive Plan. The individual annual incentive bonus for which Messrs. Tyson, Bond and Lee are eligible will be determined by (1) taking the amount by which Adjusted EBIT exceeds $570,000,000 up to $1,036,000,000 multiplied by the percentage set forth in column (a) below by each participant's name and (2) adding to that product, if applicable, the amount by which Adjusted EBIT exceeds $1,036,000,000 multiplied by the percentage set forth in column (b) below by each participant's name:
 
 
However, in no event will any participant be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus payment in excess of $10,000,000.
