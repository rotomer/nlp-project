The Executive Committee may act by a majority of its members at a meeting or informally without a meeting, provided that all members thereof sign a writing reflecting such informal action. Any act or authorization of any act by the Executive Committee, within the authority delegated above, shall be as effective for all purposes as the act or authorization of the Board of Directors; provided that the designation of such an Executive Committee and the delegation of authority thereto shall not operate to relieve the Board of Directors of any responsibility imposed upon it by law.
 
         
Section 10
.
Compensation
. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, an annual retainer or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
