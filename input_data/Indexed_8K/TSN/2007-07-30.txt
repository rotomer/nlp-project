TYSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER

Springdale, Arkansas  July 30, 2007 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported earnings of $0.31 per diluted share for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007, compared to a loss of $0.15 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Third quarter 2007 sales were $7.0 billion compared to $6.4 billion for the same period last year. Operating income was $209 million compared to operating loss of $25 million, and net income was $111 million compared to a net loss of $52 million, for the same period last year.
 
Diluted earnings per share for the nine months of fiscal 2007 were $0.66 compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.41 in the same period last year. Sales for the nine months of fiscal 2007 were $20.0 billion compared to $19.1 billion for the same period last year. Operating income for the nine months of fiscal 2007 was $512 million compared to operating loss of $57 million, and net income was $236 million compared to net loss of $140 million, for the same period last year. Operating loss for the nine months of fiscal 2006 included $59 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of costs related to beef and prepared foods plant closings.
 
"This was another good quarter for us, and all the credit goes to Tyson team members," said Richard L. Bond, president and chief executive officer. "They're focused intently on executing our business plans and Cost Management Initiative, and our earnings reflect their work.
 
"Sales dollars, operating income and operating margins are greatly improved in all four segments over the third quarter of 2006 as well as the second quarter of 2007," Bond said. "Sales volumes were down overall, primarily as a result of planned production cuts and the impact of price increases.
 
"It's an exciting time to be at Tyson Foods with our Raised Without Antibiotics and Any'tizers product launches, the new "Thank You, Mom" advertising campaign and our renewable fuels venture with Syntroleum. We will continue working toward more game changers like these for our company."

Chicken segment sales were $2.1 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007. Chicken segment operating income was $95 million and $229 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007. Operating results were impacted positively by improved average sales prices, partially offset by decreased sales volumes as a result of planned production cuts, the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities, lower leg quarter volumes and the closure of a poultry plant in fiscal 2006 due to a fire. Operating results were also adversely impacted by increased net grain costs of $113 million and $138 million, respectively, for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2006. The increase of net grain costs for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007 includes $120 million and $229 million of increased grain costs partially offset by increased net gains of $7 million and $91 million, respectively, from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2006. Additionally, operating income improved due to decreased selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months of fiscal 2007 as compared to the same period last year. Also, in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recognized a gain of $10 million related to the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities.

Beef segment operating income was $33 million and $34 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007. Operating results were positively impacted by increased average sales prices, prior year plant rationalizations, operating cost efficiencies and yield improvements, partially offset by higher average live prices. Operating loss for the nine months of fiscal 2006 included $44 million of plant closing related accruals. Operating results were also positively impacted in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007 by improvements of $39 million and $34 million, respectively, from the Company's commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle, excluding the related impact from the physical purchase transactions, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2006. Additionally, operating results improved due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the same periods last year.

Pork segment sales were $853 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007. Pork segment operating income was $37 million and $111 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007. Operating results were impacted positively by higher average sales prices, strong export sales, increased sales volumes, operating cost efficiencies and yield improvements, partially offset by higher average live prices.
 
Prepared Foods (9.6% of Net Sales, 12.4% of Total Operating Income  3rd Quarter 2007)
 
Prepared Foods segment sales were $666 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007. Prepared Foods segment operating income was $26 million and $77 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007.

Operating income for the nine months of fiscal 2006 included $13 million of plant closing related accruals.
