TYSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER
AND SIX MONTHS RESULTS
 
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  April 28, 2008 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported a loss of $0.02 per diluted share for the second fiscal quarter ended March 29, 2008, compared to $0.19 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Second quarter 2008 sales were $6.6 billion compared to $6.5 billion for the same period last year. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $44 million compared to $158 million, and net loss was $5 million compared to net income of $68 million, for the same period last year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded $47 million of charges related to plant closings and asset impairments.
 
Diluted earnings per share for the six months of fiscal 2008 were $0.08 compared to $0.35 in the same period last year. Sales for the six months of fiscal 2008 were $13.4 billion compared to $13.1 billion for the same period last year. Operating income for the six months of fiscal 2008 was $128 million compared to $303 million, and net income was $29 million compared to $125 million, for the same period last year. In the six months of fiscal 2008, we recorded an $18 million non-operating gain on the sale of an investment. Additionally, we recorded $53 million of charges related to plant closings, asset impairments and severance.
 
"Our second quarter results show the strength of a diversified protein business model," said Richard L. Bond, president and chief executive officer of Tyson Foods. "We continue to believe the second fiscal quarter should be our most challenging, and we are pleased with our results.
 
"Our Pork segment did very well, delivering its best January-March quarter ever," Bond said. "Our Beef segment improved $74 million over the first quarter of this fiscal year, or approximately $100 million excluding plant closing and asset impairment charges. The Chicken segment suffered losses due to significantly higher and volatile input costs. Our chicken and pork exports continue to be strong, and we are moving forward with our strategy for international expansion.
 
"Looking forward to the third quarter, the Beef segment should continue its improvement due to the start of grilling season and the encouraging news South Korea will resume imports of U.S. beef next month," Bond said. "The Pork segment should do well again, although not as well as the second quarter. In the Chicken segment, we anticipate an additional $100 million of increased grain costs over the second quarter, offset in part by operational improvements, pricing and risk management activities. For the year, corn and soybean meal increases are likely to approach $600 million. Including other inputs such as cooking oil, breading and other feed ingredients, the increase in costs for the fiscal year may approach $1 billion compared to fiscal 2007."

Chicken (32.6% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2008)
 
Chicken segment sales were $2.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Operating loss was $61 million and $26 million, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Sales increased as compared to the same periods in 2007 due to an increase in average sales prices, as well as an increase in sales volumes when excluding the impact of the sale of two poultry plants in fiscal 2007. Operating results were adversely impacted by increased grain costs of $102 million and $209 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods for fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher, largely due to increased advertising costs and a gain recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the sale of an aircraft. Operating results for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $13 million related to closing our Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Cooked Products plant and $5 million in software impairment charges.
 
Beef (45.3% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2008)
 
Beef segment sales were $3.0 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Operating loss was $11 million and $96 million, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Operating results for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008 were negatively impacted by higher operating costs and losses at our Lakeside operation in Canada. Operating results for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $17 million related to restructuring operations at the Emporia, Kansas, plant, as well as $8 million related to an impairment of packaging equipment.
 
Pork (12.4% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2008)
 
Pork segment sales were $822 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Operating income was $63 million and $139 million, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Operating results as compared to the same periods in 2007 were impacted positively by lower average live prices, partially offset by lower average sales prices and higher operating costs. Operating results were also positively impacted by strong export sales, which led to increased sales volumes. Operating results for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $4 million related to an impairment of packaging equipment.
 
Prepared Foods (9.6% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2008)
 
Prepared Foods segment sales were $632 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Operating income was $20 million and $52 million, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008. Operating results as compared to the same periods in 2007 were negatively impacted by lower average sales prices. Raw material costs increased slightly, which included lower pork costs, offset by higher wheat costs. Operating income for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2007 included an intangible asset impairment charge of $6 million.
