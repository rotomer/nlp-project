the Effective Date) Officer has had and will continue to have access to confidential information in multiple forms, electronic or otherwise, such confidential information including but not being limited to trade secrets, proprietary information, intellectual property, and other documents, data, and information concerning methods, processes, controls, techniques, formulas, production, distribution, purchasing, financial analysis, returns and reports (in addition if Officer is involved with marketing, sales or procurement Officer has had and will continue to have access to lists of customers, suppliers, vendors, and accounts, other sensitive information and data regarding the customers, suppliers, vendors, services, sales, pricing, and costs of Employer which are highly confidential and constitute trade secrets or confidential business information) which is the property of and integral to the operations and success of Employer, and therefore agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 8, which Officer agrees and acknowledges to be reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate and important business interests and concerns of Employer. Officer acknowledges that the information referred to above has independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use. Officer further acknowledges that Employer has taken all reasonable steps under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy and/or confidentiality of such information.
(c)      Officer agrees that Officer will not divulge to any person, nor use to the detriment of Employer, nor use in any business or process of manufacture competitive with or similar to any business or process of manufacture of Employer, at any time during Period of Employment or thereafter, any of the trade secrets and/or other confidential information of the Employer, whether in electronic form or otherwise, without first obtaining the express written permission of Employer. A trade secret shall include any information maintained as confidential and used by Employer in its business, including but not limited to a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that has value, actual or potential, from its confidentiality and from not being readily ascertainable to others who could also obtain value from such information. For purposes of this Section 8, the compilation of information used by Employer in its business shall include, without limitation, the identity of customers and suppliers and information reflecting their interests, preferences, credit-worthiness, likely
 
 
 
receptivity to solicitation for participation in various transactions and related information obtained during the course of Officers employment with Employer.
(d)      Officer agrees that at the time of leaving the employ of Employer, Officer will deliver to Employer, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all originals and copies, electronic or hard copy, of notebooks, memoranda, documents, communications, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the business of Employer, or constituting property of the Employer. Officer further agrees that Officer will not, directly or indirectly, request or advise any customers or suppliers of Employer to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with Employer.
(e)      During Officers Period of Employment with the Employer and for a period of one (1) year after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer will not directly or indirectly, in the United States, participate in any Position in any business in Direct Competition with the business of the Employer. The term Direct Competition, as used in this section, shall mean any business that directly competes against any line of business in which Officer was actively engaged during Officers employment with the Employer. The term Position, as used in this section, includes a partner, director, holder of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares, principal, executive, officer, manager or any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer, where Officer performs any duties which are substantially similar to those performed by the Officer during Officers employment with Employer. Officer acknowledges that a substantially similar position shall include any position in which Officer might be able to utilize the valuable, proprietary and confidential information to which Officer was exposed during Officers employment with Employer. It is acknowledged and agreed that the scope of the clause as set forth above is essential, because 1) a more restrictive definition of Position (e.g. limiting it to the same position with a competitor) will subject the Employer to serious, irreparable harm by allowing competitors to describe positions in ways to evade the operation of this clause, and substantially restrict the protection sought by Employer, and 2) by allowing the Officer to escape the application of this clause by accepting a position designated as a lesser or different
 
 
 
position with a competitor, the Employer is unable to restrict the Officer from providing valuable information to such competing entity to the harm of the Employer.
(f)       Officer recognizes that Officer possesses confidential information and trade secrets about other employees of Employer relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, salary and benefits, and interpersonal relationships with customers and suppliers of Employer. Officer recognizes that the information Officer possesses about these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Employer in securing and retaining customers and suppliers, and was acquired by Officer because of Officers business position with Employer. Officer agrees that during Officers Period of Employment hereunder, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive, if applicable, the expiration of the Period of Employment), Officer shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee or agent of Employer, with a view to or for the purposes of inducing or encouraging such employee or agent to leave the employ of Employer, for the purpose of being hired by Officer, any employer affiliated with Officer, or any competitor of Employer. Officer agrees that Officer will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees to anyone affiliated with Officer or to any competitor of Employer.
(g)      Officer acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect Employers interest in this Agreement and that any breach thereof will result in an irreparable injury to Employer for which Employer has no adequate remedy at law. Officer therefore agrees that, in the event Officer breaches any of the provisions contained in this Section 8, Employer shall be authorized and entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction (i) a temporary restraining order, (ii) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, (iii) an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such breach, (iv) direct, incidental and consequential damages arising from such breach; and/or(v) all reasonable legal fees and costs related to any actions taken by Employer to enforce Section 8.
(h)      Employer and Officer have attempted to specify a reasonable period of time, a reasonable area and reasonable restrictions to which this Section 8 shall apply. Employer and Officer agree that if a court or administrative body should subsequently determine that the terms of this Section 8 are greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest,
 
 
Employer agrees to waive those terms which are found by a court or administrative body to be greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest and to request that the court or administrative body reform this Agreement specifying a reasonable period of time and such other reasonable restrictions as the court or administrative body deems necessary. Further, Officer agrees that Employer shall have the right to amend or modify this Section 8 as necessary to comport with the determination of any court or administrative body that such Section in this or a similar agreement entered into by Employer with any other officer or manager of Employer is greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest.
(i) Officer further agrees that this Section 8, as well as the Sections 12 and 13 relating to choice of law and forum for resolution, are integral parts of this Agreement, and that should a court fail or refuse to enforce the restrictions contained herein in the manner expressly provided in Sections 8(a) through 8(g) above, the Employer shall recover from Officer, and the court shall award to the Employer, the consideration (or a pro-rata portion thereof to the extent these provisions are enforced but the time frame is reduced beyond that specified above) provided to and elected by Officer under the terms of Section 8(a) above (or the monetary equivalent thereof), its cost and its reasonable attorneys fees. Officer acknowledges that such award is not intended as liquidated damages and is not exclusive to other remedies available to Employer. Instead such award is intended to ensure that Officer is not unjustly enriched as a result of retaining contract benefits not earned by Officer.
9.
Termination for Egregious Circumstances
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including the terms of Section 7 hereof, Employer may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate this Agreement, and Officers Period of Employment hereunder without any payment, liability or other obligation, in the event, (a) Officer engages in misconduct which results in injury to the Employer, or (b) Officer is convicted of a job-related felony or misdemeanor.
10.
Modification
. This Agreement contains all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties hereto, and no other agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be deemed to exist or bind either of the parties hereto, except for any pre-employment confidentiality agreement that may exist between the parties. This Agreement cannot be modified except by a writing signed by both parties.
 
 
11.
Assignment.
This Agreement shall be binding upon Officer, Officers heirs, executors and personal representatives and upon Employer, its successors and assigns. Officer may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without first obtaining the written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

. Officer acknowledges that this Agreement is performable at various locations throughout the United States and specifically performable wholly or partly within the State of Delaware and consents to the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement being governed by the internal laws of said State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
13.
Jurisdiction and Venue of Disputes.
The courts of Washington County, Arkansas shall have exclusive jurisdiction and be the venue of all disputes between the Employer and Officer, whether such disputes arise from this Agreement or otherwise. In addition, Officer expressly waives any right Officer may have to sue or be sued in the county of Officers residence and consents to venue in Washington County, Arkansas.
14.
Acceleration Upon a Change in Control.
Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (defined below) the restricted Common Stock, stock options, and Performance Stock that have been granted to Officer pursuant to an award agreement from the Employer under Sections 8(a)(i),(ii) and (iii), or which have otherwise been previously granted to Officer under an award agreement from the Employer; and which awards are unvested at the time of the Change in Control, will vest sixty (60) days after the Change in Control event occurs (unless vesting earlier pursuant to the terms of an award agreement). If the Officer is terminated by the Employer other than for egregious circumstances during such sixty (60) day period, all of the unvested restricted Common Stock, stock options, and Performance Stock granted pursuant to such award agreements will vest on the date of termination. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control" shall have the same meaning as the term "Change in Control" as set forth in the Plan; provided, however, that a Change in Control shall not include any event as a result of which one or more of the following persons or entities possess, immediately after such event, over fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Employer or, if applicable, a successor entity: (a) Don Tyson; (b) individuals related to Don Tyson by blood, marriage or adoption, or the estate of any such individual; or (c) any entity (including, but not limited to, a

The Committee shall have the sole discretion to interpret the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Tyson Chief Financial Officer Accepts New Position
Miquelon to join leading retail pharmacy chain
 
Springdale, Arkansas  May 12, 2008  The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) is leaving the company to accept a similar position with the nations largest retail pharmacy chain.
 
Wade Miquelon has accepted the job of Chief Financial Officer of Walgreens, one of the nations fastest growing retailers with fiscal 2007 sales of almost $54 billion. The Deerfield, Illinois, company expects to open 550 stores in fiscal 2008.
 
We will miss the passion and strategic approach Wade brought to his job here at Tyson, but realize the move to Walgreens is a great opportunity for him and his family, said Dick Bond, president and CEO of Tyson Foods. While hes only been with us for two years, we believe he has strengthened our finance and accounting functions by helping them move beyond financial reporting to become more in tune with our overall operations.
 
I leave with reluctance because of the wonderful people Ive worked with and the great experiences Ive had, and Im confident about the future success of Tyson Foods, said Miquelon. Tyson is in a very dynamic business, and has an outstanding team of forward-looking people and an excellent strategic plan, which I believe will continue to keep the company moving in the right direction.
 
Tyson management will now begin the process of finding a replacement for Miquelon, who left The Procter & Gamble Company to accept Tysons chief financial post in April 2006. Dennis Leatherby, who is Tysons senior vice president of finance and treasurer, will assume Miquelons responsibilities until the job is filled.
 
Miquelon will remain with Tyson until mid-June, completing his work on some strategic objectives and also assisting with the transition process.
 
Tyson Foods, Inc. [NYSE: TSN], founded in 1935 with headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, is the worlds largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, the second-largest food production company in the Fortune 500 and a member of the S&P 500.
