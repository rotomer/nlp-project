TYSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER
AND NINE MONTHS RESULTS
 
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  July 28, 2008 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for the fiscal quarter ended June 28, 2008, compared to $0.31 diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. Third quarter 2008 sales were $6.8 billion compared to $6.6 billion for the same period last year. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $45 million compared to $212 million, and net income was $9 million compared to $111 million, for the same period last year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, operating income included $13 million of charges, or $0.02 per share after tax, related to asset impairments and excluded $18 million of pretax income related to our discontinued Lakeside operation. Results of our continuing operations were a loss of $0.01 and earnings of $0.32 in the third quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Results of our discontinued operations were earnings of $0.04 and a loss of $0.01 in the third quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
Diluted earnings per share for the nine months of fiscal 2008 were $0.11 compared to $0.66 in the same period last year. Sales for the nine months of fiscal 2008 were $19.7 billion compared to $19.2 billion for the same period last year. Operating income for the nine months of fiscal 2008 was $193 million compared to $511 million, and net income was $38 million compared to $236 million, for the same period last year. In the nine months of fiscal 2008, we recorded an $18 million non-operating gain on the sale of an investment, and $66 million of charges related to plant closings, asset impairments and severance. Results of our continuing operations were earnings of $0.12 and $0.66 in the nine months of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Results of our discontinued operations were a loss of $0.01 and $0.00 in the nine months of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
On June 25, 2008, we entered into a letter of intent with XL Foods Inc. to sell the beef processing, cattle feedyard and fertilizer assets of Lakeside Farm Industries Ltd in Alberta, Canada. The transaction remains subject to government approvals, the receipt of commercially reasonable financing by XL Foods and the execution of a definitive agreement between Tyson and XL Foods. We hope to complete the sale by the end of fiscal 2008. The results for Lakeside, current and prior periods, are reported as discontinued operations.
 
"In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, Tyson Foods' diversified business offset the losses incurred by our Chicken segment, which is experiencing more difficult market dynamics," said Richard L. Bond, president and chief executive officer. "Our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments were profitable, while our Chicken segment suffered a loss.
 
"Beef performed better than expected, although results were masked by a negative $75 million impact from application of mark-to-market accounting treatment related to our unrealized derivative losses for forward cattle purchases and forward boxed beef sales," Bond said. "Although we will profit from this risk management activity over the coming months, it disguises an otherwise solid performance in our beef operations this quarter.
 
"For the third consecutive quarter, our Pork segment achieved a margin above the normalized range. Sales were up for the quarter as well. Prepared Foods sales and volume were up slightly over the same quarter last year; however, operating income was down significantly due to increased raw material costs, including wheat, dairy and cooking ingredients in addition to charges related to flood damage at our plant in Jefferson, Wisconsin," Bond said.
 
"The Chicken segment remains under pressure from higher input costs, although we have been able to offset some losses through pricing and risk management activities. Grain costs were up an additional $140 million compared to the third quarter of 2007 and are expected to increase approximately $550 million for fiscal 2008. There has been a tremendous effort by our poultry operations, sales and marketing teams to improve efficiencies and develop products to meet our customers' needs in this economy. I am confident our chicken business will be well positioned when the economics improve," Bond said.

Chicken (32.9% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2008)
Chicken segment sales were $2.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating loss was $44 million and $70 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Sales increased as compared to the same periods in 2007 due to an increase in average sales prices, as well as an increase in sales volumes when excluding the impact of the sale of two poultry plants in fiscal 2007. Operating results were adversely impacted by an increase in grain costs for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008 of $140 million and $349 million, respectively, partially offset by net gains of $59 million and $49 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2007. Operating results were also negatively impacted by increased raw material, logistics and energy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher for the nine months of fiscal 2008 as compared to the same period last year, largely due to increased advertising costs and a gain recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the sale of an aircraft. Operating results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $6 million related to impairment of unimproved real property. Operating results for the nine months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $13 million related to closing our Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Cooked Products plant and $5 million in software impairment charges. Operating results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2007 included a $10 million gain on sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities.
 
Beef (43.5% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2008)
Beef segment sales were $3.0 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating income was $3 million and operating loss was $73 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating results as compared to the same periods in 2007 were impacted positively by higher average sales prices, lower average live prices in the third quarter, and partially offset by higher average live prices in the nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating results were negatively impacted in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008 by declines of $95 million and $22 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2007. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which will impact future period operating results. Operating results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008 were negatively impacted by higher operating costs, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2007. Operating results for the nine months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $17 million related to restructuring operations at the Emporia, Kansas, plant, as well as $8 million related to an impairment of packaging equipment.
 
Pork (13.5% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2008)
Pork segment sales were $926 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating income was $54 million and $193 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating results as compared to the same periods in 2007 were impacted positively by lower average live prices, higher average sales prices in the third quarter, partially offset by lower average sales prices in the nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating results were also positively impacted in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008 by improvements of $10 million and $86 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live hogs as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2007. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which will impact future period operating results. Operating results were also positively impacted by strong export sales, which led to increased sales volumes. Operating results were negatively impacted by higher operating costs as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2007. Operating results for the nine months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $4 million related to impairment of packaging equipment.
 
Prepared Foods (10.0% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2008)
Prepared Foods segment sales were $683 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating income was $6 million and $58 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. Operating results as compared to the same periods in 2007 were negatively impacted by lower average sales prices.
