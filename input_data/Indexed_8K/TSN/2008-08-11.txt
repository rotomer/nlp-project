Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On August 6, 2008, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiary Tyson Receivables Corporation entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Company's Receivables Purchase Agreement (the "RPA Amendment") and an amendment and restatement of the Company's Receivables Transfer Agreement (the "Amended RTA" and collectively with the RPA Amendment, the "Amendments"). Under the terms of the Amendments, the Company renewed its 364-day facility and agreed to replace the remaining two years of its existing 3-year facility with a new 2-year commitment in the form of a 364-day facility and a commitment from the lenders thereunder to fund an account for any unused portion of the facility at the end of such 364-day period (if the 364-day facility is not renewed) which will provide financing to the Company through August 2010 by virtue of certain term-out mechanics. The Amendments also adjusted the pricing for borrowings under the facilities.
The foregoing descriptions of the Amended RTA and the RPA Amendment are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Amended RTA and the RPA Amendment which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 2.01.
Facility; Termination.
On the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto establish a receivables financing facility ("Program") consisting of a renewable 364-day facility ("
Facility A
") and another renewable 364-day facility ("
Facility B
").
The Committed Purchasers' several obligations to make purchases from the Transferor hereunder shall terminate under each Facility on the applicable Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the other Transaction Documents,
(a) no Committed Purchaser shall be obligated to provide the Transferor with funds (i) in an amount that would exceed such Committed Purchaser's unused Commitment then in effect or (ii) for a Tranche Period that would extend beyond the applicable Commitment Expiry Date, subject to Section 2.02(a)(iv) and in the case of Facility A to Section 2.03(a), and
(b) the failure of any Committed Purchaser to make its Commitment Pro Rata Share of such purchase available to the Transferor (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein) shall not relieve any other Committed Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained herein, to the extent that any Committed Purchaser fails to agree to an extension of the Facility B Commitment Expiry Date in accordance with Section 2.26(b) hereof, (i) such Committed Purchaser shall fund such Committed Purchaser's Facility Pro Rata Share with respect to Facility B of the Transfer Price for each Transferred Interest solely by accepting a Term-out Period Account Funded Incremental Transfer and (ii) no CP Conduit in such Committed Purchaser's Related Group shall accept any Incremental Transfers with respect to Facility B after the then existing Facility B Commitment Expiry Date.
SECTION 2.02.
Transfers; Certificates; Eligible Receivables.
(a)
Incremental Transfers.
Prior to the Termination Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the other Transaction Documents,
(x) the Transferor may, at its option from time to time, request a conveyance, transfer and assignment to each CP Conduit Purchaser (prior to the occurrence of a CP Conduit Purchaser's Termination Event with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser) or if
 
2
 
any CP Conduit Purchaser does not make such purchase, to the Committed Purchaser(s) in such CP Conduit Purchaser's Related Group; and
(y) each CP Conduit Purchaser may, at its option from time to time (prior to the occurrence of a CP Conduit Purchaser's Termination Event with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser), and if any CP Conduit Purchaser does not make such purchase, the Committed Purchaser(s) in such CP Conduit Purchaser's Related Group shall, accept such conveyance, transfer and assignment from the Transferor, without recourse except as provided herein,
of undivided percentage ownership interests in the Receivables, together with Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto (each, an "
Incremental Transfer
") at the Transfer Price from time to time prior to the Termination Date;
provided
that
(i) after giving effect to the issuance of Commercial Paper by the CP Conduit Purchasers or the obtaining of funds by the Committed Purchasers to fund the Transfer Price of any Incremental Transfer and the payment to the Transferor of such Transfer Price, the Net Investment shall not exceed the Program Limit;
(ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.01 shall be true and correct as of the date of such Incremental Transfer and the payment to the Transferor of the Transfer Price related thereto;
(iii) a portion of each Tranche of such Incremental Transfer shall be allocated to each Related Group according to its Commitment Pro Rata Share; and
(iv) each Related Group's portion of such Tranche will be allocated to such Related Group's Facility A and Facility B according to such Related Group's applicable Facility Pro Rata Share;
provided
,
however
, that if allocating such portion of such Tranche according to the applicable Facility Pro Rata Share would result in (x) a Tranche Period that extends beyond the Facility A Commitment Expiry Date being allocated to Facility A of such Related Group or (y) a Tranche Period that extends beyond the Facility B Commitment Expiry Date being allocated to Facility B of such Related Group, such Tranche Period, to the extent it applies to Facility A of such Related Group or Facility B of such Related Group, as applicable, will be deemed to end on the Facility A Commitment Expiry Date or the Facility B Commitment Expiry Date, as applicable.
The Transferor may, by delivery of a Transfer/Tranche Period Request to the Administrative Agent and each Funding Agent by telecopy, offer to convey, transfer and assign to each CP Conduit Purchaser (prior to the occurrence of a CP Conduit Purchaser's Termination Event with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser) or if any CP Conduit Purchaser does not make such purchase, to the Committed Purchaser(s) in such CP Conduit Purchaser's Related Group, undivided percentage ownership interests in the Receivables and Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto at least two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed date of any Incremental Transfer. Each such notice shall specify (x) the desired Transfer Price (which shall be at least $3,000,000 in the aggregate, or integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof) or, to the extent that the then available unused portion of the Program Limit is less than such
 
3
 
amount, such lesser amount equal to such available portion of the Program Limit; (y) the desired date of such Incremental Transfer which shall be a Business Day; and (z) the desired Tranche Period(s) and allocations of the Net Investment of such Incremental Transfer thereto as required by Section 2.03 hereof. Each Incremental Transfer shall be subject to the condition precedent that the Collection Agent shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to each Funding Agent, the most recently completed Settlement Statement (and to the extent required by Section 5.01(a)(ix), a completed Weekly Report dated within five (5) Business Days prior to the desired date of such Incremental Transfer), together with such other additional information as any Funding Agent may reasonably request. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Funding Agent for each CP Conduit Purchaser and the Committed Purchasers, as applicable, of the Administrative Agent's receipt of any request for an Incremental Transfer to be made to such Person. At their option, each CP Conduit Purchaser shall accept or reject any such offer by prompt written notice given to the Transferor, the Administrative Agent and the Funding Agent with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser by telephone or telecopy.
Each notice of proposed Incremental Transfer shall be irrevocable and binding on the Transferor, and the Transferor shall indemnify the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers against any loss or expense incurred by the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, either directly or indirectly, as a result of any failure by the Transferor to complete such Incremental Transfer, including, without limitation, any loss or expense incurred by the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds acquired by the CP Conduit Purchasers or the Committed Purchasers (including, without limitation, funds obtained by issuing Commercial Paper or promissory notes, obtaining deposits as loans from third parties and reemployment of funds) to fund such Incremental Transfer.
On the date of the initial Incremental Transfer, each Funding Agent, on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers in its Related Group, shall deliver written confirmation to the Transferor of the Transfer Price, the Tranche Period(s) and the Tranche Rate(s) relating to such Transfer as required by Section 2.03 hereof, and the Transferor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the Transfer Certificate in the form of Exhibit E hereto (the "
Transfer Certificate
"). The Transfer Price for the initial Incremental Transfer shall be $702,000,000. The Administrative Agent shall indicate the amount of the initial Incremental Transfer together with the date thereof on the grid attached to the Transfer Certificate;
provided
,
however
, that the failure by the Administrative Agent to make the foregoing notations shall not in any way affect the Transferor's obligations hereunder. On the date of each subsequent Incremental Transfer, each Funding Agent shall send written confirmation to the Transferor of the Transfer Price, the Tranche Period(s), the Transfer Date and the Tranche Rate(s) applicable to such Incremental Transfer. The Administrative Agent shall indicate the amount of the Incremental Transfer together with the date thereof as well as the Net Investment (after giving effect to the Incremental Transfer) on the grid attached to the Transfer Certificate. The Transfer Certificate shall evidence the Incremental Transfers. On the day of each Incremental Transfer, each CP Conduit Purchaser and Committed Purchaser participating in such purchase shall deposit to the Transferor's account, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to its share of the Transfer Price for such Incremental Transfer made to the CP Conduit Purchasers or the
 
4
 
Committed Purchasers, as applicable. No Committed Purchaser shall have any responsibility for the failure of any other Committed Purchaser to make any such deposit.
(b)
Reinvestment Transfers.
On each Business Day occurring after the initial Incremental Transfer hereunder and prior to a CP Conduit Purchaser's Termination Event (in the case of the CP Conduit Purchasers) and the Termination Date, the Transferor hereby agrees to convey, transfer and assign to each CP Conduit Purchaser (prior to the occurrence of a CP Conduit Purchaser's Termination Event with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser) or the Committed Purchasers, and each CP Conduit Purchaser may agree to purchase and, if such CP Conduit Purchaser does not so purchase, each Committed Purchaser in its Related Group shall purchase from the Transferor, undivided percentage ownership interests in each and every Receivable, together with Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto, to the extent that Collections are available for such Transfer in accordance with Section 2.05 hereof. The Transferor agrees to maintain, at all times prior to the Termination Date, a Net Receivables Balance in an amount at least sufficient to maintain the Percentage Factor at an amount not greater than the Maximum Percentage Factor pursuant to Section 2.06. Accordingly, the maximum amount of funding that the Transferor may obtain on the Closing Date or at any time thereafter shall be equal to the maximum Net Investment that would not exceed the Program Limit and would not cause the Percentage Factor to exceed the Maximum Percentage Factor.
(c)
All Transfers.
Each Transfer shall constitute a purchase of undivided percentage ownership interests in each and every Receivable, together with Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto, then existing, as well as in each and every Receivable, together with Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto, which arises at any time after the date of such Transfer. The CP Conduit Purchasers' (and, following the occurrence of a CP Conduit Purchaser's Termination Event with respect to any CP Conduit Purchaser, the Committed Purchaser(s) in its Related Group) aggregate undivided percentage ownership interest in the Receivables, together with the Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto, shall equal the Percentage Factor in effect from time to time. By accepting any conveyance, transfer and assignment of ownership interests in the Receivables hereunder, none of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers, the Funding Agents or the Administrative Agent assumes or shall have any obligations or liability under any of the applicable Contracts, all of which shall remain the obligations and liabilities of the Sellers. Such purchases from the Transferor by the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers shall be made in accordance with their respective Commitment Pro Rata Shares.
(d)
Percentage Factor.
The Percentage Factor shall be initially computed as of the opening of business of the Collection Agent on the date of the initial Incremental Transfer hereunder. Thereafter, until the Termination Date, the Percentage Factor shall be automatically recomputed as of the close of business of the Collection Agent on each Business Day and on each Saturday on which the Collection Agent is open until the Termination Date. The Percentage Factor shall remain constant from the time as of which any such computation or recomputation is made until the time as of which the next such recomputation, if any, shall be made. At all times on and after the Termination Date until the date on which the Net Investment has been reduced to zero, all Term-out Period Advances have been repaid in full and all accrued Discount, Servicing Fees and all other Aggregate Unpaids have been paid in full, the Percentage Factor shall equal 100%. Following any assignment of any portion of the Transferred Interest to
 
5
 
the Committed Purchasers in any Related Group pursuant to the relevant Asset Purchase Agreement, the Funding Agent for such Related Group shall, at all times and from time to time, calculate such CP Conduit Purchaser's and such Committed Purchaser's pro rata interest in the Percentage Factor and regularly report thereon to the Administrative Agent (with copies thereof to the Transferor).
SECTION 2.03.
Selection of Tranche Periods and Tranche Rates.
(a)
Transferred Interest Held by CP Conduit Purchasers Prior to CP Conduit Purchaser's Termination Event.
At all times hereafter, but prior to the Termination Date and not with respect to any portion of the Transferred Interest held by any of the Committed Purchasers, the Transferor may, subject to each Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser's approval and the limitations described below, request Tranche Periods and allocate a portion of the Net Investment to each selected Tranche Period, so that the aggregate amounts allocated to outstanding Tranche Periods at all times shall equal the portion of the Net Investment held by the Match Funding CP Conduit Purchasers. Each Related Group's portion of each applicable Tranche will be allocated to such Related Group's Facility A and Facility B according to such Related Group's applicable Facility Pro Rata Share;
provided
,
however
, that if allocating such portion of such Tranche according to the applicable Facility Pro Rata Share would result in a Tranche Period that extends beyond the Facility A Commitment Expiry Date being allocated to Facility A of such Related Group, such Tranche Period, to the extent it applies to Facility A of such Related Group, will be deemed to end on the Facility A Commitment Expiry Date. The Transferor may, by delivery of a Transfer/Tranche Period Request by telecopy to the Administrative Agent and the Funding Agent with respect to any Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the expiration of any then existing Tranche Period, request new Tranche Period(s) with respect to the relevant Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser;
provided
,
however
, that each Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser may select, in its sole discretion, any such new Tranche Period if (i) the Transferor fails to provide such notice on a timely basis or (ii) the Funding Agent with respect to such Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser, on behalf of such Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser, determines, in its sole discretion, that the Tranche Period requested by the Transferor is unavailable or for any reason commercially undesirable. Each Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser confirms that it is its intention to allocate all or substantially all of the portion of the Net Investment held by it to one or more CP Tranche Periods;
provided
that each Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser may determine, from time to time, in its sole discretion, that funding such portion of the Net Investment by means of one or more CP Tranche Periods is not possible or is not desirable for any reason.
On any Business Day, a Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser may elect that the Transferor no longer be permitted to select CP Tranches in accordance with the preceding paragraph in respect of the CP Conduit Funded Amount with respect to such Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser by giving the Transferor and the Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice thereof, which notice must be received by the Transferor and the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day prior to such election becoming effective. On any Business Day, a Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser may elect thereafter to allow the Transferor to select CP Tranches in accordance with the preceding paragraph in respect of the CP Conduit Funded Amount with respect to such Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser by giving the Transferor and
 
6
 
the Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice thereof, which notice must be received by the Transferor and the Administrative Agent at least two (2) Business Days prior to such Business Day. Any CP Conduit Purchaser making an election to change the manner in which its funding costs are allocated will be both a Match Funding CP Conduit Purchaser and a Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser during the period that its CP Conduit Funded Amount is funded on both a "pooled" and "match funded" basis and its accrued and unpaid Discount will be calculated accordingly. For all purposes of this Agreement, the "CP Tranche" with respect to any Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser shall be equal to the aggregate amount of its CP Conduit Funded Amount funded on a pooled basis during the related CP Tranche Period.
(b)
Transferred Interest Held by CP Conduit Purchasers Following the Termination Date.
At all times on and after the Termination Date, with respect to any portion of the Transferred Interest which shall not have been transferred to the Committed Purchasers (or any of them), each CP Conduit Purchaser or the Funding Agent with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser, as applicable, shall select all Tranche Periods (not to exceed 45 days) and Tranche Rates applicable thereto upon the expiration of Tranche Periods in effect on the Termination Date.
(c)
Transferred Interest Held by the Committed Purchasers or Liquidity Provider Prior to the Termination Date.
With respect to any portion of the Transferred Interest which is owned by or transferred to a Committed Purchaser or Liquidity Provider pursuant to this Agreement or an Asset Purchase Agreement prior to the Termination Date, the initial Tranche Period applicable to such portion of the Net Investment allocable thereto shall be a period of at least three (3) Business Days, and such Tranche shall be a BR Tranche. Thereafter (but prior to the Termination Date), with respect to such portion, and with respect to any other portion of the Transferred Interest held by or transferred to any Committed Purchaser or Liquidity Provider, the Tranche Period applicable thereto shall be, at the Transferor's sole option, either a BR Tranche or a Eurodollar Tranche. The Transferor may, by delivery of a Transfer/Tranche Period Request by telecopy to the Administrative Agent and the Funding Agents with respect to any Committed Purchaser (i) if the applicable Tranche is to be a Eurodollar Tranche, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the expiration of any then existing Tranche Period, and (ii) if the applicable Tranche is to be a BR Tranche, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the expiration of any then existing Tranche Period, request new Tranche Period(s) with respect to such Committed Purchaser or Liquidity Provider. Any Tranche Period maintained by the Committed Purchasers which is outstanding on the Termination Date shall end on the Termination Date.
(d)
After the Termination Date; Transferred Interest Held by or Transferred to Committed Purchasers or Liquidity Providers.
At all times on and after the Termination Date, with respect to any portion of the Transferred Interest which shall have been owned by, or transferred to, the Committed Purchaser or Liquidity Provider, the Funding Agents of the applicable Committed Purchaser or Liquidity Provider shall select all Tranche Periods and Tranche Rates applicable thereto upon the expiration of Tranche Periods in effect on the Termination Date.
(e)
Term-out Period Advances Made Prior to the Termination Date.
With respect to any portion of a Term-out Period Advance which is made by a Nonrenewing Committed Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement prior to the Termination Date, the initial Tranche Period
 
7
 
applicable to such portion shall be either (i) at the Transferor's sole option, either a Eurodollar Tranche or a BR Tranche if so specified in the written request for such Term-out Period Advance delivered pursuant to Section 2.26(c) and if such request is delivered at least three (3) days prior to such initial Tranche Period or (ii) if not so specified, a period of at least three (3) days, and such Tranche shall be a BR Tranche. Thereafter (but prior to the Termination Date), with respect to any portion of such Term-out Period Advance, the Tranche Period applicable thereto shall be, at the Transferor's sole option, either a Eurodollar Tranche or a BR Tranche. The Transferor shall give the Administrative Agent and the Funding Agents with respect to the applicable Nonrenewing Committed Purchasers irrevocable notice by telephone of the new Tranche Period at least three (3) Business Days prior to the expiration of any then existing Tranche Period. Any Tranche Period maintained by the Nonrenewing Committed Purchasers which is outstanding on the Termination Date shall end on the Termination Date.
(f)
After the Termination Date; Term-out Period Advances Made by Nonrenewing Committed Purchasers.
At all times on and after the Termination Date, with respect to any Term-out Period Advances which shall have been made by the Nonrenewing Committed Purchasers, the Funding Agents with respect to the applicable Nonrenewing Committed Purchasers shall select all Tranche Periods and Tranche Rates applicable thereto upon the expiration of Tranche Periods in effect on the Termination Date.
(g) Nieuw Amsterdam may at any time designate all or any portion of the Net Investment held by it as a "CP Conduit Purchaser" as having been transferred to itself in its capacity as a "Committed Purchaser", to the same extent and with the same effect as if such transfer had been made to a third party Committed Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or an Asset Purchase Agreement.
SECTION 2.04.
Discount, Fees and Other Costs and Expenses.
Notwithstanding the limitation on recourse under Section 2.01 hereof, the Transferor shall pay, as and when due in accordance with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, all Discount, Servicing Fees, Fees and other Aggregate Unpaids to the extent not otherwise provided for by the provisions of this Agreement. As provided in Section 2.05 and 2.06, the Transferor shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers, as applicable, an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Discount for such Tranche Period together with, in the event any portion of the Transferred Interest is held by the CP Conduit Purchasers, an amount equal to the Discount (without duplication) accrued on the CP Conduit Purchasers' Commercial Paper to the extent such Commercial Paper was issued in order to fund the Transferred Interest in a face amount in excess of the Transfer Price of an Incremental Transfer;
provided
that (i) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of a BR Tranche or a Eurodollar Tranche, accrued Discount on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (ii) in the event of any conversion of a BR Tranche or a Eurodollar Tranche, accrued interest on such BR Tranche or Eurodollar Tranche shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. Discount shall accrue with respect to each Tranche on each day occurring during the Tranche Period related thereto.
Nothing in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents shall limit in any way the obligations of the Transferor to pay the amounts set forth in this Section 2.04.

SECTION 2.05.
Non-Liquidation Settlement and Reinvestment
Procedures.
(a) On each day after the date of any Incremental Transfer but prior to the Termination Date, and provided that Section 2.06 shall not be applicable, the Collection Agent shall, out of the Percentage Factor of Collections received on or prior to such day and not previously set aside or paid:
(i) set aside and hold in trust for the CP Conduit Purchasers or the Committed Purchasers, as applicable an amount equal to all Discount, Fees and the Servicing Fee accrued through such day and not so previously set aside or paid;
(ii) apply the balance of such Percentage Factor of Collections remaining after application of Collections as provided in clause (i) of this Section 2.05 to the Transferor, for the benefit of the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers, as applicable, to the purchase of additional undivided percentage interests in each Receivable pursuant to Section 2.02(b) hereof; and
(iii) remit the balance, if any, of Collections remaining after the applications provided in clauses (i) and (ii) to the Transferor or its designee.
(b) On each Settlement Date (or during a Downgrade Condition, on each Weekly Settlement Date), from the amounts set aside as described in clause (a) (i) of this Section 2.05, the Collection Agent shall deposit to the Collection Account, for the benefit of the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers, as applicable, an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Discount and Fees for the related Settlement Period (or during a Downgrade Condition, for the period since the end of the preceding Settlement Period or for the preceding calendar week) and shall deposit to its own account an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee for such Settlement Period (or calendar week, as applicable);
provided
that (i) accrued and unpaid Discount with respect to any Eurodollar Tranche shall be deposited at the end of the related Tranche Period, and (ii) at the end of each Eurodollar Tranche Period, the Administrative Agent shall distribute from such amounts deposited into the Collection Account to the Funding Agents for the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchaser the amount of accrued and unpaid Discount for such Eurodollar Tranche Period, as calculated by the Funding Agents in accordance with the Transaction Documents. On each Settlement Date (or during a Downgrade Condition, on each Weekly Settlement Date), the Administrative Agent shall distribute from such amounts deposited into the Collection Account to the Funding Agents for the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers the amount of accrued and unpaid Discount and Fees for such preceding Settlement Period (or during a Downgrade Condition, for the period since the end of the preceding Settlement Period or for the preceding calendar week, as applicable) as calculated by the Funding Agents in accordance with the Transaction Documents;
provided
that if the Administrative Agent shall have insufficient funds to pay all of the above amounts in full on any such date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Transferor and the Transferor shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent, from funds previously paid to the Transferor, an amount equal to such insufficiency. The Administrative Agent shall pay the Funding Agents in accordance with the records maintained by the Funding Agents pursuant to Section 2.24;
provided
that earnings on any Permitted Investments in a Committed Purchaser's Term-out Period Account shall be applied to offset the Discount payable to such Committed Purchaser on any date upon which Discount is payable to such Committed Purchaser.

SECTION 2.06.
Liquidation Settlement Procedures.
(a) If at any time on or prior to the Termination Date, the Percentage Factor is greater than the Maximum Percentage Factor, then the Collection Agent shall immediately pay to each Funding Agent, for the benefit of the relevant CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers, as applicable, from previously received Collections, an amount that, when applied to reduce the Net Investment will result in a Percentage Factor less than or equal to the Maximum Percentage Factor, to be allocated to each Related Group based on its Commitment Pro Rata Share and, within each Related Group, to each Facility based on the applicable Facility Pro Rata Share.

(iv)
fourth
, apply the balance of such Collections to the purchase of additional undivided percentage interests pursuant to Section 2.02 (b) hereof.

(d) Following the date on which the Net Investment has been reduced to zero, all Term-out Period Advances have been paid in full and all accrued Discount, Fees, Servicing Fees and all other Aggregate Unpaids have been paid in full, (i) the Percentage Factor shall equal zero, (ii) the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, shall be considered to have reconveyed to the Transferor all of the CP Conduit Purchasers' and the Committed Purchasers' right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables and Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto, and (iii) the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, shall execute and deliver to the Transferor, at the Transferor's expense, such documents or instruments as are necessary to terminate the CP Conduit Purchasers' and the Committed Purchasers' respective interests in the Receivables and Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto.

Upon the date specified in such Reduction Notice for such reduction, the Transferor shall immediately pay to
 
11
 
the relevant Funding Agent, for the benefit of the applicable CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers, as applicable, from previously received Collections, an amount equal to the Commitment Pro Rata Share of the applicable Related Group of such targeted reduction, to be allocated within such Related Group to each Facility based on the applicable Facility Pro Rata Share.

Upon any such reduction or repayment, the Commitment of each Committed Purchaser shall be reduced, and the Term-out Period Advance of each Committed Purchaser shall be repaid, in an amount equal to such Committed Purchaser's Commitment Pro Rata Share of the amount of such reduction or repayment, and the Program Limit shall be recalculated to equal 98.04% of the sum of the Aggregate Commitment and the Nonrenewing Amounts of all Committed Purchasers. Once reduced, the Commitments shall not be subsequently reinstated and once repaid, the Term-out Period Advances may not be reborrowed. The Commitment of each Committed Purchaser shall be automatically reduced to zero on its Commitment Expiry Date and the Commitment of all Committed Purchasers shall be automatically reduced to zero on the Termination Date.

The Transferor shall, and will cause the Sellers to, upon request of any Funding Agent, obtain such additional search reports as any Funding Agent, for the benefit of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, shall reasonably request. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Administrative Agent shall be permitted to sign and file
 
12
 
continuation statements and amendments thereto and assignments thereof without the Transferor's or any Seller's signature. Carbon, photostatic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement shall be sufficient as a financing statement. The Transferor shall not, and shall not permit any Seller to, change its respective name (within the meaning of Section 9-507(c) of the Relevant UCC), jurisdiction of organization, form of organization, taxpayer identification number or state organizational number, unless it shall have: (i) given the Administrative Agent at least thirty (30) days' prior notice thereof and (ii) prepared at the Transferor's expense and delivered to the Administrative Agent all financing statements, instruments and other documents necessary to preserve and protect the Transferred Interest and the Term-out Period Accounts or requested by any Funding Agent in connection with such change.

The Collection Agent shall not add any bank as a Lockbox Bank to those listed on Exhibit B attached hereto unless such bank has entered into a Lockbox Agreement. The Collection Agent shall not terminate any bank as a Lockbox Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received sixty (60) days' prior notice of such termination. If the Transferor, any Seller or the Collection Agent receives any Collections, the Transferor or the Collection Agent, as applicable, shall, or shall cause such Seller to, remit such Collections to a Lockbox Account within one (1) Business Day of receipt thereof.
(c) The Transferor hereby pledges, assigns and transfers to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, and hereby creates and grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, a security interest in the Lockbox Accounts and all cash, checks and other negotiable instruments, funds and other evidences of payment held therein.
SECTION 2.10.

(a) If on any day a Receivable becomes a Diluted Receivable, the Transferor shall be deemed to have received on such day a Collection of such Receivable in the amount of the applicable reduction or cancellation, and the Transferor shall pay to the Collection Agent an amount equal to such reduction or cancellation. Any such amount shall be applied by the Collection Agent as a Collection in accordance with Section 2.05 or 2.06 hereof, as applicable.
(b) If on any day any of the representations or warranties in Article III was or becomes untrue with respect to a Receivable or the nature of the Administrative Agent's interest therein (whether on or after the date of any transfer of an interest therein to the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, or an assignment therein by the CP Conduit Purchasers to the Committed Purchasers under the Asset Purchase Agreements), the Transferor shall be deemed to have received on such day a Collection of such Receivable in full and the Transferor shall, on such day, pay to the Collection Agent an amount equal to the Outstanding
 
13
 
Balance of such Receivable and such amount shall be allocated and applied by the Collection Agent as a Collection allocable to the Transferred Interest in accordance with Section 2.05 or 2.06 hereof, as applicable. Simultaneously with any such payment by the Transferor, each of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, as the case may be, shall convey all of its right, title and interest in such Receivable and Related Security to the Transferor, and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers, shall take all action reasonably requested by the Transferor to effectuate such conveyance.
(c) Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to the Transferor or the Seller shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor included in the Transferred Interest (in order of the age of such Receivable, starting with the oldest such Receivable), except as otherwise instructed by the Administrative Agent and the Required Committed Purchasers, to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other indebtedness of such Obligor.

No later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of any Incremental Transfer hereunder, the CP Conduit Purchasers or the Committed Purchasers, as applicable, will make available to the Transferor, in immediately available funds, the Transfer Price for such Incremental Transfer on such day by remitting such amount to an account of the Transferor specified in the related Transfer/Tranche Period Request (or otherwise specified by the Transferor by written notice to the Administrative Agent),
provided
that any portion of the Transfer Price with respect to Facility B to be paid by any Nonrenewing Committed Purchaser shall be funded solely by a withdrawal from such Nonrenewing Committed Purchaser's Term-out Period Account as provided in Section 2.01. The Transferor shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers upon demand, interest on all amounts not paid or deposited by it when due under this Section 2.11 at a rate equal to 2.00% per annum plus the Base Rate. All computations of interest hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed. Whenever any payment or deposit to be made hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment or deposit shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of such payment or deposit. Any computations by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Funding Agent of amounts payable by the Transferor hereunder shall be binding upon the Transferor absent manifest error.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Termination Event, the Collection Agent, at the direction of the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of the Required Committed Purchasers, shall remit daily to the Collection Account all Collections received with respect to any Receivables as provided in Section 2.06(c).

SECTION 2.15.

If any CP Conduit Purchaser or any Committed Purchaser (for purposes of this Section 2.15 only, a "
Recipient
") shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of any interest in the Transferred Interest owned by it or its Term-out Period Advance in excess of its Commitment Pro Rata Share of payments on account of any interest in the Transferred Interest or its Term-out Period Advance obtained by the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers entitled thereto, such Recipient shall forthwith purchase from the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or the Committed Purchasers entitled to a share of such amount participations in the percentage interests owned by such Persons as shall be necessary to cause such Recipient to share the excess payment ratably with each such other Person entitled thereto;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such Recipient, such purchase from each such other Person shall be rescinded and each such other Person shall repay to the Recipient the purchase price paid by such Recipient for such participation to the extent of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such other Person's Commitment Pro Rata Share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such other Person's required payment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the Recipient) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the Recipient in respect of the total amount so recovered.
SECTION 2.16.
Broken Funding.
In the event that (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Tranche is made other than on the last day of the Eurodollar Tranche Period applicable thereto (including as a result of the occurrence of the Termination Date or an optional prepayment by the Transferor of a Eurodollar Tranche), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Tranche is made by the Transferor other than on the last day of the related Eurodollar Tranche Period, or (c) the Transferor fails to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar
 
16
 
Tranche on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, then, in any such event, the Transferor shall compensate the Committed Purchasers for the loss, cost and expense actually incurred by such Committed Purchasers attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Committed Purchaser shall include an amount determined by such Committed Purchaser to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of Discount which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Eurodollar Tranche had such event not occurred, at the Eurodollar Rate that would have been applicable to such Eurodollar Tranche, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the Eurodollar Tranche Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the related Eurodollar Tranche Period), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Committed Purchaser would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. Within forty-five (45) days after any Committed Purchaser hereunder receives actual knowledge of any of the events specified in this Section 2.16, a certificate of such Committed Purchaser setting forth any amount or amounts that such Committed Purchaser is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 and the reason(s) therefor shall be delivered to the Transferor (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Transferor shall pay each such Committed Purchaser the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17.
Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Tranches Funded by the Committed Purchasers.
Prior to the occurrence of the Termination Date, (a) each BR Tranche hereunder may, at the option of the Transferor, be continued as a BR Tranche or converted to a Eurodollar Tranche and (b) each Eurodollar Tranche may, at the option of the Transferor, be continued as a Eurodollar Tranche or converted to a BR Tranche. On and after the Termination Date (i) no outstanding Tranche funded by the Committed Purchasers may be converted to, or continued as, a Eurodollar Tranche and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Tranche shall be converted to a BR Tranche on the last day of the Tranche Period related thereto. For any such optional conversion or continuation by the Transferor, the Transferor shall give each Funding Agent irrevocable notice (each, a "
Conversion/Continuation Notice
") of such request not later than 12:30 p.m. (New York City time) in the case of a conversion of a BR Tranche into a Eurodollar Tranche, or a continuation of a Eurodollar Tranche as a Eurodollar Tranche, three (3) Business Days before the date of such conversion or continuation, as applicable. If a Conversion/Continuation Notice has not been timely delivered with respect to any BR Tranche or Eurodollar Tranche, such Tranche shall be automatically continued as, or converted to, a BR Tranche. Each Conversion/Continuation Notice shall specify (a) the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) of such conversion or continuation, (b) the aggregate amount and rate option applicable to the Tranche which is to be converted or continued and (c) the amount and rate option(s) of Tranche(s) into which such Tranche is to be converted or continued.
SECTION 2.18.
Illegality.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if, after the Closing Date, the adoption of any Law or bank regulatory guideline or any amendment or change in the interpretation of any existing or future Law or bank regulatory guideline by any Official Body charged with the administration, interpretation or application thereof, or the compliance with any directive of any Official Body (in the case of any bank regulatory guideline, whether or not having the force of Law), shall make it unlawful for any Committed Purchaser to
 
17
 
acquire or maintain a Eurodollar Tranche as contemplated by this Agreement, (i) such Committed Purchaser shall, within forty-five (45) days after receiving actual knowledge thereof, deliver a certificate to the Transferor (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) setting forth the basis for such illegality, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error, (ii) the commitment of such Committed Purchaser hereunder to make a portion of a Eurodollar Tranche, continue any portion of a Eurodollar Tranche as such and convert a BR Tranche to a Eurodollar Tranche shall forthwith be canceled, and such cancellation shall remain in effect so long as the circumstance described above exists, and (iii) such Committed Purchaser's portion of any Eurodollar Tranche then outstanding shall be converted automatically to a BR Tranche on the last day of the related Eurodollar Tranche Period, or within such earlier period as required by law.
If any such conversion of a portion of a Eurodollar Tranche occurs on a day which is not the last day of the related Eurodollar Tranche Period, then pursuant to Section 2.16 the Transferor shall pay to such Committed Purchaser such amounts, if any, as may be required to compensate such Committed Purchaser. If circumstances subsequently change so that it is no longer unlawful for an affected Committed Purchaser to acquire or to maintain a portion of a Eurodollar Tranche as contemplated hereunder, such Committed Purchaser will, as soon as reasonably practicable after such Committed Purchaser knows of such change in circumstances, notify the Transferor and the Administrative Agent, and upon receipt of such notice, the obligations of such Committed Purchaser to acquire or maintain its acquisition of portions of Eurodollar Tranches or to convert its portion of a BR Tranche into portions of Eurodollar Tranches shall be reinstated.
(b) Each Committed Purchaser agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.18(a) with respect to such Committed Purchaser, it will, if requested by the Transferor and to the extent permitted by law or by the relevant Official Body, endeavor in good faith to change the office at which it books its portions of Eurodollar Tranches hereunder if such change would make it lawful for such Committed Purchasers to continue to acquire or to maintain its acquisition of portions of Eurodollar Tranches hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that such change may be made in such manner that such Committed Purchaser, in its sole determination, suffers no unreimbursed cost or expense or any other disadvantage whatsoever.
SECTION 2.19.
Inability to Determine Eurodollar Rate.
If, prior to the first day of any Eurodollar Tranche Period:
(a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination in the absence of manifest error shall be conclusive and binding upon the Transferor) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, either (i) dollar deposits in the relevant amounts and for the relevant Tranche Period are not available, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Tranche Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Committed Purchasers that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Eurodollar Tranche Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
 
18
 
Committed Purchasers (as conclusively certified by such Committed Purchasers) of purchasing or maintaining their affected portions of Eurodollar Tranches during such Eurodollar Tranche Period;
then, in either such event, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof (confirmed in writing) to the Transferor and the Committed Purchasers as soon as practicable (but, in any event, within ten (10) days after such determination or notice, as applicable) thereafter. Following delivery of such notice to the Transferor, no further Eurodollar Tranches shall be made. The Administrative Agent agrees to withdraw any such notice as soon as reasonably practicable after the Administrative Agent is notified of a change in circumstances which makes such notice inapplicable.
SECTION 2.20.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Transferor shall indemnify each Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts (without duplication of amounts for which any Indemnified Party is effectively held harmless under any other provision hereof) relating to or resulting from:

(d) the failure to file, or any delay in filing, financing statements, continuation statements, or other similar instruments or documents under the Relevant UCC or other applicable laws with respect to any of the Receivables or Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto;
(e) any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of any Receivable (including, without limitation, a defense based on such Receivable or the related Contract not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms), or any other claim resulting from the sale of merchandise or services related to such Receivable or the furnishing or failure to furnish such merchandise or services, or failure to diligently pursue the collection of any Receivable (if such collection activities were performed by the Transferor or any of its Affiliates acting as the Collection Agent);

unless, in the case of (ii) and (iii) above, any change in treaty, law regulation, governmental rule, guideline order, or official application or official interpretation thereof has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Indemnified Party from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it, and such Indemnified Party so advises the Transferor and the Administrative Agent. Each such Indemnified Party that is not a United States person (A) shall certify (i) in the case of an IRS Form W-8ECI, or successor applicable form, that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-9, or successor applicable form, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax and (B) shall agree to provide any other certification and documentation as required by the applicable law that is reasonably requested by the Transferor, the Sellers or the Collection Agent.

minus
(ii) the income, if any, received by such Funding Agent's related CP Conduit Purchaser and related Committed Purchaser from investing the funds received with respect to its Net Investment and Term-out Period Advances due to such replacement for the remainder of such Tranche Period.
(c) The Administrative Agent, at the request of any Funding Agent, will within forty-five (45) days after receipt of notice of any event occurring after the date hereof which will entitle an Indemnified Party to compensation pursuant to this Article II, notify the Transferor in writing of such event.

In determining such amount, the applicable Funding Agent or any applicable Indemnified Party may use any reasonable averaging and attributing methods.
(d) If the Transferor is required to pay any additional amount to any Committed Purchaser pursuant to Sections 2.21 or 2.22, then such Committed Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts (which shall not require such Committed Purchaser to incur an unreimbursed loss or unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise take any action inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions or suffer any disadvantage or burden reasonably deemed by it to be significant) (A) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Transferor or (B) to assign its rights and delegate and transfer its obligations hereunder to

27
 
Group, and cause such funds to be immediately applied to purchase the CP Conduit Purchaser's Transferred Interest of the CP Conduit Purchaser that is a member of such Nonrenewing Committed Purchaser's Related Group in accordance with the applicable Asset Purchase Agreement.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any CP Conduit Purchaser, any Committed Purchaser or any Funding Agent, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent; and (ii) in no event shall the Administrative Agent be liable under or in connection with this Agreement for indirect, special, or consequential losses or damages of any kind, including lost profits, even if advised of the possibility thereof and regardless of the form of action by which such losses or damages may be claimed. In performing its functions and duties hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as the agent of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers and the Funding Agents, and the Administrative Agent does not assume, nor shall be deemed to have assumed, any trust or fiduciary obligation or relationship with or for any such Person. Without limiting the foregoing, in accordance with customary practices in syndicated conduit financings, the Administrative Agent will promptly forward to each Funding Agent any written information delivered by or on behalf of the Transferor or Tyson to the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 8.02.
Delegation of Duties
. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel (who may be counsel for the Transferor or the Collection Agent), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.
SECTION 8.03.
Exculpatory Provisions
. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement (x) with the consent or at the request of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers or the Funding Agents or (y) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the
 
55
 
Committed Purchasers or the Funding Agents for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Transferor, the Collection Agent, the Sellers, any Agent Seller or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, the Receivables (or any Related Security, Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto) or any Transferred Interest or for any failure of any of the Transferor, the Collection Agent, the Sellers or any Agent Seller or the Obligors to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any CP Conduit Purchaser, any Committed Purchaser or any Funding Agent to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Transferor, the Collection Agent, any Seller or any Agent Seller.
SECTION 8.04.
Reliance by Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, fax, e-mail, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Transferor or to the Collection Agent), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Funding Agents, on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchasers, as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Funding Agents against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with a request of the Funding Agents, on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchasers (unless, in the case of any action relating to the giving of consent hereunder, the giving of such consent requires the consent of all the CP Conduit Purchasers), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers and the Funding Agents.
SECTION 8.05.
Notice of Collection Agent Default
. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Collection Agent Default or any Termination Event unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a CP Conduit Purchaser, a Committed Purchaser, a Funding Agent, the Transferor or the Collection Agent referring to this Agreement, describing such Collection Agent Default or Termination Event and stating that such notice is a "notice of a Collection Agent Default" or "notice of a Termination Event", as the case may be. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Funding Agents, the Transferor and the Collection Agent. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such event as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Committed Purchasers,
 
56
 
provided
that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such event as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the CP Conduit Purchasers and the Committed Purchasers.
SECTION 8.06.
Non-Reliance on the Administrative Agent and Other Purchasers
. Each of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers and the Funding Agents expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Transferor, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any such Person. Each of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers and the Funding Agents represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other CP Conduit Purchaser, Committed Purchaser or Funding Agent and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Transferor, the Collection Agent and the Sellers and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers and the Funding Agents also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other CP Conduit Purchaser, Committed Purchaser or Funding Agent, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Transferor, the Collection Agent and the Sellers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Funding Agents by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any CP Conduit Purchaser, any Committed Purchaser or any Funding Agent with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Transferor, the Collection Agent or the Sellers which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.
SECTION 8.07.
Indemnification
. Each of the Committed Purchasers, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Transferor, the Collection Agent and the Sellers and without limiting the obligation of the Transferor, the Collection Agent and the Sellers to do so) ratably in accordance with their respective Commitment Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided
that no Committed Purchaser shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
 
57
 
disbursements resulting solely from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of all amounts payable hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of Nieuw Amsterdam, as Committed Purchaser, under this Section 8.07 shall be the sole responsibility of Nieuw Amsterdam's Funding Agent and Nieuw Amsterdam will have no liability with respect hereto.
SECTION 8.08.
The Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity
. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Transferor, the Collection Agent or any of their Affiliates as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. With respect to any Transferred Interest held by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as any Purchaser and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Committed Purchaser," and "Purchaser" shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.
SECTION 8.09.
Resignation of Administrative Agent; Successor Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent at any time by giving 30 days' notice to the Funding Agents, the Transferor and the Collection Agent. The Administrative Agent may be removed at any time by a resolution of the Required Committed Purchasers, removing the Administrative Agent and appointing from among the Funding Agents a successor administrative agent, which successor administrative agent shall be approved by the Transferor and the Collection Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Collection Agent. If JPMCB shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, then the Required Committed Purchasers, shall promptly appoint a successor administrative agent from among the Funding Agents, which successor administrative agent shall be approved by the Transferor and the Collection Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Funding Agents, the Transferor and the Collection Agent, a successor agent from among the Funding Agents. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Collection Agent shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Committed Purchasers appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Effective upon the appointment of a successor administrative agent, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor administrative agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.
 
58
 
SECTION 8.10.
Consent to Agreed-Upon Procedures
. Each CP Conduit Purchaser, Committed Purchaser and Funding Agent, by becoming a party to this Agreement, authorizes the Administrative Agent (a) to execute on its behalf a letter agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit M hereto, with respect to the limited engagement of, and consenting to the agreed-upon procedures to be performed by, the certified public accountants of Tyson and its Subsidiaries on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the CP Conduit Purchasers, the Committed Purchasers and the Funding Agents in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents so long as such procedures are consistent with Sections 6.02(c) and 6.02(d); and (b) to approve additional agreed-upon procedures.
SECTION 8.11.
Authorization and Action of Funding Agents
. Each CP Conduit Purchaser and Committed Purchaser in a Related Group hereby appoints and authorizes the Funding Agent for such Related Group to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such power under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as are delegated to such Funding Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The CP Conduit Purchaser and Committed Purchasers in a Related Group may at any time appoint a new Funding Agent in accordance with the terms of the applicable Asset Purchase Agreement with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, such appointment to become effective on the date specified by such CP Conduit Purchaser in a written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Funding Agent hereunder by a successor Funding Agent, such successor Funding Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers and privileges, and subject to the duties, obligations and liabilities of, the departing Funding Agent, and the departing Funding Agent shall relinquish its rights, powers and privileges, and be discharged from its duties, obligations and liabilities, under this Agreement.

Obligations
"); p
rovided
that, such Obligations shall not include amounts not collected in respect of any Receivable as a result of the lack of creditworthiness of an Obligor, including, but not limited to, amounts required to be returned to an Obligor as a voidable preference. The Guarantor shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses including, without limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent and the other Beneficiaries in connection with (a) the collection of all or any part of the Obligations from the Guarantor and (b) the prosecution or defense of any action by or against the Administrative Agent, the other Beneficiaries or the Transferor in connection with, or relating to, the Obligations, whether involving the Sellers, the Collection Agent, the Guarantor, the Transferor or any other party (including, but not limited to, a trustee in a bankruptcy or a debtor-in-possession).
 
59
 
SECTION 9.02.
Validity of Obligations; Irrevocability.
The Guarantor agrees that subject to the proviso set forth in Section 9.01 above its obligations under this Limited Guaranty shall be unconditional, irrespective of (i) the validity, enforceability, discharge, disaffirmance, settlement or compromise (by any Person, including a trustee in a bankruptcy or a debtor-in-possession) of the Obligations or of the Transaction Documents or any Contract, (ii) the absence of any attempt to collect the Obligations from a Seller, a Agent Seller or the Collection Agent or any other party, (iii) the waiver or consent by any Person with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing the Obligations, (iv) any change of the time, manner or place of payment or performance, or any other term of any of the Obligations, (v) any law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction affecting any term of any of the Obligations or rights of any Person with respect thereto, (vi) the failure by any Person to take any steps to perfect and maintain perfected its interest in the Receivables or any security or collateral related to the Obligations or (vii) any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.

The Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent a payment is made by a Seller, any Agent Seller or the Collection Agent under the Transaction Documents, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to such Seller, such Agent Seller or the Collection Agent, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Obligation or part thereof which has been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the date such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction occurred. The Guarantor waives all set-offs, defenses and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for performance, notices of dishonor and notice of acceptance of this Limited Guaranty. The Guarantor agrees that its obligations under this Limited Guaranty shall be irrevocable.
SECTION 9.03.
Several Obligations

The Guarantor agrees that this Limited Guaranty shall not be discharged except by payment in full of the Obligations and complete performance of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected in any way by the release or discharge of a Seller from the performance of any of the Obligations (other than the full and final payment of all of the Obligations), whether occurring by reason of law or any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing.
SECTION 9.04.
Subrogation Rights
. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of subrogation rights relating to the Obligations at any time when all the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Beneficiaries, and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be applied to the Obligations. If (a) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Administrative Agent of or perform all or any part of the Obligations and (b) all the Obligations shall be paid and performed in full, the Administrative Agent will, at the Guarantor's request, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the
 
60
 
Guarantor of any interest in the Obligations resulting from such payment or performance by the Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby agrees that it shall have no rights of subrogation with respect to amounts due to the Administrative Agent or the Beneficiaries until such time as all obligations of the Sellers to the Transferor, the Administrative Agent and the Beneficiaries have been paid or performed in full and this Agreement has been terminated.
SECTION 9.05.
Rights of Set-Off
. The Guarantor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Beneficiaries, at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (whether general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Administrative Agent or the Beneficiaries to or for the credit or the account of the Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of the Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Limited Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby acknowledges that rights of the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Beneficiaries, described in this Section 9.05 are in addition to all other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) the Administrative Agent and the Beneficiaries may have.
