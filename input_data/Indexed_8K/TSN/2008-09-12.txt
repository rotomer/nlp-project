(c) Section 8.01 of the Credit Agreement is amended to (1) replace the reference to "the Borrower" in paragraph (b) thereof with a reference to "any Loan Party", (2) replace the first reference to "The Borrower" in paragraph (d) thereof with a reference to "Any Loan Party", and (3) delete the word "or" at the end of paragraph (j) thereof, to delete paragraph (k) thereof and to insert in its place the following:
(k)
Collateral Agreement
. At any time after the delivery of the Collateral Agreement, the Collateral Agreement shall not for any reason be, or shall be asserted by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable against the Subsidiary Guarantors in all material respects in accordance with its terms; or
(l)
Security Documents.
Any Lien purported to be created under any Security Document shall cease to be, or shall be asserted by any Loan Party or Trademark Owner not to be, a valid and perfected Lien on any material Collateral, with the priority required by the applicable Security Document, except (i) as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition of the applicable Collateral in a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or (ii) as a result of the Administrative Agent's failure to maintain possession of any stock certificate, promissory note or other instrument delivered to it under the Collateral Agreement.
(d) Exhibit 6.09 (Form of Compliance Certificate) is hereby amended to delete the "and" immediately preceding clause (c) of the second paragraph thereof, to replace the period at the end of such subclause (c) with the phrase "; and" and to insert immediately thereafter the following new subclause (d):
"(d) on the Computation Date, the aggregate book value of the inventory owned by the Subsidiary Guarantors was approximately (and in any event not less than) $_____________________."
