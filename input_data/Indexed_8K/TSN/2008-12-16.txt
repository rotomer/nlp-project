A substantial portion of the assets to be pledged by Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (TFM), a subsidiary of the Company, will also be pledged on a second priority basis to secure TFMs and the Companys obligations under TFMs outstanding 7.125% Notes due 2026 and 7.95% Notes due 2010 in accordance with the requirements of the indenture governing such notes.

(b) Interest Covenant  Under the terms of the Amendment, the threshold for the Companys interest coverage covenant under the Credit Agreement will be decreased to 2.85x for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2009 and restored to 3.00x, the current multiple, thereafter.
 
Pricing
. The reference rate spread and the LIBOR spread will each be increased by 80 basis points and the annual facility fee rate will be increased by 20 basis points. The Company will also incur a one-time amendment fee of $5.0 million to be paid to the lenders under the Credit Agreement who consent to the Amendment.
 
Amendment to Securitization Facility
 
As a result of the Amendment, the Company also entered into Amendment No. 1 to its Amended and Restated Receivables Transfer Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2008, as previously amended (the Receivables Amendment), with Tyson Receivables Corporation, the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, Suntrust Bank and Rabobank International (collectively, the Receivables Lenders), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the Receivables Lenders will give their consent to the modified financial covenants under the Amendment and (ii) pricing under the Receivables Agreement will be increased.

The Administrative Agent may grant extensions of time for the creation and perfection of security interests in or the obtaining of title insurance, legal opinions or other deliverables with respect to particular assets (including extensions beyond the Sixth Amendment Effective Date) where it determines that such actions cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which they would otherwise be required to be accomplished by this Agreement or the Security Documents.
