1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On March 9, 2009 (the "Closing Date"), Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") completed its previously announced offering of its 10.50% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes"). As part of the closing, the Company entered into an Indenture, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Indenture"), among the Company, substantially all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors (the "Guarantors"), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, and a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), among the Company, the Guarantors and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers (the "Initial Purchasers").
Also on the Closing Date, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, the Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital, Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., "Rabobank Nederland", New York Branch, as Joint Bookrunners and Joint Lead Arrangers, Bank of America, N.A. and Barclays Capital, as Co-Syndication Agents and Wachovia Bank, National Association and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., "Rabobank Nederland", New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of $1 billion. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured by a first lien position on certain of the Company's and all of the Guarantors' cash, accounts receivable and related assets, inventory (together with the grant of a license to use the Company's or such subsidiaries' intellectual property relating to such inventory) and proceeds of any of the foregoing.
 
The Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Credit Agreement are discussed below.
 
Indenture
Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company issued and sold to the Initial Purchasers $810 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The terms of the Indenture provide that, among other things, the Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's unsecured unsubordinated debt, senior to any of the Company's subordinated debt and effectively be subordinated to the Company's secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt, including all borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
 
Guarantees.
The Guarantors will guarantee the Company's obligations under the Notes on a senior unsecured basis.
 
Interest Rate
. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 10.50% per annum. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2009.
 
Optional Redemption.
The Company may redeem all or part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) a make-whole premium as of the date of redemption, plus (iii) accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, thereon, to the date of redemption.
 
Repurchase upon Change of Control.
Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes in cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase.
 
 
Other Covenants.
The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the Company's ability (as well as those of the Company's subsidiaries) to: incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; make certain investments and restricted payments; create liens;
create restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries; engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter new lines of business; engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions; and engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions.
 
Events of Default.
The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness, failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, including additional interest, on all the Notes to be due and payable.
 
The foregoing description of the Indenture and the Notes is summary in nature and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the Notes, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
Registration Rights Agreement
 
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed with the Initial Purchasers, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, to file a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange the Notes for an issue of registered notes of the Company (the "Exchange Notes") with terms identical to the Notes (except that the Exchange Notes will not be subject to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate as described below).
Promptly after the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") declares the exchange offer registration statement effective, the Company will offer the Exchange Notes in return for surrender of the Notes. The exchange offer will remain open for at least 20 business days after the date notice of the exchange offer is sent to holders. For each Note surrendered to the Company under the exchange offer, the holder will receive an Exchange Note of equal principal amount. Interest on each Exchange Note will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Notes or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes, from the issue date of the Notes (the "Issue Date").
If applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC do not permit the Company to effect the exchange offer, or under certain other circumstances, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Notes and to keep that shelf registration statement effective until the earlier of (i) two years after the Issue Date and (ii) such time as all the Notes have been sold under the shelf registration statement. The Company will, in the event that a shelf registration is filed, provide to each holder copies of a prospectus, notify each holder when the shelf registration statement has become effective and take certain other actions as are required to permit resales of the Notes. A holder that sells its Notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement generally will be required to be named as a selling securityholder in the related prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, will be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with those sales and will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights agreement that are applicable to a selling holder (including certain indemnification obligations).
If the Company has not exchanged the Exchange Notes for all Notes validly tendered in accordance with the terms of an exchange offer on or before September 30, 2009 or, if applicable, a shelf
 
registration statement covering resales of the Notes has not been declared effective or such shelf registration statement ceases to be effective at any time during the shelf registration period (subject to certain exceptions), then additional interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Notes at a rate of 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, up to a maximum additional rate of 1.0% per annum thereafter, until the exchange offer is completed or the shelf registration statement is declared effective. Any amounts of additional interest due will be payable in cash on the same interest payment dates as interest on the Notes is otherwise payable.
The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement is summary in nature and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3 and incorporated herein by reference.
Credit Agreement
The Credit Agreement consists of a senior secured three-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.
The material terms of the Credit Agreement include the following:
Maturity
. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate, on March 9, 2012. However, if the Company's 8.25% notes due 2011 are not refinanced, purchased or defeased prior to July 3, 2011, the loans made under the Credit Agreement will mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate, on July 3, 2011.
Interest Rate and Fees
. Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an annual rate of interest equal to (i) the base rate plus the applicable spread, as described below, or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus the applicable spread, as described below. The Company will pay a commission on letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement at a rate equal to the applicable spread for loans based upon the Eurocurrency rate under the Credit Agreement. The applicable spread will be the percentage described in the following chart that corresponds to the Company's corporate credit rating from Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc., as applicable.
 
The applicable spread will be at Level 1 at any time the Company's corporate rating from S&P is BB+ or above and the Company's corporate rating from Moody's is Ba1 or above. The applicable spread will be at Level 3 at any time the Company's corporate rating from S&P is not BB- or above or the Company's corporate rating from Moody's is not Ba3 or above or at any time the Company does not have a corporate rating from one or both of the rating agencies. The applicable spread will be at Level 2 at any
 
time the applicable spread is at neither Level 1 nor Level 3.
The Company will pay certain fees with respect to the Credit Agreement, including (i) a commitment fee of 1.00% per annum on the undrawn portion of the facility (subject to stepdowns based on the percent of the commitments utilized under the facility), (ii) fronting fees set forth in a fronting fee agreement between any issuing lender and the Company and (iii) customary annual administration fees.
Mandatory Prepayments
. If at any time the Company's outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement (including outstanding letters of credit and swingline loans) exceed the lesser of (i) the borrowing base as in effect at such time and (ii) the aggregate revolving commitments as in effect at such time, the Company will be required to prepay an amount equal to such excess.
Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, at any time that the Company is subject to cash dominion, as described below, the Company will be required to prepay outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds from dispositions of assets, issuance of debt and insurance proceeds or condemnation awards. Such mandatory prepayments will not permanently reduce the available commitments under the Credit Agreement.
Voluntary Prepayments
. Subject to certain conditions and restrictions, the Credit Agreement will allow us to voluntarily reduce the amount of the revolving commitments and to prepay the loans.
Covenants
. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the Company's ability (as well as those of the Company's subsidiaries) to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; pay dividends or make other payments in respect of the Company's capital stock; amend material documents; change the nature of the Company's business; make certain payments of debt; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale/leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.
In addition, the Company will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio when availability under the Credit Agreement is less than the greater of 15% of the commitments under the Credit Agreement and $150 million.
Guarantees and Collateral
. The Company's indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under the Credit Agreement will be unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis by the Company, the Guarantors and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company.
The Company's indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under the Credit Agreement and the related guarantees will be secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain of the Company's and all of the Guarantors' cash, accounts receivable and related assets, inventory (together with the grant of a license to use the Company's or such subsidiaries' intellectual property relating to such inventory), and proceeds of any of the foregoing and lockbox and deposit accounts into which any such proceeds are paid or transferred and any cash is deposited.
Cash Dominion
. If availability under the Credit Agreement is less than the greater of 20% of the revolving commitments and $180 million, amounts in any deposit account will be transferred daily into a blocked account held by the Administrative Agent and applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement.
Events of Default
. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default such as non-
 
payment of obligations under the Credit Agreement, violation of affirmative and negative covenants, material inaccuracy of representations, defaults under other material debt, bankruptcy, ERISA and judgment defaults, invalidity of the credit documents (or the Company's assertion of any such invalidity), change of control and loss of lien perfection or priority.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is summary in nature and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and incorporated herein by reference.

(B)      if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged any Indebtedness since the
 
 
 
beginning of such period or if any Indebtedness is to be repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged (in each case, other than Indebtedness Incurred under any revolving credit facility unless such Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) on the date of the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated on a
pro
forma

The Securities
SECTION 2.01.
Form and Dating.
Provisions relating to the Initial Securities and the Exchange Securities are set forth in the Rule 144A/Regulation S/IAI Appendix attached hereto (the "Appendix") which is hereby incorporated in, and expressly made part of, this Indenture. The Initial Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to the Appendix which is hereby incorporated in, and expressly made a part of, this Indenture. The Exchange Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to which the Company is subject, if any, or usage (
provided
that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company). Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The terms of the Securities set forth in the Appendix and Exhibit A are part of the terms of this Indenture.
SECTION 2.02.
Execution and Authentication.
Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature.
If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
SECTION 2.03.
Registrar and Paying Agent.
The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.
The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and
 
 
 
shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary incorporated or organized within the United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent.
The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities.
SECTION 2.04.
Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust.
Prior to each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
SECTION 2.05.
Securityholder Lists.
The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders.
SECTION 2.06.
Transfer and Exchange.
The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met.
SECTION 2.07.
Replacement Securities.
If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
 
 
 
Every replacement Security is an additional Obligation of the Company.
SECTION 2.08.
Outstanding Securities.
Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a protected purchaser (as defined in Section 8-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code).
If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
SECTION 2.09.
Temporary Securities.

To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or 4.03(b) as of the Reversion Date, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under Section 4.03(b)(4). Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Section 4.04 will be made as though Section 4.04

(5)       the Company fails to comply with Section 4.02 or any of its other agreements contained in this Indenture (other than those referred to in clause (1), (2), (3) or (4) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice specified below;
(6)       Indebtedness of the Company

(10)     any Subsidiary Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or the Subsidiary Guarantees of any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Subsidiary Guarantee) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee other than by reason of the termination of this Indenture or the release of any such Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with this Indenture.
The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

United States Code
, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
A Default under clause (4) or (5) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default".
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any Event of Default under clause (6) or (9) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (4), (5) or (8), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
SECTION 6.02.
Acceleration.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall
ipso
facto
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
 
 
 
SECTION 6.03.
Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
SECTION 6.04.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences, except (a) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security, (b) a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Security when required pursuant to this Indenture or (c) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
SECTION 6.05.
Control by Majority.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability;
provided
,
however
, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
SECTION 6.06.
Limitation on Suits.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Securityholder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless:
(1)       the Holder gives the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2)       the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3)       such Holder or Holders offer the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(4)       the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
 
 
 
(5)       the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.
A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Securityholder. In the event that the Definitive Securities are not issued to any beneficial owner promptly after the Registrar has received a request from the Holder of a Global Security to issue such Definitive Securities to such beneficial owner or its nominee, the Company expressly agrees and acknowledges, with respect to the right of any Holder to pursue a remedy pursuant to this Indenture, the right of such beneficial holder of Securities to pursue such remedy with respect to the portion of the Global Security that represents such beneficial holder's Securities is as if such Definitive Securities had been issued.
SECTION 6.07.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 6.08.
Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07.
SECTION 6.09.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, the costs and expenses at collection and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.
Priorities.
If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order:
FIRST:            to the Trustee for amounts due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, the costs and expenses at collection and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07;
SECOND:       to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
 
 
 
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to each Securityholder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid.
SECTION 6.10.
Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
SECTION 6.11.
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
The Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance
SECTION 8.01.
Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance.
(a)  When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Securities have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof, or will become due and payable within one year, and, in the case of this clause (2), the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Securities, including interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07), and if, in either case, the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(c), cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company.
(b)       Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its obligations under the Securities and this Indenture ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations under Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12 and the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) and the limitations contained in Section 5.01(a)(3) ("covenant defeasance option").
 
 
 
The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(5) (solely with respect to SEC reports), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, shall be released from all its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee.
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.

SECTION 8.02.
Conditions to Defeasance.

(3)       123 days pass after the deposit is made and during such 123-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs that is continuing at the end of the period;

(7)       in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; and

SECTION 9.04.
Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers.
A consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective.

Notation on or Exchange of Securities.

Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.
SECTION 9.06.
Trustee To Sign Amendments.

rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it.

ARTICLE 10
 
Subsidiary Guarantees
SECTION 10.01. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Securities when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article 10 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation.
Guarantees.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (1) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person (including any Subsidiary Guarantor)under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise; (2) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (3) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement; (4) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (5) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (6) except as set forth in Section 10.06, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee
 
 
 
of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Except as expressly set forth in Sections 8.01(b), 10.02 and 10.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (A) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (B) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (C) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section.
 
 
 
SECTION 10.02. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby Guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Limitation on Liability.
SECTION 10.03. This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
Successors and Assigns.
SECTION 10.04. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver.
SECTION 10.05. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Modification.

TERMS USED ABOVE HAVE THE MEANINGS
 
 
 
GIVEN TO THEM IN REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.
Each Definitive Security shall also bear the following additional legend:
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER, THE HOLDER WILL DELIVER TO THE REGISTRAR AND TRANSFER AGENT SUCH CERTIFICATES AND OTHER INFORMATION AS SUCH TRANSFER AGENT MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT THE TRANSFER COMPLIES WITH THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS.
(ii)       Upon any sale or transfer of a Transfer Restricted Security (including any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a Global Security) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Registrar shall permit the transferee thereof to exchange such Transfer Restricted Security for a certificated Security that does not bear the legend set forth above and rescind any restriction on the transfer of such Transfer Restricted Security, if the transferor thereof certifies in writing to the Registrar that such sale or transfer was made in reliance on Rule 144 (such certification to be in the form set forth on the reverse of the Security).
(iii)      After a transfer of any Initial Securities pursuant to and during the period of the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such Initial Securities, all requirements pertaining to legends on such Initial Security will cease to apply, the requirements requiring any such Initial Security issued to certain Holders be issued in global form will cease to apply, and a certificated Initial Security or an Initial Security in global form, in each case without restrictive transfer legends, will be available to the transferee of the Holder of such Initial Securities upon exchange of such transferring Holder's certificated Initial Security or directions to transfer such Holder's interest in the Global Security, as applicable.
(iv)      Upon the consummation of a Registered Exchange Offer with respect to the Initial Securities, all requirements pertaining to such Initial Securities that Initial Securities issued to certain Holders be issued in global form will still apply with respect to Holders of such Initial Securities that do not exchange their Initial Securities, and Exchange Securities in certificated or global form, in each case without the restricted securities legend set forth in Exhibit 1 hereto will be available to Holders that exchange such Initial Securities in such Registered Exchange Offer.
(f)

At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Security is exchanged for Definitive Securities, redeemed,
 
 
 
purchased or canceled, the principal amount of Securities represented by such Global Security shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Trustee (if it is then the Securities Custodian for such Global Security) with respect to such Global Security, by the Trustee or the Securities Custodian, to reflect such reduction.
(i)        The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner of a Global Security, a member of, or a participant in the Depository or other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depository or its nominee or of any participant or member thereof, with respect to any ownership interest in the Securities or with respect to the delivery to any participant, member, beneficial owner or other Person (other than the Depository) of any notice (including any notice of redemption) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect to such Securities. All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to Holders under the Securities shall be given or made only to or upon the order of the registered Holders (which shall be the Depository or its nominee in the case of a Global Security). The rights of beneficial owners in any Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depository subject to the applicable rules and procedures of the Depository. The Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository with respect to its members, participants and any beneficial owners.

Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate certain of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.

The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest) if it determines in good faith that withholding notice is not opposed to the interests of the Holders.
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.

(ii)       In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required pursuant to Section 2(b)(i)(A) or 2(b)(i)(B) hereof, has not become effective on or prior to the Target Registration Date, the interest rate on the Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the Target Registration Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case, until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, becomes effective or the obligation to conduct the Exchange Offer and/or file the Shelf Registration Statement terminates pursuant to Section 2(g) hereof, at which time, in each case, the interest rate on the Securities shall revert to the original interest rate on the Issue Date;
provided
that in no event will such additional interest exceed 1.00% per annum. In the event that the Company receives a Shelf Request pursuant to Section 2(b)(i)(C) hereof, and the Shelf Registration Statement required to be filed thereby has not become effective by 90 days after the delivery of such Shelf Request (such later date, the Shelf Additional Interest Date), then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period commencing from one day after the Shelf Additional Interest Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case, until the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the obligation to file the Shelf Registration Statement terminates pursuant to Section 2(g) hereof, at which time, in each case, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities shall revert to the original interest rate on the Issue Date;
provided
that in no event will such additional interest exceed 1.00% per annum.
(iii)      If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 30 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Securities will be increased by 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period commencing on the 31 day in such 12-month period, and will increase by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 1.00 per annum, and ending on the date that the Shelf Registration Statement again becomes effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable, at which time, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities shall revert to the original interest rate on the Issue Date.
st
(e)       Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that any failure by the Company or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries
 
 
 
 
 
precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Companys and the Guarantors obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.
(f)        The Company represents, warrants and covenants that it (including its agents and representatives) will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Free Writing Prospectus without the prior written consent of JPMorgan.
(g)       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the Company and the Guarantors to effect the Exchange Offer and/or file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Issue Date if such Exchange Offer and/or filing of a Shelf Registration Statement has not occurred prior to such time.

(xiii)    in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by a representative of the Holders of the Registrable Securities (an Inspector), any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, any attorneys and accountants designated by a majority of the Holders of Registrable Securities to be included in such Shelf Registration and any attorneys and accountants designated by such Underwriter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all pertinent financial and other records, documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, and cause the respective officers, directors and employees of the Company and the Guarantors to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement;
provided

The Company may exclude from such Shelf Registration Statement the Registrable Securities of any Holder who fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time (not to exceed fifteen Business Days) after receiving such request and shall be under no obligation to compensate any
 
 
 
 
 
such Holder for any lost income, interest or other opportunity forgone, or any liability incurred, as a result of the Companys decision to exclude such Holder in accordance with this paragraph.
(c)       In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(v)(C) or 3(a)(v)(E) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(ix) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and the Guarantors, such Holder will deliver to the Company and the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holders possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.
(d)       If the Company and the Guarantors shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company and the Guarantors may give any such notice only twice, and there shall not be more than two suspensions in effect, during any 365-day period and any such suspensions shall not exceed 30 days for each suspension.

No Holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell such Holders Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Majority Holders and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
4.         
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
. (a)  The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a Participating Broker-Dealer) may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
The Company and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staffs position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may
 
 
 
 
 
be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b)       In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof), in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) such Prospectus during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
(c)       The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
5.         
Indemnification and Contribution
. (a)  The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder and each of their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus used in violation of this Agreement or any issuer information (Issuer Information) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through JPMorgan, BA or Barclays or any selling Holder, respectively, expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3 hereof, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution and their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
 
 
 
 
 
(b)       Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 5(a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement and any Prospectus.
(c)       If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either Section 5(a) or Section 5(b) above, such Person (the Indemnified Person) shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the Indemnifying Person) in writing;
provided
that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5, except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and
provided
,
further
, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding, including the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (A) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by JPMorgan, (B) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (C) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person
 
 
 
 
 
agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (1) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (2) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d)       If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)       The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by
pro
rata
allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 5(d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 5(d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or the Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
 
 
 
 
 
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
(f)        The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g)       The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
(a)       
No Inconsistent Agreements.
The Company and the Guarantors represent, warrant and agree that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor under any other agreement and (ii) neither the Company nor any Guarantor has entered into, or on or after the date of this Agreement will enter into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
(b)       
Amendments and Waivers.
The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company and the Guarantors have obtained the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Registrable Securities affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent;

36

Any Swingline Loan and any Protective Advance shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 2.04 and 2.05, respectively. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.
(b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Loan and Protective Advance shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan,
provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.

SECTION 2.03.
Requests for Revolving Borrowings.
To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile or other electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request substantially in the form of
Exhibit E

(i) the name of the applicable Borrower;

(vii) that as of such date the conditions set forth in Sections 4.02(a), (b) and (c) are satisfied.
If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
SECTION 2.04.
Swingline Loans.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrowers, from time to time during the Availability Period if, after giving effect thereto, (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans shall not exceed $50,000,000 and (ii) the total Credit Exposures shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the Total Commitment and (y) the Borrowing Base,
provided
that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.
(b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Company (on behalf of itself or, if applicable, the relevant Borrower) or the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of such proposed Swingline Loan. Each such telephonic request shall be confirmed promptly by facsimile or other electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the name of the relevant Borrower, the requested date of the Swingline Loan (which shall be a Business Day), the amount
 
38
 
 
of the requested Swingline Loan and the location and number of such Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Company or the relevant Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the relevant Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of such Borrower maintained with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f), by remittance to the relevant Issuing Lender).
(c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the relevant Borrower (or other party on behalf of the relevant Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear,
provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to any Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrowers of any default in the payment thereof.
(d) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Swingline Lender, shall request settlement (a "
Settlement
") with the Lenders on at least a weekly basis or on any earlier date that the Administrative Agent elects, by notifying the Lenders of such requested Settlement by facsimile, telephone, or e-mail no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time on the date of such requested Settlement (the "
Settlement Date
"). Each Lender (other than the Swingline Lender, in the case of the Swingline Loans) shall transfer the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the applicable Loan with respect to which Settlement is requested to the Administrative Agent, to such account of the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may designate, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Settlement Date. Settlements may occur during the existence of a Default and whether or not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have then been satisfied. Such amounts transferred to the Administrative Agent shall be applied against the amounts of the Swingline Lender's Swingline Loans and, together with Swingline
 
39
 
 
Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders, respectively. If any such amount is not transferred to the Administrative Agent by any Lender on such Settlement Date, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon as specified in Section 2.07.
SECTION 2.05.
Protective Advances.
(a) Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding (but subject to the limitations set forth below in this Section), the Administrative Agent is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, in its sole discretion (but with absolutely no obligation), and whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied, to make Loans to the Borrowers, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, in amounts that exceed Availability, which the Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (i) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (ii) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to or required to be paid by the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including payments of reimbursable expenses (including costs, fees, and expenses as described in Section 9.03) and other sums payable under the Loan Documents (any such Loans are herein referred to collectively as "
Protective Advances
"), it being agreed that no Protective Advance shall result in a Default due to the Borrowers' failure to comply with Section 2.01 or Section 4.02 for so long as such Protective Advance remains outstanding in accordance with the terms of this Section, but solely with respect to the amount of such Protective Advance. Protective Advances shall be secured by the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Obligations hereunder. All Protective Advances shall be ABR Borrowings. The authority of the Administrative Agent to make Protective Advances is limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of the Total Commitment at any time, and no Protective Advance shall cause any Lender's Credit Exposure to exceed its Commitment,
provided
that the Required Lenders may at any time revoke the Administrative Agent's authorization to make Protective Advances (it being agreed that any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the Administrative Agent's receipt thereof). At any time that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied, the Administrative Agent may request the Revolving Lenders to make a Revolving Loan to repay a Protective Advance. At any other time the Administrative Agent may require the Lenders to fund their risk participations described in Section 2.05(b).
(b) Upon the making of a Protective Advance by the Administrative Agent, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Administrative Agent without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such Protective Advance equal to its Applicable Percentage of such Protective Advance. The Administrative Agent may, at any time, require the Revolving Lenders to fund their participations in any Protective Advance. From and after the date, if any, on which any Revolving Lender is required to fund its participation in any Protective Advance purchased hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender such Lender's Applicable Percentage of all payments of principal and interest (to the extent accrued on or after such date) and all proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent in respect of such Protective Advance.
SECTION 2.06.
Letters of Credit.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for herein, from time to time during the Availability Period, a Borrower may request any Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit denominated in dollars for the account of such Borrower. Each Letter of Credit shall be in such form as shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Lender in its reasonable determination.  Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments.
 
40
 
 
(b) (i) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), a Borrower shall deliver by hand or facsimile (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the relevant Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit) to such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, that such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in dollars, the name of the account party (which shall be a Borrower or a Subsidiary and a Borrower as co-applicants), the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  It is understood that the reinstatement of all or a portion of a Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms thereof following a drawing thereunder shall not constitute an amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit. If requested by such Issuing Lender, such Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Lender's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by a Borrower to, or entered into by a Borrower with, any Issuing Lender relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(ii) On the Effective Date, each Issuing Lender that has issued an Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have granted to each Revolving Lender and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased from such Issuing Lender a participation in such Existing Letter of Credit in accordance with paragraph (e) below. The applicable Issuing Lenders and the Lenders that were also party to the Existing Credit Agreement agree that concurrently with such grant, the participations in the Existing Letters of Credit granted to such lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be automatically canceled without further action by any of the parties thereto. On and after the Effective Date, each Existing Letter of Credit shall constitute a Letter of Credit for all purposes hereof.
(c) A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure would not exceed the greater of (A) $500,000,000 and (B) 50% of the Total Commitment and (ii) the sum of the total Credit Exposures would not exceed the lesser of (x) the Borrowing Base and (y) the Total Commitment.
(d) No Letter of Credit shall have a stated expiry date that is later than the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit, so long as such renewal or extension occurs within three months of such then-current expiration date) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Commitment Termination Date;
provided
that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above) under customary "evergreen" provisions.
(e) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by any Issuing Lender, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit or the Lenders, such Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter
 
41
 
 
of Credit.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each relevant Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of a notice as provided for in the final paragraph of Section 2.06(f), to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender of each Letter of Credit such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Lender promptly upon the request of such Issuing Lender at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the relevant Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason.  Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the relevant Borrower pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Lender as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the relevant Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f) If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the relevant Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time (or, in the case of an LC Disbursement that is being funded with an ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan, 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on (i) the Business Day that the relevant Borrower receives notice that such LC Disbursement has been made, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the relevant Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time;
provided
that the relevant Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or Section 2.04 that such payment be financed with all or any portion of an ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan, as applicable, in an amount permitted under Section 2.02(c) and, to the extent so financed, the relevant Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan (or the applicable portion thereof). Each such payment shall be made to the relevant Issuing Lender in dollars and in immediately available funds.
If any Borrower fails to make payment when due in respect of any LC Disbursement relating to a Letter of Credit issued for its account, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.
(g) Each Borrower's obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.06(f) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged or fraudulent or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Lender under
 
42
 
 
a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders as security for any of such reimbursement obligations shall fail to be perfected, (v) the occurrence of any Default, (vi) the existence of any proceedings of the type described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII with respect to any other Loan Party, (vii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of such reimbursement obligations against any other Loan Party, or (viii) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of any Borrower hereunder.
Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Lenders, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by any Issuing Lender thereof or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Lender from liability to any Borrower or to any Lender which has funded its participation hereunder in such Letter of Credit to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Loan Parties and the Lenders to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Borrower or any such Lender, as the case may be, that are caused by such Issuing Lender's failure to exercise the standard of care agreed hereunder to be applicable when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that such standard of care shall be as follows, and that such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised such standard of care in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment):
(i) an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
(ii) an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(h) Upon presentation of documents with respect to a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit, each Issuing Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit shall (i) promptly notify the Administrative Agent, the Company and (if different) the relevant Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such demand for payment, (ii) promptly following its receipt of such documents, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit and (iii) promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent, the Company and (if different) the relevant Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) whether the Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement under such Letter of Credit;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving any such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f).
 
43
 
 
(i) If any Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the relevant Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to, but excluding, the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans;
provided
that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.06(f), then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.06(d) to reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(j) An Issuing Lender may be added, or an existing Issuing Lender may be terminated, under this Agreement at any time by written agreement between the Company, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such addition or termination.  At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the Issuing Lender being terminated.  From and after the effective date of any such addition, the new Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter.  References herein to the term "Issuing Lender" shall be deemed to refer to each new Issuing Lender or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such new Issuing Lender and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the termination of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the terminated Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not be required to issue any new Letters of Credit or to renew or extend any such outstanding Letters of Credit.
(k) If either (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph or (ii) any of the other provisions of this Agreement require cash collateralization, the Company shall deposit within one Business Day after notice from the Administrative Agent of the requirement thereof into an account established and maintained on the books and records of the Administrative Agent, which account may be a "securities account" (within the meaning of Section 8-501 of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York), in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Secured Parties (the "
LC Collateral Account
"), an amount in immediately available funds in Dollars equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of such date
plus
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such amount shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposits shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the LC Exposure under this Agreement and for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations, and for this purpose the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the LC Collateral Account, the LC Collateral Account shall be subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement and each Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in the LC Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the UCC) or other property held therein. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent (in accordance with its usual and customary practices for investments of this type) and at the Borrowers' risk and reasonable expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the LC Collateral Account. Moneys and financial assets in the LC Collateral Account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and,
 
44
 
 
to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall cause all such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) to be returned to the Company within three Business Days after (A) in the case of clause (i) above, the applicable Event of Default shall have been cured or waived (so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time) or (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, such cash collateral shall no longer be required pursuant to the applicable provision hereof.
(l) Each of the letters of credit outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement and listed on
Schedule 2.01
shall automatically, and without any action on the part of any Person, be deemed a Letter of Credit issued and continued hereunder as of the Effective Date.
(m) Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender shall (i) provide to the Administrative Agent copies of any notice received from any Borrower pursuant to Section 2.06(b) no later than the Business Day after receipt thereof and (ii) report in writing to the Administrative Agent (A) on the first Business Day of each week, the activity for each day during the immediately preceding week in respect of Letters of Credit issued by it, including all issuances, extensions, amendments and renewals, all expirations and cancellations and all disbursements and reimbursements, (B) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, whether such Letter of Credit is a trade, financial or performance Letter of Credit, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amount thereof changed), and no Issuing Lender shall be permitted to issue, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension is then permitted by the terms of this Agreement, (C) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender makes any LC Disbursement, the date of such LC Disbursement and the amount and currency of such LC Disbursement and (D) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request, including but not limited to prompt verification of such information as may be requested by the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 2.07.
Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, or, in the case of an ABR Loan, 2:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders,
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly, and in no event later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Company in the applicable Borrowing Request,
provided
that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of a Protective Advance shall be retained by the Administrative Agent or, to the extent that the Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.05 to reimburse the Administrative Agent in respect of any such Protective Advance, respectively, remitted by the Administrative Agent to such Revolving Lenders as their interests may appear.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance
 
45
 
 
upon such assumption and in its sole discretion, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrowers agree (jointly and severally with each other Borrower, but severally and not jointly with the applicable Lenders) to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Loan. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount (less interest) shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. With respect to any share of a Borrowing not made available by a Lender as contemplated above, if such Lender subsequently pays its share of such Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly repay any corresponding amount paid by the relevant Borrower to the Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph (including interest thereon to the extent received by the Administrative Agent);
provided
that such repayment to such Borrower shall not operate as a waiver or any abandonment of any rights or remedies of such Borrower with respect to such Lender.
SECTION 2.08.
Interest Elections.
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or designated by Section 2.03 and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request or designated by Section 2.03. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings or Protective Advances, which may not be converted or continued.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company was requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile or by other electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request substantially in the form of
Exhibit F
signed by the Company (on behalf of itself or the applicable Borrower) or the applicable Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.03:
(i) the name of the applicable Borrower and the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
46
 
 
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period" and permitted under Section 2.02(d).
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Company or the Subsidiary Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Revolving Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.09.
Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, all Commitments shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.
(b) The Company, on behalf of the Borrowers, may at any time terminate, without premium or penalty (other than, with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, payments that may become due under Section 2.16), the Commitments upon (i) the payment in full of all outstanding Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, (ii) the payment in full of the accrued and unpaid fees and (iii) the payment in full of all reimbursable expenses and other Obligations together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company, on behalf of the Borrowers, may from time to time reduce, without premium or penalty (other than, with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, payments that may become due under Section 2.16), the Commitments,
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the aggregate Credit Exposures would exceed the Total Commitment. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under this paragraph at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this paragraph shall be irrevocable,
provided
that a notice of termination or reduction of Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of other Indebtedness or any other event, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
 
47
 
 
SECTION 2.10.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) The Borrowers hereby unconditionally promise to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Commitment Termination Date, (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Commitment Termination Date and the date that is the seventh day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) after such Swingline Loan is made, and (iii) to the Administrative Agent the then unpaid principal amount of each Protective Advance on the earliest of (A) the Commitment Termination Date, (B) the day that is 30 days after the making of such Protective Advance (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) and (C) demand by the Administrative Agent,
provided
that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made by the Company or any Subsidiary Borrower, the Company or such Subsidiary Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the date such Borrowing was requested.
(b) On each Business Day during any Cash Dominion Period, except to the extent that during a continuing Event of Default the Administrative Agent elects, or the Required Lenders direct, amounts to be applied as set forth in Section 2.18(c), the Administrative Agent shall apply all immediately available funds credited to the Collection Account (other than any amounts required under the Security Agreement to be applied to or held as collateral for the TFM Indenture Obligations) and the Administrative Agent may, in its Permitted Discretion, apply other amounts contained in deposit accounts and securities accounts subject to Deposit Account Control Agreements and Securities Account Control Agreements, in each case,
first
to prepay any Protective Advances that may be outstanding, pro rata,
second
to prepay any Swingline Loans that may be outstanding,
third
to prepay any Revolving Loans that may be outstanding, it being understood that any prepayments of Revolving Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.18(c) and
fourth
to cash collateralize outstanding LC Exposure in the manner provided in Section 2.06(k). If the Borrowers are required to provide (and have provided the required amount of) cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.10(b), the amount of such cash collateral (to the extent not otherwise required to be maintained by any other provision of this Agreement) shall be returned to the Borrowers within two Business Days after the last day of such Cash Dominion Period.
(c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof, (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of any Issuing Lender and (v) the application or disbursement by the Administrative Agent of any amounts pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(e) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein,
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans and pay interest thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(f) Any Lender may request that Revolving Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such
 
48
 
 
Lender a promissory note, substantially in the form of
Exhibit I
, payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
SECTION 2.11.
Prepayment of Loans.
(a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay without premium or penalty (other than, with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, payments that may become due under Section 2.16) any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.
(b) Except for Protective Advances permitted under Section 2.05, in the event and on each occasion that the aggregate Credit Exposures of the Lenders exceed the lesser of (i) the Total Commitment and (ii) the Borrowing Base, the Borrowers shall prepay Revolving Borrowings and/or Swingline Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;
provided
that if the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Borrowings and Swingline Borrowings then outstanding is less than the amount of such excess (because LC Exposure constitutes a portion thereof), the Borrowers shall deposit an amount in cash equal to such excess in the LC Collateral Account. If the Borrowers are required to provide (and have provided the required amount of) cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) and such excess is subsequently reduced, cash collateral in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) any such reduction and (y) the amount of such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in Section 2.06(k)) shall be returned to the Borrowers within two Business Days after such reduction.
(c) Prior to any optional prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the applicable Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and the Company shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section.
(d) In the event and on each occasion that, during any Cash Dominion Period, any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of any Loan Party in respect of any Prepayment Event, the Borrowers shall, immediately after such Net Proceeds are received, prepay Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans (without a corresponding reduction in the Total Commitment) and, after all such Loans have been repaid, cash collateralize outstanding LC Exposure, in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds, in each case to the extent such Net Proceeds have not been deposited into the Collection Account for application by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Security Agreement. If the Borrowers are required to provide (and have provided the required amount of) cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.11(d), the amount of such cash collateral (to the extent not otherwise required to be maintained by any other provision of this Agreement) shall be returned to the Borrowers within two Business Days after the last day of such Cash Dominion Period.
(e) The Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by facsimile or by other electronic transmission) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, set forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment,
provided
that a notice of optional prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other
 
49
 
 
credit facilities or the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of other Indebtedness or any other event, in which case such notice of prepayment may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans) the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Revolving Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11.
SECTION 2.12.
Fees.
(a) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the daily unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the Commitment Termination Date. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year and on the Commitment Termination Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender and its Applicable Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Protective Advances shall be disregarded for such purpose).
(b) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the Commitment Termination Date and the date on which such Lender ceases to have LC Exposure.
(c) The relevant Borrower with respect to each Letter of Credit agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit (i) a fronting fee, which shall accrue at a rate per annum separately agreed by the Company and such Issuing Lender, on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to such Letter of Credit (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to but excluding the date on which there ceases to be any such LC Exposure under such Letter of Credit and (ii) such Issuing Lender's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.
(d) Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of each calendar month shall be payable on the third Business Day of each calendar month following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the Commitment Termination Date and any such fees accruing after the Commitment Termination Date shall be payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to any Issuing Lender pursuant to paragraph (c) above shall be payable at the times separately agreed upon between the Company or the relevant Borrower and such Issuing Lender or otherwise within 10 days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
 
50
 
 
(e) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon in writing between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
(f) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of commitment fees, in accordance with this Section 2.12. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
SECTION 2.13.
Interest.
(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(c) Each Protective Advance shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate for Revolving Loans.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by a Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% per annum
plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% per annum
plus
the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments,
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the Commitment Termination Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.14.
Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing:
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
 
51
 
 
Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their respective Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone (promptly confirmed in writing) or facsimile or by other electronic transmission as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Revolving Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be converted to, or continued as, an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing,
provided
that following the first day that such condition shall cease to exist, such Borrowings may be made as or converted to Eurocurrency Borrowings at the request of and in accordance with the elections of the applicable Borrower.
SECTION 2.15.
Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate) or any Issuing Lender;
(ii) subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any (or any increase in any) Other Connection Taxes with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Letter of Credit, or any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made or Letter of Credit issued by it
, except any such Taxes imposed on or measured by its net income or profits (however denominated) or franchise Taxes imposed in lieu of net income or profits Taxes;
or
(iii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost, or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan, or in the case of clause (ii), any Loan, (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered to the extent resulting from any of the foregoing.
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing
 
52
 
 
Lender or such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered due to such Change in Law.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Lender setting forth in reasonable detail calculations of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or their respective holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation,
provided
that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
SECTION 2.16.
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan (or to convert any ABR Loan into a Eurocurrency Loan) on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company to replace a Lender pursuant to Section 2.19(b) or Section 9.02(c), then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and reasonable expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurocurrency Rate (without consideration of the Applicable Rate) that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market (without consideration of the Applicable Rate). A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after the Company's receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17.
Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes, provided that if any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent (as defined below)) requires the deduction or withholding of any Indemnified Tax from any such payment (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such deduction or withholding required to be made by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, or, in the case of any Lender that is treated as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, by such Lender for the
 
53
 
 
account of any of its direct or indirect beneficial owners), the applicable Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, the Lender or the applicable direct or indirect beneficial owner of a Lender (any such person a "Withholding Agent") shall make such deductions and timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions for Indemnified Taxes (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender, any Issuing Lender or its beneficial owner, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.
(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.17(a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) To the extent not paid, reimbursed or compensated pursuant to Section 2.17(a) or (b), the Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender and Issuing Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lender (or its beneficial owner) or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties under any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable by the Administrative Agent, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the Loan Parties to a Governmental Authority pursuant to Section 2.17(a), the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any applicable withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, in the case of any withholding tax other than the U.S. Federal withholding tax, the completion, execution and
 
54
 
 
submission of such forms shall not be required if in the Foreign Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Foreign Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Foreign Lender.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a U.S. Borrower, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the U.S. is a party,
(ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the Form of Exhibit L to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (D) the interest payments in question are not effectively connected with the United States trade or business conducted by such Lender (a "
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
") and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN,
(iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical participation), an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided
that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more beneficial owners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of such beneficial owners, or
(v) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered by such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Lender shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such Lender's legal inability to do so.
(g) Each Fee Receiver hereby represents that it is a Permitted Fee Receiver
and agrees to update Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or its successor form) or the applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or its successor form) upon any change in such Fee Receiver's circumstances or if such form expires or becomes inaccurate or obsolete, and to promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent if such Fee Receiver becomes legally ineligible to provide such form.
 
55
 
 
(h) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid by any Borrower pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Indemnified Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
, that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will any Issuing Lender or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Borrower the payment of which would place the Issuing Lender or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Issuing Lender or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This clause shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
(i) Each party's obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive termination of the Loan Documents and payment
of any obligations thereunder.
SECTION 2.18.
Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or fees or reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 9.03, or otherwise) at or prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under any other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York or at such other address that the Administrative Agent shall advise the Company in writing, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under any Loan Document shall be made in dollars. At all times during a Cash Dominion Period, solely for purposes of determining the amount of Loans available for borrowing purposes, checks (in addition to immediately available funds applied pursuant to Section 2.10(b)) from collections of items of payment and proceeds of any Collateral shall be applied in whole or in part against the Obligations on the Business Day after receipt, subject to actual collection.
(b) Prior to any repayment of any Borrowings hereunder (other than the repayment in full of all outstanding Borrowings on the scheduled date of such repayment), the Borrowers shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such selection at the times and on the days provided in Section 2.11(e);
 
56
 
 
provided
that each repayment of Borrowings shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings before any other Borrowings.  If a Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid (in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) or prepaid (in accordance with Section 2.11), such payment shall be applied, first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings and, second, to other Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first).  Each repayment or prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing.
(c) Any proceeds of Collateral or any other amounts received by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement or another Loan Document (i) not constituting either (A) a specific payment of principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrowers), (B) a mandatory prepayment under Section 2.11(which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.11), (C) amounts to be used to cash collateralize LC Exposures, (D) amounts to be applied from the Collection Account during any Cash Dominion Period (which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.10(b)) or (ii) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders so direct, shall (except to the extent required under the terms of the Security Agreement to be paid or held for payment to the TFM Noteholders or their trustee or other representative) be applied ratably to the Secured Obligations as follows:
first
, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender under any Loan Document (other than in connection with Additional Obligations),
second
, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Loan Parties (other than in connection with Additional Obligations),
third
, to pay interest due in respect of the Protective Advances,
fourth
, to pay the principal of the Protective Advances,
fifth
, to pay interest then due and payable on the Loans (other than the Protective Advances) or unreimbursed LC Disbursements ratably,
sixth
, to prepay principal on the Loans (other than the Protective Advances) and unreimbursed LC Disbursements ratably,
seventh
, to the payment of any other Secured Obligations (other than Additional Obligations) due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Loan Parties,
eighth
, to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, and
ninth
to the payment of any amounts owing with respect to Additional Obligations that constitute Secured Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Company, or unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall apply any payment that it receives to a Eurocurrency Loan, except (x) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurocurrency Loan or (y) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR Loans and, in any such event, the Borrowers shall pay the break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.16. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(d) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:  (i) subject to the last sentence of Section 2.03, each Revolving Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of commitment fees under Section 2.12(a) shall be made for the accounts of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the Commitments under Section 2.09 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) subject to the last sentence of Section 2.03, each Revolving Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Revolving Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Revolving Loans by a Borrower shall be made for the account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid
 
57
 
 
principal amounts of the Revolving Loans made to such Borrower and held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans by a Borrower shall be made for the accounts of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to them.
(e) At the election of the Administrative Agent, all payments of principal, interest, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses (including, without limitation, all reimbursement for fees and expenses pursuant to Section 9.03), and other sums payable under the Loan Documents that are not paid when due in accordance with the Loan Documents (after giving effect to any applicable grace period(s)), may be paid from the proceeds of Borrowings made hereunder whether made following a request by a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03 or a deemed request as provided in this Section or may be deducted from any deposit account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes, solely to the extent a payment is not paid by a Loan Party by the time when required to be paid, (i) the Administrative Agent to make a Borrowing in the name of such Borrower for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees payable by such Borrower as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans (including Swingline Loans and Protective Advances, but such a Borrowing may only constitute a Protective Advance if it is to reimburse costs, fees and expenses as described in Section 9.03) and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Sections 2.03, 2.04 or 2.05, as applicable, and (ii) the Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees payable by such Borrower as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents.
(f) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)
first
, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)
second
, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(g) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans,
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or any LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off
 
58
 
 
and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(h) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company or the relevant Borrower, prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender or an Issuing Lender hereunder, that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(i) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or (d), 2.05(a) or (b), 2.06(e) or (f), 2.07(b), 2.17(d), 2.18(h) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lenders (or, following the payment of all amounts then due to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lenders, to the extent the Lenders shall have funded payments to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Lender in respect of other such amounts, for the benefit of the other Lenders) to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Lenders), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued
 
59
 
 
fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling such Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20.
Commitment Increases.
(a) The Borrowers may from time to time (and more than one time), by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), request that the Total Commitment be increased by an amount not less than $50,000,000 (or, at any time during the 30 day period commencing on the Effective Date, $15,000,000) for any such increase, except to the extent necessary to utilize the remaining unused amount of increase permitted under this Section 2.20(a);
provided
that the aggregate amount of Commitment Increases effected pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed US$250,000,000 and that immediately after giving effect to the effectiveness of each such increase of the Total Commitment the General Debt Basket Usage shall be not more than $750,000,000 and the Secured Debt Basket Usage shall be not more than $500,000,000. Such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested increase in the Commitments and the date on which such increase is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than ten Business Days or more than 60 days after the date of such notice), and shall offer each Lender the opportunity to increase its Commitment by such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the proposed increased amount. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not more than ten days after the date of the Company's notice, either agree to increase its applicable Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount or decline to increase its applicable Commitment (and any Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period of ten days shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment). In the event that, on the tenth day after the Company shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, the Lenders shall have declined to increase their Commitments or have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to increase their Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the Total Commitment requested by the Company, the Company may arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other financial institution, together with any existing Lender that agrees to increase its applicable Commitment pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, being called an "
Augmenting Lender
") to provide Commitments or increase their existing Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount on the same terms (including upfront fees) as were offered to the Lenders (or on terms more advantageous to the Company),
provided
that each Augmenting Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and shall not be subject to the approval of any other Lenders, and the Company and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Commitment of such Augmenting Lender and/or its status as a Lender hereunder. Any increase in the Total Commitment may be made in an amount that is less than the increase requested by the Company if the Company is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for, Augmenting Lenders.
(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any increase in the Total Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.20 (the "
Commitment Increase
"), this Agreement may be amended (such amendment, a "
Commitment Increase Amendment
") without the consent of any Lenders to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Commitment Increase evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.02(b) (including, if applicable, any increase in the Applicable Rate or the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate). Upon each Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section, (i) each Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each Augmenting Lender providing a portion of such Commitment Increase, and each such Augmenting Lender will automatically and without further act
 
60
 
 
be deemed to have assumed, a portion of such Lender's participations hereunder in outstanding Swingline Loans and Protective Advances such that, after giving effect to such Commitment Increase and each such deemed assignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding participations hereunder in Swingline Loans and Protective Advances held by each Lender (including each such Augmenting Lender) will equal such Lender's Applicable Percentage and (ii) if, on the date of such Commitment Increase, there are any Revolving Loans outstanding, such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Commitment Increase be prepaid from the proceeds of additional Revolving Loans made hereunder (reflecting such Commitment Increase), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the Revolving Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Lender in accordance with Section 2.11. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing,
pro
rata
borrowing and
pro
rata
payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
(c) Increases and new Commitments created pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective on the date specified in the notice delivered by the Company pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph (a) above or on such other date as agreed upon by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Augmenting Lenders.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in any Commitment of any Lender) or addition of an Augmenting Lender shall become effective under this Section unless on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied as of such date (as though the effectiveness of such increase were a Borrowing) and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Company.
SECTION 2.21.
Additional Subsidiary Borrowers.
The Company may, at any time and from time to time, designate a Domestic Subsidiary that is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, with the prior written consent of each Lender, as a Subsidiary Borrower, in each case by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrower Joinder Agreement and a Guarantor Joinder Agreement executed by such Domestic Subsidiary and by the Company, and upon such delivery such Domestic Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement. Any Subsidiary Borrower shall continue to be a Subsidiary Borrower until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrower Termination Agreement with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower, whereupon such Subsidiary Borrower shall cease to be a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (a) no Borrower Joinder Agreement shall become effective as to any such Domestic Subsidiary if it shall be unlawful for such Domestic Subsidiary to become a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder or for any Lender to make Loans or otherwise extend credit to such Domestic Subsidiary as provided herein and (b) no Borrower Termination Agreement shall become effective as to any Subsidiary Borrower until all Loans made to and all amounts payable by such Subsidiary Borrower in respect of LC Disbursements, interest and/or fees (and, to the extent notified by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any other amounts payable under any Loan Document by such Subsidiary Borrower) shall have been paid in full,
provided
that such Borrower Termination Agreement shall be effective to terminate the right of such Subsidiary Borrower to request or receive further extensions of credit under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrower Joinder Agreement and a Guarantor Joinder Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.
SECTION 2.22.
Defaulting Lenders.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
 
61
 
 
(a) fees set forth in Section 2.12(a) shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender;
(b) the Commitment and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender;
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time; and

ARTICLE III
 
Representations and Warranties
Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:
SECTION 3.01.

Each Loan Party is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each Loan Document to which it is a party and to effect the Transactions and is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure to so qualify, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.02.
Authorization; Enforceability.
The Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party and the execution, delivery and performance by any Loan Party of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and, if required, action by the holders of such Loan Party's Equity Interests. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Borrower or such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
SECTION 3.03.
Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.
The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) filings with any Governmental Authority necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents and (ii) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any material Requirement of Law applicable to any Borrower or any Subsidiary to the extent failure to comply with which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) will not violate the charter, by-laws or other organization documents of any Borrower or any Subsidiary, (d) will not violate or result in a material default under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon any Borrower or any Subsidiary or their respective assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any material payment to be made by any Borrower or any Subsidiary or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any material obligation thereunder and (e) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than a Lien permitted under Section 6.02) on any asset of the Company or any Subsidiary.
 
63
 
 
SECTION 3.04.
Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.
(a) The Company has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2008, reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended December 27, 2008 (and comparable period for the prior fiscal year).

It is understood that neither the financial results of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended December 27, 2008, nor the losses associated with the Company's hedging activities during such fiscal quarter in themselves constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
(c) The fair value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (both at fair valuation and at present fair saleable value) is greater than the total amount of liabilities (including contingent and unliquidated liabilities) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries are able to pay all their liabilities as such liabilities mature and do not have unreasonably small capital with which to carry on their business. In computing the amount of contingent or unliquidated liabilities at any time, such liabilities will be computed at the amount which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

(b) Each Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries does not infringe in any material respect upon the rights of any other Person.
SECTION 3.06.
Litigation and Environmental Matters.
(a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of any Borrower or any Subsidiary, threatened against or affecting any Borrower or any Subsidiary (i) as to which there is a reasonable likelihood of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.
(b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, none of the Borrowers nor any Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, registration or license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any pending or threatened claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any conditions or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to form the basis for any Environmental Liability.

Compliance with Laws and Agreements.

The Company and each of the Subsidiaries (a) has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have been filed, except to the extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (b) except to the extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except any Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings,
provided
that the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has set aside on its books adequate reserves therefor in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as such may be amended, supplemented or replaced, "FIN 48"), and the failure to pay such Taxes could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No material Tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect to any Taxes.
SECTION 3.10.
ERISA.
No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan have been satisfied, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.11.
Disclosure.
None of (i) the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 27, 2008 or its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2008, and the other filings of the Company made with the SEC in 2008 or 2009 (collectively, the "

provided
that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrowers represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed by them to be reasonable at the time delivered (unless otherwise updated subsequent thereto, in which case such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed by it to be reasonable at the time updated).
SECTION 3.12.
Insurance.
Schedule 3.12 sets forth a description of all insurance (including self-insurance) maintained by or on behalf of the Loan Parties as of the Effective Date.

The properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries are insured with insurance companies having a financial strength rating of at least A by A.M. Best Company or through self-insurance and the Company believes that such insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries is adequate.
SECTION 3.13.
Security Interest in Collateral.
The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents create legal and valid Liens on all the Collateral in favor of the Administrative
 
65
 
 
Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and, for so long as UCC financing statements or deposit account control agreements, as the case may be, with respect to such Collateral have not been terminated by the Administrative Agent (or otherwise amended by the Administrative Agent in a manner that adversely affects the Lien in favor of the Secured Parties thereby perfected), such Liens constitute perfected and continuing Liens on the Collateral, securing the Secured Obligations, enforceable against the applicable Loan Party and all third parties, and having priority over all other Liens on the Collateral except in the case of Liens permitted under clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 6.02, to the extent any such Liens would have priority over the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to any applicable law.

All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, to the extent the failure of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters). The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.
SECTION 3.16.
Subsidiaries.
Schedule 3.16
sets forth, as of the Effective Date, (a) a correct and complete list of the name and relationship to the Company of each and all of the Company's Subsidiaries, (b) a true and complete listing of each class of authorized Equity Interests of each Borrower (other than the Company), of which all of such issued shares are validly issued, outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable (to the extent such concepts are applicable), and owned beneficially and of record by the Persons identified on

that (A) the Company shall not be required to deliver any certificate under clause (i) prior to the certificate to be delivered in respect of the period ending August 31, 2009, unless a Commencement Date shall occur prior to such date, in which case the Company shall prepare and provide such a certificate with respect to the Test Period then in effect as soon as practicable but in any event within 30 days after the last day of such Test Period, (B) during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the date of delivery of the certificate under clause (i) for the period ending August 31, 2009, unless the Company shall have delivered the certificate under clause (i) for the Test Period then in effect, (1) no Borrowing may be made (other than a deemed Borrowing under Section 2.18(e)), and no Letter of Credit may be issued, amended, renewed or extended if after giving effect thereto Availability would be less than the greater of (x) 15% of the Total Commitment and (y) $150,000,000, and (2) no action may be taken that requires that the Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for such Test Period be at least 1.25 to 1.00 and (C) no Default or Event of Default shall arise as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken in reliance on calculations set forth in a certificate delivered under clause (i) in respect of any Test Period that showed the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to be not less than, as applicable, 1.10 to 1.00 or 1.25 to 1.00 notwithstanding that the augmenting calculations in respect of such Test Period in a certificate delivered under clause (ii) show that the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was in fact less than, as applicable, 1.10 to 1.00 or 1.25 to 1.00 so long as the difference is due solely to fiscal quarter-end or fiscal year-end adjustments (it being understood, for the avoidance of
 
90
 
 
doubt, that this clause (C) is not intended to prevent the occurrence of an Event of Default arising under paragraph (a) notwithstanding that the failure to meet the 1.10 to 1.00 test may be due to the effect of such adjustments).
SECTION 6.13.
Changes in Fiscal Periods.
No Loan Party will change its fiscal year or change its method of determining fiscal quarters.

(h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) bankruptcy, liquidation, winding up, dissolution, reorganization, examination, suspension of general operations or other relief in respect of a Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Loan Party or its debts, or of a substantial part of their assets, under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for a Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Loan party or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed or unstayed for 90 days or more or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered;

Upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, exercise any rights and remedies provided to the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the UCC.
ARTICLE VIII
 
The Administrative Agent
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Loan Parties or any Subsidiary of a Loan Party or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as
 
93
 
 
directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary or believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Loan Party that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02 or believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be necessary) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, genuineness or accuracy of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of Liens on the Collateral or the existence of the Collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any representation, notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts, other than to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction determines by final and nonappealable judgment liability to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time upon notice to the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company in the absence of a continuing Event of Default, to appoint a successor. If no successor
 
94
 
 
shall have been so appointed by the Company and the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent that shall be a commercial bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such commercial bank, in either case, acceptable to the Company in the absence of a continuing Event of Default (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, obligations and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Each Lender hereby agrees that (a) it has requested a copy of each Report prepared by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent; (b) the Administrative Agent (i) makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the completeness or accuracy of any Report or any of the information contained therein or any inaccuracy or omission contained in or relating to a Report and (ii) shall not be liable for any information contained in any Report; (c) the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, and that any Person performing any field examination will inspect only specific information regarding the Loan Parties and will rely significantly upon the Loan Parties' books and records, as well as on representations of the Loan Parties' personnel and that the Administrative Agent undertakes no obligation to update, correct or supplement the Reports; (d) it will keep all Reports confidential and strictly for its internal use, not share the Report with any Loan Party or any other Person except as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement; and (e) without limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, it will pay and protect, and indemnify, defend, and hold the Administrative Agent and any such other Person preparing a Report harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred as the direct or indirect result of any third parties who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.
The Administrative Agent agrees that in the event it fails to fund its portion of any Borrowing or any portion of its participation in any Letter of Credit within three Business Days of the date on which it shall have been required to fund same, it will cooperate with efforts to replace it with a new Administrative Agent (including resigning in connection with such replacement).
Each Lender hereby authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into and perform each intercreditor agreement contemplated by Section 6.02(xviii).

SECTION 9.02.
Waivers; Amendments.
(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice to or demand on the Company or any Loan Party in any case shall entitle the Company or any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b) Except as provided in Section 2.20 with respect to any Commitment Increase, neither this Agreement nor Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (
provided
that the Administrative Agent may make Protective Advances as set forth in Section 2.05); (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce or forgive any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce or forgive the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change the order of payments specified in Section 2.10(b) or Section 2.18(c) or change Section 2.18(f) or (g) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" or "Supermajority Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of
 
97
 
 
each Lender (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Commitments), (vi) permit any Loan Party to assign its rights hereunder, release any Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Security Agreement (except as expressly provided in the Security Agreement or this Agreement) or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee, release all or substantially all the Collateral from the Liens of the Collateral Documents, or change the advance rates referenced in the definition of Borrowing Base, without the written consent of each Lender or (vii) change the definition of Borrowing Base or any eligibility criteria incorporated therein, in each case, where such change would have the effect of increasing Availability, or modify the $600,000,000 Credit Exposures threshold contained in Section 5.11 or Section 5.12 or clause (2) of Section 5.01(f), or contractually subordinate the Liens of the Administrative Agent under any Collateral Document without the written consent of the Supermajority Lenders at such time;
provided
further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent may also amend the
Commitment Schedule
to reflect assignments entered into pursuant to Section 9.04.
(c) In connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or termination (a "
Proposed Change
") requiring the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender, if the consent of Lenders having Credit Exposures and unused Commitments representing at least 66% of the sum of the total Credit Exposure and unused Commitments at such time shall be obtained, but the consent to such Proposed Change of other Lenders whose consent is required shall not be obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but has not been obtained being referred to as a "
Non-Consenting Lender
"), then, the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Non-Consenting Lender and the Administrative Agent, require each Non-Consenting Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee acceptable to the Company that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) after giving effect to such assignment (and any simultaneous assignments by other Non-Consenting Lenders), sufficient consents shall have been obtained to effect such Proposed Change, (iii) such Non-Consenting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Loan Parties (in the case of all other amounts) and (iv) the Loan Parties or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 9.04(b).
SECTION 9.03.
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a) The Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including expenses incurred in connection with due diligence) incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel selected by the Administrative Agent and of such special and local counsel as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in its good faith discretion, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions of the Loan Documents (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by any Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the
 
98
 
 
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout or restructuring (and related negotiations) in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit and (iv) all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent associated with collateral monitoring, collateral reviews and appraisals (including reasonable fees and expenses of advisors and professionals engaged by the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers relating thereto).
(b) The Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders and each Lender and their affiliates and the respective Related Parties of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "
Indemnitee
") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee (
provided
that in connection therewith the Borrowers shall only be responsible for the fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel selected by the Administrative Agent and of such special and local counsel as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in its good faith discretion, except that if any indemnified person concludes that its interests conflict with those of other indemnified persons, the Borrowers shall also be responsible for the fees, charges and disbursements of separate counsel for such indemnified person), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Company or any Subsidiary arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Lender to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on, at, to or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by the Company or any Subsidiary, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Company or any Subsidiary and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto,
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee. This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
(c) To the extent that the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and without limiting the Borrowers' obligation to do so, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount,
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. The obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph (c) are subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(a) (which shall apply
mutatis

public information about the Loan Parties and their Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee's compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to clause (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03) and to any fees payable hereunder that have accrued for such Lender's account but have not yet been paid Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, the Issuing Lenders and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

101
 
 
Receiver but not a Permitted Fee Receiver, unless such Fee Receiver receives written consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent (which consent may be withheld in the Borrower's and the Administrative Agent's sole discretion) (such Person, a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it),
provided
that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) such participation shall not increase the obligations of any Loan Party under any Loan Document, except as contemplated below, and (D) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 2.17(d) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).
(iii) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents,
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to clauses (c)(iii) and (v) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender,
provided
that such Participant shall be subject to Sections 2.18(g) and 2.19 as though it were a Lender.
(iv) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the "
Participant Register
"). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(v) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 9.08 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent, provided that the Participant shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as
if it were an assignee under clause (b).
(vi) Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (a) has purchased a participation in the minimum amount of $10,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent ("
Voting Participant Notification
"), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a "
Voting Participant
") and (c) receives the prior written consent of the Company (on behalf of itself and the other Borrowers) and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or
 
102
 
 
withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an Assignee as set forth in
Exhibit A
hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation purchased. The Company and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph.
(d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Company or the Administrative Agent, pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or the Farm Credit Funding Corp. or to any other entity organized under the Farm Credit Act, as amended, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest,
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION 9.05.
Survival.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Company and the other Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters or Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
SECTION 9.06.
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the syndication of the Loans and Commitments constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or by other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
SECTION 9.07.
Severability.
Any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
103

106
 
 
made on behalf of any Borrower by the Company shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such Borrower and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Borrower to the same extent as it if the same had been made directly by such Borrower. The Company (or any successor Company permitted pursuant to this Section 9.17) shall not be permitted to resign as the Company and the Borrowers shall not be permitted to remove the Company (or any successor Company permitted pursuant to this Section 9.17) as Company without the consent of the Administrative Agent,
provided
that if the Company notifies the Administrative Agent in writing that it (or any successor Company permitted pursuant to this Section 9.17) shall no longer be able to act as Company in accordance with the terms hereof, the Loan Parties shall appoint a successor to act as Company, which successor shall be a Borrower acceptable to the Administrative Agent (and the Borrowers hereby agree that such Person thereafter shall be vested with all rights, powers, privileges and authority of the Company hereunder).
