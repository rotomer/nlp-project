TYSON REPORTS SECOND QUARTER
AND SIX MONTHS RESULTS
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  May 4, 2009 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported the following results:
 
 
"Our loss of $0.24 per share from continuing operations in the second quarter includes $0.17 from a change in the method we used to recognize interim income taxes and $0.02 from a one-time charge for a prepared foods plant closure," said Leland Tollett, interim president and CEO of Tyson Foods. "Our Chicken segment has been profitable since the end of February, and I am pleased with the consistent progress we are making. We have improved our operational efficiencies, our product mix, and we are benefiting from lower grain costs and more favorable chicken prices. Our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments generated financial returns at or near normalized ranges in the second quarter, excluding one-time charges in Prepared Foods. Our tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year should be closer to normal, and we believe the operational recovery we are experiencing will be reflected in our results for the third and fourth quarters.
"It is too soon to predict the impact of the H1N1 outbreak. At this point, none of our pork plants are impacted by export bans. Our multi-protein, multi-sales channel business model puts us in a good position should consumers change which proteins they buy or where they buy them. Protein demand usually picks up as we move into the summer grilling season, and we are cautiously optimistic despite current conditions."

Chicken (37.4% of Net Sales  2nd Quarter 2009)
Chicken segment sales were $2.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2009. Operating loss was $46 million and $332 million, respectively, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2009. Sales and operating results were impacted positively by increased sales volume, partially offset by lower average sales prices. The increase in sales volume for both the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2009 was due to inventory reductions and sales volume related to recent acquisitions. The inventory reductions and recent acquisitions led to an overall decrease in average sales prices, as most of the inventory reduction related to commodity products shipped internationally and sales volume from recent acquisitions are on average lower priced products. Operating results were adversely impacted in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2009, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008, by a decline of $106 million and $321 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy purchases. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results. As compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008, operating results were also adversely impacted in the six months of fiscal 2009 by an increase in grain costs of $172 million, while we had a slight benefit from a reduction in grain costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

Operating income was $28 million in both the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2009. Operating results as compared to the same periods in 2008 were impacted positively by lower average live prices, offset by lower average sales prices and decreased sales volume. Operating results were impacted in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2009 by a decline of $6 million and an improvement of $35 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results. Operating results for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $25 million related to restructuring operations at the Emporia, Kansas, plant and an impairment of packaging equipment.

Operating results were impacted in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2009 by a decline of $17 million and $37 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live hogs as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008.
