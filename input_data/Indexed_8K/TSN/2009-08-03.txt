TYSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER
AND NINE MONTHS RESULTS
 
 
Springdale, Arkansas  August 3, 2009 -
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported the following results:
 
 
 
"Our earnings for the third quarter reflect a solid performance by all of our operating segments ," said Leland Tollett, interim president and chief executive officer of Tyson Foods. "In the midst of a slow economy and a challenging operating environment, we stayed focused and worked as a team to produce results within historical normalized ranges for each segment.
 
"I am encouraged by our progress in improving operational efficiencies in the Chicken segment, although we still have work to do," Tollett said. "Our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments continue to perform well. We also have been disciplined in managing working capital and have reduced inventory by a substantial amount in the second and third quarters.
 
"Soft demand for protein is likely to make the fourth quarter more challenging than the third quarter, but I'm feeling much better about our position than I would be if we were sitting on a lot of inventory," Tollett said. "Overall, I am very pleased with the direction we're headed and with the attitude of our team members to get the job done."

Chicken (36.3% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2009)
Chicken segment sales were $2.4 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009. Operating income was $143 million and operating loss was $189 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009. Sales and operating results were impacted positively by increased sales volume, as well as higher average sales prices. The increase in sales volume for both the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009 was due to inventory reductions and sales volume related to recent acquisitions. The inventory reductions and recent acquisitions diluted the average sales price changes, as most of the inventory reduction related to commodity products shipped internationally and sales volume from recent acquisitions are on average lower priced products. Operating results were also positively impacted by operational improvements, which included: yield, mix and live production performance improvements; adding processing flexibility; and reducing interplant product movement. Operating results were adversely impacted in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008, by a decline of $68 million and $389 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy purchases. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results. As compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008, operating results were positively impacted in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 by a decrease in grain costs of $91 million, while results were adversely impacted in the nine months of fiscal 2009 by an increase in grain costs of $81 million. Operating results for the nine months of fiscal 2008 included charges of $13 million related to closing our Wilkesboro, North Carolina, cooked products plant.
 
Beef (41.0% of Net Sales  3rd Quarter 2009)

Operating income was $66 million and $94 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009. Operating results as compared to the same periods in 2008 were impacted positively by lower average live prices, partially offset by lower average sales prices. Operating results were positively impacted in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009 by $82 million and $117 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results.

Operating income was $28 million and $112 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009. Operating results as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2008 were impacted positively by lower average live prices, offset in the third quarter by lower average sales prices. Operating results were impacted in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2009 by an improvement of $2 million and a decline of $35 million, respectively, from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live hogs as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008.

Operating results for the nine months of fiscal 2009 included charges of $15 million related to closing our Ponca City, Oklahoma, processed meats plant.
