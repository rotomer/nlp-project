Any such termination without cause is subject to the Companys obligation to continue to pay base salary for a period of three years after the date of termination, and the Company will treat Mr. Lochners stock options and restricted stock as provided in their respective award agreements. If Mr. Lochner is terminated without cause, he will not be entitled to any annual bonus award for the year in which he is terminated.
Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in Mr. Lochners employment agreement), all previously granted restricted stock and stock option awards which are unvested at the time of the change in control will vest sixty (60) days after the change in control event occurs.  If Mr. Lochner is terminated within that sixty (60) day period following a change in control, all such equity awards will vest immediately.

(a)           Executive shall receive, in addition to all regular compensation for services as described in Section 3 of this Agreement, as additional consideration for signing this Agreement and for agreeing to abide and be bound by the terms, provisions and restrictions of this Section 8, the following:
(i)           An  award of 118,670.8861 shares of Tyson Foods, Inc. Class A Common Stock (Common Stock) subject to the terms and conditions of a restricted stock agreement currently in use by the Employer for awards to executives generally (referred to herein as Restricted Stock).

(ii)           During Executives Period of Employment, on grant dates to be specified by Employer, which Employer expects to be consistent with Employers past practices for grants of options to Executives generally, an annual grant of at least 400,000 options on each such grant date to purchase shares of Common Stock (referred to herein as Stock Options), subject to the terms and conditions of the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan or any subsequent equity plan adopted by the Employer (Stock Plan), and the option grant agreement then in use on the date of grant by the Employer for executives generally.
(iii)           A grant of 282,320 Stock Options on the date that is four (4) business days after Employer releases its earnings for its fiscal first quarter of 2010, subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan, and the option grant agreement then in use on the date of grant by the Employer for executives generally.
(b)           Executive recognizes that, as a result of Executives employment with the Employer, Executive has had and will continue to have access to confidential information in multiple forms, electronic or otherwise, and such confidential information may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets; proprietary information; intellectual property; other documents, data, and information concerning methods, processes, controls, techniques, formulas, production, distribution, purchasing, financial analysis, returns and reports; information regarding other Executives as further discussed in Section 8(f); customer lists; supplier lists; vendor lists; and other sensitive information and data regarding the customers, suppliers, vendors, services, sales, pricing, and costs of Employer which is the property of and integral to the operations and success of Employer.  Executive agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 8, which Executive agrees and acknowledges to be reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate and important business interests and concerns of Employer regarding such confidential information.  Executive acknowledges that the information referred to above has independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.  Executive further acknowledges that Employer has taken all reasonable steps under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy and/or confidentiality of such information.
(c)           Executive agrees that Executive will not divulge to any person, nor use to the detriment of Employer, nor use in any business or process of manufacture in Direct Competition (defined is Section 8(e)) with Employer, at any time during Period of Employment or thereafter, any of the trade secrets and/or other confidential information of the Employer, whether in electronic form or otherwise, without first obtaining the express written permission of Employer. A trade secret shall include any information maintained as confidential and used by Employer in its business, including but not limited to a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that has value, actual or potential, from its confidentiality and from not being readily ascertainable to others who could also obtain value from such information.  For purposes of this Section 8, the compilation of information used by Employer in its business shall include, without limitation, the identity of customers and suppliers and information reflecting their interests, preferences, credit-worthiness, likely receptivity to solicitation for participation in various transactions and related information obtained during the course of Executives employment with Employer.
(d)           Executive agrees that at the time of leaving the employ of Employer, Executive will deliver to Employer, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all originals and copies, electronic or hard copy, of notebooks, memoranda, documents, communications, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the business of Employer, or constituting property of the Employer.  Executive further agrees that Executive will not, directly or indirectly, request or advise any customers or suppliers of Employer to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with Employer.
(e)           Executive agrees that during Executives Period of Employment and for a period of one (1) year after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive the expiration of the Period of Employment), Executive will not directly or indirectly, in the United States, participate in any Position (defined below) in any business in Direct Competition (defined below) with any business of the Employer.  The term Direct Competition, as used in this section, shall mean any business that directly competes against any line of business in which Executive was actively engaged during Executives employment with the Employer.  The term Position, as used in this section, includes a partner, director, holder of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares, principal, executive, officer, manager or any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer, where Executive performs any duties which are substantially similar to those performed by the Executive during Executives employment with Employer.  Executive acknowledges that a substantially similar position shall include any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer is one in which Executive might be able to utilize the valuable, proprietary and confidential information to which Executive was exposed during Executives employment with Employer.  It is acknowledged and agreed that the scope of the clause as set forth above is essential, because (i) a more restrictive definition of Position (e.g. limiting it to the same position with a competitor) will subject the Employer to serious, irreparable harm by allowing competitors to describe positions in ways to evade the operation of this clause, and substantially restrict the protection sought by Employer, and (ii) by allowing the Executive to escape the application of this clause by accepting a position designated as a lesser or different position with a competitor, the Employer is unable to restrict the Executive from providing valuable information to such competing entity to the harm of the Employer.
(f)           Executive recognizes that Executive possesses confidential information about other employees of Employer relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, salary and benefits, and interpersonal relationships with customers and suppliers of Employer.  Executive agrees that during Executives Period of Employment hereunder, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive, if applicable, the expiration of the Period of Employment), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee or agent of Employer, with a view to or for the purposes of inducing or encouraging such Executive or agent to leave the employ of Employer, for the purpose of being hired by Executive, any employer affiliated with Executive, or any competitor of Employer.  Executive agrees that Executive will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees to anyone.

(g)           Executive acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect Employers interest in this Agreement and that any breach thereof will result in an irreparable injury to Employer for which Employer has no adequate remedy at law.  Executive therefore agrees that, in the event  Executive breaches any of the provisions contained in this Section 8, Employer shall be authorized and entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction (i) a temporary restraining order, (ii) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,  (iii) an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such breach, (iv) direct, incidental and consequential damages arising from such breach; and/or (v) all reasonable legal fees and costs related to any actions taken by Employer to enforce Section 8.
(h)           Employer and Executive have attempted to specify a reasonable period of time, a reasonable area and reasonable restrictions to which this Section 8 shall apply.  Employer and Executive agree that if a court or administrative body should subsequently determine that the terms of this Section 8 are greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest, Employer agrees to waive those terms which are found by a court or administrative body to be greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest and to request that the court or administrative body reform this Agreement specifying a reasonable period of time and such other reasonable restrictions as the court or administrative body deems necessary.  Further, Executive agrees that Employer shall have the right to amend or modify this Section 8 as necessary to comport with the determination of any court or administrative body that such Section in this or a similar agreement entered into by Employer with any other officer or manager of Employer is greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest.
(i)           Executive further agrees that this Section 8, as well as Sections 11 and 12 relating to choice of law and forum for resolution, are integral parts of this Agreement, and that should a court fail or refuse to enforce the restrictions contained herein in the manner expressly provided in Sections 8(a) through 8(h) above, the Employer shall recover from Executive, and the court shall award to the Employer, the consideration (or a pro-rata portion thereof to the extent these provisions are enforced but the time frame is reduced beyond that specified above) provided to and elected by Executive under the terms of Section 8(a) above (or the monetary equivalent thereof), its cost and its reasonable attorneys fees.  Executive acknowledges that such award is not intended as liquidated damages and is not exclusive to other remedies available to Employer.  Instead such award is intended to ensure that Executive is not unjustly enriched as a result of retaining contract benefits not earned by Executive.
9.             During the Period of Employment, the Company shall make available to Executive the use of Company-owned assets (including use of Company-owned aircraft for up to 50 hours annually) in a manner consistent with the Companys then existing policies; provided that Officer's personal use of the Company-owned assets shall not interfere with Company use of such assets.  As part of such personal use of Company-owned aircraft, Executive may designate such number of additional passengers on such Company-owned aircraft as seating permits, and Executive need not be one of the passengers.  To the extent allowed under Company policy or practice, Employer will reimburse and gross-up Executive for any and all income tax liability (including interest and penalties) imposed upon Executive in connection with the receipt of the services and benefits set forth in this Section 9 in an amount sufficient so that the services and benefits will be provided hereunder without reduction for taxes.

In the event of Executives death or Disability, Executive, or Executives estate, as applicable, shall receive a prorated bonus for the portion of time worked during the fiscal year of the Employer in which termination under this Section 7(d) occurs, based upon the bonus received by Executive during the immediately prior fiscal year.

Temporary Suspension or Limitation of Payments
(i)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is a specified Executive within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (and the regulations thereunder) at the date of Executives separation from service, to the extent that all or a portion of any payments due under Section 7 of this Agreement (including, without limitation the payment of any salary continuation) exceeds the amount, if any, that can be paid as separation pay that does not constitute a deferral of compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (and the regulations thereunder), or that otherwise can be paid without resulting in a failure under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, payment shall be delayed until the later of six (6) months after the separation from service or the date the payment would otherwise be made under Section 7.  Any payments that are so delayed shall be paid in one lump sum during the seventh month following the date of the Executives separation from service.
(ii)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the total payments to be paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 7, along with any other payments to the Executive by the Employer, would result in the Executive being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Employer shall reduce the aggregate payments to the largest amount which can be paid to the Executive without triggering the excise tax, but only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in the Executive retaining larger aggregate after-tax payments.  The determination of the excise tax and the aggregate after-tax payments to be received by the Executive will be made by the Employer.  If payments are to be reduced, the payments made latest in time will be reduced first and if payments are to be made at the same time, non-cash payments will be reduced before cash payments.
8.           .
Additional Compensation, Confidential Information, Trade Secrets, Limitations on Solicitation and Non-Compete Clause
(a)           Executive shall receive, in addition to all regular compensation for services as described in Section 3 of this Agreement, as additional consideration for signing this Agreement and for agreeing to abide and be bound by the terms, provisions and restrictions of this Section 8, the following:
(i)           An award of 77,136.0759 shares of Tyson Foods, Inc. Class A Common Stock (Common Stock) subject to the terms and conditions of a restricted stock agreement currently in use by the Employer for awards to executives generally (referred to herein as Restricted Stock).
 
 
2
 
(ii)           During Executives Period of Employment, on grant dates to be specified by Employer, which Employer expects to be consistent with Employers past practices for grants of options to executives generally, an annual grant of at least 325,000 options on each such grant date to purchase shares of Common Stock (referred to herein as Stock Options), subject to the terms and conditions of the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan or any subsequent equity plan adopted by the Employer (Stock Plan), and the option grant agreement then in use on the date of grant by the Employer for executives generally.
(iii)           A grant of 275,000 Stock Options on the date that is four (4) business days after Employer releases its earnings for its fiscal first quarter of 2010, subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan, and the option grant agreement then in use on the date of grant by the Employer for executives generally.
(b)           Executive recognizes that, as a result of Executives employment with the Employer, Executive has had and will continue to have access to confidential information in multiple forms, electronic or otherwise, and such confidential information may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets; proprietary information; intellectual property; other documents, data, and information concerning methods, processes, controls, techniques, formulas, production, distribution, purchasing, financial analysis, returns and reports; information regarding other Executives as further discussed in Section 8(f); customer lists; supplier lists; vendor lists; and other sensitive information and data regarding the customers, suppliers, vendors, services, sales, pricing, and costs of Employer which is the property of and integral to the operations and success of Employer.  Executive agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 8, which Executive agrees and acknowledges to be reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate and important business interests and concerns of Employer regarding such confidential information.  Executive acknowledges that the information referred to above has independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.  Executive further acknowledges that Employer has taken all reasonable steps under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy and/or confidentiality of such information.
(c)           Executive agrees that Executive will not divulge to any person, nor use to the detriment of Employer, nor use in any business or process of manufacture in Direct Competition (defined is Section 8(e)) with Employer, at any time during Period of Employment or thereafter, any of the trade secrets and/or other confidential information of the Employer, whether in electronic form or otherwise, without first obtaining the express written permission of Employer. A trade secret shall include any information maintained as confidential and used by Employer in its business, including but not limited to a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that has value, actual or potential, from its confidentiality and from not being readily ascertainable to others who could also obtain value from such information.  For purposes of this Section 8, the compilation of information used by Employer in its business shall include, without limitation, the identity of customers and suppliers and information reflecting their interests, preferences, credit-worthiness, likely receptivity to solicitation for participation in various transactions and related information obtained during the course of Executives employment with Employer.
(d)           Executive agrees that at the time of leaving the employ of Employer, Executive will deliver to Employer, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all originals and copies, electronic or hard copy, of notebooks, memoranda, documents, communications, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the business of Employer, or constituting property of the Employer.  Executive further agrees that Executive will not, directly or indirectly, request or advise any customers or suppliers of Employer to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with Employer.
(e)           Executive agrees that during Executives Period of Employment and for a period of one (1) year after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive the expiration of the Period of Employment), Executive will not directly or indirectly, in the United States, participate in any Position (defined below) in any business in Direct Competition (defined below) with any business of the Employer.  The term Direct Competition, as used in this section, shall mean any business that directly competes against any line of business in which Executive was actively engaged during Executives employment with the Employer.  The term Position, as used in this section, includes a partner, director, holder of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares, principal, executive, officer, manager or any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer, where Executive performs any duties which are substantially similar to those performed by the Executive during Executives employment with Employer.  Executive acknowledges that a substantially similar position shall include any employment or consulting position with an entity in Direct Competition with Employer is one in which Executive might be able to utilize the valuable, proprietary and confidential information to which Executive was exposed during Executives employment with Employer.  It is acknowledged and agreed that the scope of the clause as set forth above is essential, because (i) a more restrictive definition of Position (e.g. limiting it to the same position with a competitor) will subject the Employer to serious, irreparable harm by allowing competitors to describe positions in ways to evade the operation of this clause, and substantially restrict the protection sought by Employer, and (ii) by allowing the Executive to escape the application of this clause by accepting a position designated as a lesser or different position with a competitor, the Employer is unable to restrict the Executive from providing valuable information to such competing entity to the harm of the Employer.
(f)           Executive recognizes that Executive possesses confidential information about other employees of Employer relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, salary and benefits, and interpersonal relationships with customers and suppliers of Employer.  Executive agrees that during Executives Period of Employment hereunder, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the Period of Employment (it is expressly acknowledged that this clause is intended to survive, if applicable, the expiration of the Period of Employment), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee or agent of Employer, with a view to or for the purposes of inducing or encouraging such Executive or agent to leave the employ of Employer, for the purpose of being hired by Executive, any employer affiliated with Executive, or any competitor of Employer.  Executive agrees that Executive will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees to anyone.
 
 
3
 
(g)           Executive acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect Employers interest in this Agreement and that any breach thereof will result in an irreparable injury to Employer for which Employer has no adequate remedy at law.  Executive therefore agrees that, in the event  Executive breaches any of the provisions contained in this Section 8, Employer shall be authorized and entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction (i) a temporary restraining order, (ii) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,  (iii) an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such breach, (iv) direct, incidental and consequential damages arising from such breach; and/or (v) all reasonable legal fees and costs related to any actions taken by Employer to enforce Section 8.
(h)           Employer and Executive have attempted to specify a reasonable period of time, a reasonable area and reasonable restrictions to which this Section 8 shall apply.  Employer and Executive agree that if a court or administrative body should subsequently determine that the terms of this Section 8 are greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest, Employer agrees to waive those terms which are found by a court or administrative body to be greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest and to request that the court or administrative body reform this Agreement specifying a reasonable period of time and such other reasonable restrictions as the court or administrative body deems necessary.  Further, Executive agrees that Employer shall have the right to amend or modify this Section 8 as necessary to comport with the determination of any court or administrative body that such Section in this or a similar agreement entered into by Employer with any other officer or manager of Employer is greater than reasonably necessary to protect Employers interest.
(i)           Executive further agrees that this Section 8, as well as Sections 11 and 12 relating to choice of law and forum for resolution, are integral parts of this Agreement, and that should a court fail or refuse to enforce the restrictions contained herein in the manner expressly provided in Sections 8(a) through 8(h) above, the Employer shall recover from Executive, and the court shall award to the Employer, the consideration (or a pro-rata portion thereof to the extent these provisions are enforced but the time frame is reduced beyond that specified above) provided to and elected by Executive under the terms of Section 8(a) above (or the monetary equivalent thereof), its cost and its reasonable attorneys fees.  Executive acknowledges that such award is not intended as liquidated damages and is not exclusive to other remedies available to Employer.  Instead such award is intended to ensure that Executive is not unjustly enriched as a result of retaining contract benefits not earned by Executive.
9.             During the Period of Employment, the Company shall make available to Executive the use of Company-owned assets (including use of Company-owned aircraft for up to 50 hours annually) in a manner consistent with the Companys then existing policies; provided that Officer's personal use of the Company-owned assets shall not interfere with Company use of such assets.  As part of such personal use of Company-owned aircraft, Executive may designate such number of additional passengers on such Company-owned aircraft as seating permits, and Executive need not be one of the passengers.  To the extent allowed under Company policy or practice, Employer will reimburse and gross-up Executive for any and all income tax liability (including interest and penalties) imposed upon Executive in connection with the receipt of the services and benefits set forth in this Section 9 in an amount sufficient so that the services and benefits will be provided hereunder without reduction for taxes.

13.           .  The courts of Washington County, Arkansas shall have exclusive jurisdiction and be the venue of all disputes between the Employer and Executive, whether such disputes arise from this Agreement or otherwise.  In addition, Executive expressly waives any right Executive may have to sue or be sued in the county of Executives residence and consents to venue in Washington County, Arkansas.
