Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported the following results:
Springdale, Arkansas  February 5, 2010 
With more than half a billion dollars in operating cash flow, we generated a record first quarter EPS of $0.42 and drove down net debt by $400 million, said Donnie Smith, Tysons president and chief executive officer.  Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods continued to execute well, and Chicken began to show the improvement weve been working toward for more than a year, Smith said.  Our team members did a great job of staying focused and making progress week after week.  Were developing momentum that I believe will continue through the year and into 2011.
