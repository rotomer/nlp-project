Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported the following results:
Springdale, Arkansas  August 9, 2010 
This was a fantastic quarter for Tyson Foods, with record earnings, sales and operating margin, said Donnie Smith, Tysons president and chief executive officer.  With more than $600 million in operating cash flow, we were able to pay down debt by $400 million while continuing to invest in our business, bringing our debt to its lowest level since 2001.
The Beef and Pork segments posted phenomenal results with record return on sales, Smith said.  Chicken continued to improve and performed within its normalized range. Prepared Foods struggled with rapidly rising input costs, but still managed a decent return.
Looking ahead, our operational improvements and lower interest expense will help us finish 2010 in a great position and give us a strong start to 2011.
