Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported the following results:
Springdale, Arkansas  November 22, 2010 
Our results this quarter and this year are directly due to our diversified protein business models and  our operational improvements, which have raised the level of expectations for Tysons performance, said Donnie Smith, president and chief executive officer of Tyson Foods.
We produced record sales and earnings despite some market headwinds, Smith said.  Operating margins for the year were in or above their normalized ranges in each of our four segments. We generated more than $1.5 billion in operating income.  Strong cash flows allowed us to repurchase or redeem nearly $1.0 billion of notes in the fiscal year. This reduced gross debt to $2.5 billion and net debt to $1.6 billion, bringing our debt to its lowest level in nearly a decade.
Were just over halfway through our first quarter of fiscal 2011, and it is shaping up to be a strong quarter and another good year, Smith said. There are always challenging market conditions to manage. Thats the norm in our business, and were prepared to address them.
 
 
 
Our accounting cycle resulted in a 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week year in fiscal 2010, as compared to a 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week year in fiscal 2009.
