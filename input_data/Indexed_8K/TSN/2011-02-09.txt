Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
On February 4, 2011, the annual meeting of shareholders of Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") was held.  Matters voted on by shareholders included (i) the election of directors of the Company's board, (ii) ratification of the Company's selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 1, 2011, (iii) a shareholder proposal to phase in controlled-atmosphere killing within five years ("Shareholder Proposal"), (iv) consideration and approval of an advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Companys named executive officers, and (v) consideration and action upon an advisory vote on the frequency at which the Company should include an advisory vote regarding the compensation of the Companys named executive officers in its proxy statement for shareholder consideration.  The final voting results of the shareholders' votes are reported below.
 
 
 
 
 
Based on these results and consistent with a majority of votes cast with respect to this matter, the Companys board of directors has adopted a policy to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every three years.
