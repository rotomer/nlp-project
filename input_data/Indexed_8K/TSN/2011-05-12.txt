Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On May 11, 2011, the board of directors Tyson Foods, Inc. (the Company) reactivated a program, effective immediately, to repurchase up to approximately 22.5 million shares of the Companys Class A common stock.
 
The program permits the Company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation. The timing and extent to which the Company repurchases its shares will depend upon, among other things, market conditions, liquidity targets, the Company's debt obligations, and regulatory requirements. The Company intends to begin repurchasing shares during its fiscal third quarter of 2011; however, the amount to be repurchased during this quarter is expected to be less than 25% of the total authorization. Decisions to repurchase additional shares in subsequent quarters will also be made based upon the factors identified above.
 
The program may be suspended or discontinued any time.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
