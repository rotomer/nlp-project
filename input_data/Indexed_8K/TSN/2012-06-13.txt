Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Company") expects to close the previously announced public offering and sale of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.500% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes") on June 13, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering and sale of the Notes to fund the repurchase of any and all of its outstanding 10.50% Senior Notes due 2014 through the previously announced cash tender offer and any related redemption, including, in each case, the payment of accrued interest thereon and any applicable premiums related thereto, and certain related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes.
The Notes will be jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantees" and, together with the Notes, the "Securities") by each of the Company's existing wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") under the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 9, 2009, as amended and restated as of February 23, 2011 and as further amended June 4, 2012 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, as of the settlement date with respect to the Notes. The Securities have been offered pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement, dated June 6, 2012, to the Prospectus dated June 6, 2012, filed as part of the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181918) that became effective when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 6, 2012.
The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June 1, 1995 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.)), as successor trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of June 13, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.500%. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2012, to the persons in whose names such Notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding June 1 or December 1, as the case may be (whether or not a business day). Interest that the Company pays on the maturity date will be paid to the person to whom the principal will be payable. The amount of interest payable on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022.
A Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its obligations under its respective Guarantee upon the release or discharge of all guarantees and indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor outstanding as of the settlement date for the Notes (i) under the Credit Agreement and (ii) in relation to any indebtedness of the Company, or upon the earlier occurrence of certain other customary circumstances as described in the Prospectus Supplement pursuant to which the Securities have been offered. The Notes and the Guarantees by the Subsidiary Guarantors are the general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. They rank equally in right of payment with the existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors.
The Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to March 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date) at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption, or (ii) the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to its present value as of the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. At any time on or after March 15, 2022, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption.
If the Company experiences a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
 
The Indenture includes certain restrictive covenants, including covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur secured debt, enter into sale and lease-back transactions and consolidate, merge or transfer substantially all of the Company's assets to another entity. The covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable.
The foregoing descriptions of the Supplemental Indenture and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Supplemental Indenture and the form of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2022, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference herein. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Sidley Austin LLP, Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, PLLC, McAfee & Taft, Husch Blackwell LLP and Bryan Cave LLP provided the Company with the legal opinions attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5, respectively.
 
The description contained under Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 2.03.

Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co.

LLC ("Morgan Stanley") and RBC Capital Markets, LLC ("RBC") and each of the other Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), for whom J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and RBC are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective principal amounts set forth in Schedule A hereto of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.500% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 1, 1995 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture"), dated as of the Closing Time (as defined below), among the Company, the subsidiaries of the Company set forth in Schedule B hereto (collectively, the "Guarantors") and the Trustee, relating to the Securities. The Base Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture."

The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representatives deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-181918), including the related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses, which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "1933 Act Regulations") under the 1933 Act. Such registration statement covers the registration of the Securities under the 1933 Act. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B ("Rule 430B") of the 1933 Act Regulations and paragraph (b) of Rule 424 ("Rule 424(b)") of the 1933 Act Regulations. Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information." Each prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a "preliminary prospectus." Such registration statement, at any given time, including any amendments thereto to such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by 1933 Act Regulations, is herein called the "Registration Statement."

For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

Actions against Parties; Notification
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a) (ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such
Contribution
 
indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or any Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Each of the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director or officer of the Company or a Guarantor and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or such Guarantor, as appropriate. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company, and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
SECTION 9. .
Termination of Agreement
(a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) or the General Disclosure Package, a Material Adverse Change, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) (A) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or (B) if trading generally on the NYSE Amex, the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement, or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.
Termination; General
(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:

(b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.

SECTION 8.02. . Any term or provision of the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby Guaranteed without rendering the Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Successors and Assigns
SECTION 8.04. . Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 8 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 8 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver
SECTION 8.05. . No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 8, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Modification
SECTION 8.06. . A Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its obligations under this Article 8 (other than any obligation that may have arisen under Section 8.07 hereof):

Re:
Registration Statement on Form S-3
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We are acting as special counsel to IBP Redevelopment Corporation, a Missouri corporation, Tyson Farms, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, and Carolina Brand Foods, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). We refer to the Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-181918 (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Tyson Foods, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the parent corporation of the Subsidiary Guarantors (the "Parent"), and by certain subsidiaries of the Parent (including the Subsidiary Guarantors) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which Registration Statement became effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Registration Statement, (i) the Parent is issuing $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.500% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes") and (ii) the Subsidiary Guarantors, and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent, are providing guarantees of the Notes (the "Guarantees" and, together with the Notes, the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 1995 (the "Base Indenture") between the Parent and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee") to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.), the original trustee, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture dated June 13, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture") relating to the Notes. The Base Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture is hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture." The Securities are to be sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated June 6, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Parent, the guarantor subsidiaries and the Underwriters named therein.
This opinion letter is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
In connection herewith, we have reviewed:
 
 
 
Exhibit 5.5
 
 
 
 
 
The documents referenced as items (1) through (4) above are collectively referred to herein as the "Transaction Documents."
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such other corporate or analogous records, agreements and instruments of the Subsidiary Guarantors, certificates of public officials and officers of the Subsidiary Guarantors, and such other documents, records and instruments, and we have made such legal and factual inquiries, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for us to render the opinions hereinafter expressed. In our examination of the Transaction Documents and the foregoing, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal competence and capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied without independent investigation as to matters of fact upon statements of governmental officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Transaction Documents and certificates and statements of appropriate representatives of the Subsidiary Guarantors.
In connection herewith, we have assumed that, other than with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors, all of the Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by, have been duly executed and delivered by, and constitute the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of, all of the parties to such Transaction Documents, all of the signatories to such Transaction Documents have been duly authorized and all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform such Transaction Documents.
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Guarantee by any Subsidiary Guarantor will constitute the valid and binding obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor when the Notes are duly executed by duly authorized officers of the Parent and duly authenticated by the Trustee, all in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement.
In addition to the assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth above, the opinions set forth herein are further limited by, subject to and based upon the following assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions:
(a) Our opinions herein reflect only the application of applicable Missouri and North Carolina law (excluding the securities and blue sky laws of such States, as to which we express no opinion). The opinions set forth herein are made as of the date hereof and are subject to, and may be limited by, future changes in the factual matters set forth herein, and we undertake no duty to advise you of the same. The opinions expressed herein are based upon the law in effect (and published or otherwise generally available) on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement these opinions should such law be changed by legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise. In rendering our opinions, we have not considered, and hereby disclaim any opinion as to, the application or impact of any laws, cases, decisions, rules or regulations of any other jurisdiction, court or administrative agency.
 
(b) Our opinions contained herein may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or similar laws affecting or relating to the rights and remedies of creditors generally including, without limitation, laws relating to fraudulent transfers or conveyances, preferences and equitable subordination, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
(c) Our opinions are further subject to the effect of generally applicable rules of law arising from statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and the rules and regulations of governmental authorities that: (i) limit or affect the enforcement of provisions of a contract that purport to require waiver of the obligations of good faith, fair dealing, diligence and reasonableness; (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; (iii) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating, or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct; (iv) may, where less than all of the contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange; and (v) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees.
(d) We express no opinion as to:
(i) the enforceability of any provision in the Indenture or the Guarantees purporting or attempting to (A) confer exclusive jurisdiction and/or venue upon certain courts or otherwise waive the defenses of or improper venue, (B) waive the right of the Subsidiary Guarantors or any other person to a trial by jury, (C) provide that remedies are cumulative or that decisions by a party are conclusive (D) modify or waive the rights to notice, legal defenses, statutes of limitations or other benefits that cannot be waived under applicable law, or (E) govern choice of law or conflicts of laws; or
forum non conveniens
(ii) the enforceability of any rights to indemnification or contribution provided for in the Transaction Documents which are violative of public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any Federal or state securities law, rule or regulation) or the legality of such rights.
(e) We express no opinion as to whether the Subsidiary Guarantor organized under the laws of Missouri may guarantee or otherwise be liable for indebtedness incurred by the Parent except to the extent that such Guarantor may be determined to have benefited from the incurrence of the indebtedness by the Parent or whether such benefit may be measured other than by the extent to which the proceeds of the indebtedness incurred by the Parent are, directly or indirectly, made available to such Guarantor for its corporate purposes.
(f) We call to your attention that enforcement of a guaranty by a Guarantor Subsidiary organized under the laws of North Carolina may be limited by the provisions of Chapter 26 of the North Carolina General Statutes and we express no opinion as to the effectiveness of any waiver by any such guarantor of his, her or its rights under such Chapter.
 
We do not render any opinions except as set forth above. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in the prospectus filed as a part thereof. We also consent to your filing copies of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement with agencies of such states as you deem necessary in the course of complying with the laws of such states regarding the offer and sale of the Debt Securities. In giving such consent, we do not thereby concede that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
