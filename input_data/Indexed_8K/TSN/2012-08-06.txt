TYSON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER
AND NINE MONTHS FISCAL
2012
RESULTS
Springdale, Arkansas 
August 6, 2012
Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), today reported the following results:
We produced solid results in our fiscal third quarter despite softer than expected domestic demand for protein, said Donnie Smith, president and chief executive officer of Tyson Foods. I am especially pleased with the performance of our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. Our Beef and Pork segments have been operating in very difficult market conditions that will result in our earnings for fiscal 2012 coming in lower than we previously projected.
Grain costs have been increasing significantly and rapidly, largely as a result of the on-going U.S. drought. While we ultimately expect to pass along rising input costs, these costs, coupled with continued soft demand, are likely to pressure earnings in 2013. However, we still anticipate solid earnings for the year, and we are performing well during challenging circumstances. With our strong balance sheet, customer relationships, new product development capabilities, and efficient operations, we believe Tyson Foods is in the best position in our industry to succeed now and in the future.
We're often faced with challenges in our business, but our strategy will allow us to manage through trying times for continued success. We are focused on growing our prepared foods, international poultry and value-added poultry businesses. We can't make it rain, but we can execute against our strategy by producing high quality foods using innovative and cost effective processes. It's tough right now, but I'm confident we will come out of this in even better shape than we are in today.
Segment Performance Review (in millions)
Outlook
Our continued capital investment in our businesses, strong liquidity and reduced interest expense will help us finish fiscal 2012 strong and put us in a good position as we begin fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, we expect overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to decrease slightly from fiscal 2012 levels. The recent drought conditions have reduced expected grain supplies, which will result in higher input costs as well as increased costs for cattle and hog producers. The following is a summary of the fiscal 2013 outlook for each of our segments:

Outlook Continued
Through the first nine months of fiscal 2012, we used cash and cash flows from operations to reinvest over $700 million back into our business through capital expenditures and share repurchases. The following is a summary of the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 for sales, capital expenditures, net interest expense, debt and liquidity and share repurchases:

EBITDA Reconciliations
(In millions)
(Unaudited)
EBITDA represents net income, net of interest, income tax and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe the presentation of this financial measure helps investors to assess our operating performance from period to period and enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. However, the measurement of EBITDA may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry, which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure. EBITDA is not a measure required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA. Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results, and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally, in making investment decisions.
