Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 9, 2012, Tyson Foods, Inc. (the 
Company
) entered into a Credit Agreement (the 
Credit Agreement
) with the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the 
Administrative Agent
), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Bank plc, CoBank, ACB, Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., Rabobank Nederland, New York Branch, and RBC Capital Markets, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, Bank of America, N.A. and Barclays Bank plc, as syndication agents, and CoBank, ACB, Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., Rabobank Nederland, New York Branch, and RBC Capital Markets, as documentation agents.  The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of $1 billion (of which $500 million is available for letters of credit).
The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate, on August 9, 2017.
The Credit Agreement is unsecured. However, if at any time (the 
Collateral Trigger Date
) the Company shall fail to have (a) a corporate rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (
Moody's
) of Ba1 or better, (b) a corporate rating from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC business (
S&P
), of BB+ or better, or (c) a corporate rating from Fitch Ratings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fimalac, S.A., of BB+ or better, the Company, any subsidiary that has guaranteed any material indebtedness of the Company, and substantially all of the Company's other domestic subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, the 
Grantors
) shall be required to secure the obligations under the credit agreement and related documents with a first-priority perfected security interest in the Company's and such Grantors' cash, deposit and securities accounts, accounts receivable and related assets, inventory (together with the grant of a license to use the Company's or such Grantors' intellectual property relating to such inventory) and proceeds of any of the foregoing (the 
Collateral Requirement
).  
If on any date prior to any Collateral Trigger Date the Company shall have (a) a corporate rating from Moody's of Baa2 or better, (b) a corporate rating from S&P of BBB or better and (c) a corporate rating from Fitch of BBB or better, in each case with stable or better outlook, then the Collateral Requirement will no longer be effective.
Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an annual rate of interest equal to (a) the Eurocurrency rate plus the applicable spread or (b) the alternate base rate plus the applicable spread, each as described below. The applicable spread will be the percentage described in the following chart that corresponds to the Company's corporate credit rating (or Credit Agreement rating, if available) from S&P, Moody's or Fitch, as applicable.
2
In the event the rating levels are split, the applicable spreads will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies, or, if all three rating agencies have different rating levels, the applicable spreads will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies.
The Company will pay a commission on letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement at a rate equal to the applicable spread for loans based upon the Eurocurrency rate, as well as fronting fees for letters of credit set forth in a fronting fee agreement between any issuing lender and the Company.  The Company has agreed to pay certain other fees with respect to the Credit Agreement, including facility fees based on the lenders' commitments at the rates depicted in the above table and customary annual administration fees.
If at any time the Company's outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement (including outstanding letters of credit) exceed the aggregate revolving commitments as in effect at such time, the Company will be required to prepay an amount equal to such excess, unless the aggregate revolving and swingline borrowings are less than such excess, in which case the Company is required to deposit cash equal to such excess in an account maintained by the Administrative Agent.
Subject to certain conditions and restrictions, the Credit Agreement will allow the Company to voluntarily reduce from time to time the amount of the revolving commitments and to prepay the loans. The Credit Agreement will also, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, allow the Company to request from time to time increases in the amount of the revolving commitments in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate.
The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the Company's ability (as well as those of the Company's subsidiaries) to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of the Company's business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale-leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.
In addition, the Company will be required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios.
3
The Company's indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by the Company and Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. If in the future any other subsidiary of the Company shall guarantee any material indebtedness of the Company, such subsidiary shall also be required to guarantee the Company's indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default such as non-payment of obligations under the Credit Agreement, violation of affirmative or negative covenants, material inaccuracy of representations, defaults under other material debt, bankruptcy or insolvency, ERISA and judgment defaults, invalidity of the credit documents (or the Company's assertion of any such invalidity), change of control, failure of the guarantee to remain in full force and effect, and loss of lien perfection or priority following the Collateral Trigger Date.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is summary in nature and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and incorporated herein by reference.

(a) Each Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. Any Swingline Loan shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 2.04. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lenders failure to make Loans as required.
(b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan,
provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000;
provided
that an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Total Commitment or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.06(f). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is not less than $500,000;
provided
that a Swingline Loan may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire
27
unused balance of the Total Commitment. Borrowings of more than one Class and Type may be outstanding at the same time,
provided
that there shall not at any time be more than a total of ten Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Commitment Termination Date.
SECTION 2.03.
    
Requests for Revolving Borrowings.
To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing.

(vii) that as of such date the conditions set forth in Sections 4.02(a) and (b) are satisfied.
If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.

SECTION 2.04.
    
Swingline Loans.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrowers from time to time during the Availability Period;
provided
, that after giving effect thereto, (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans shall not exceed $50,000,000 and (ii) the total Credit Exposures shall not exceed the Total Commitment,
provided
that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.
28
(b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Company (on behalf of itself or, if applicable, the relevant Borrower) or the relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of such proposed Swingline Loan. Each such telephonic request shall be confirmed promptly by facsimile or other electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the name of the relevant Borrower, the requested date of the Swingline Loan (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of the requested Swingline Loan and the location and number of such Borrowers account to which funds are to be disbursed. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Company or the relevant Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the relevant Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of such Borrower maintained with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f), by remittance to the relevant Issuing Lender).
(c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the relevant Borrower (or other party on behalf of the relevant Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear,
provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to any Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrowers of any default in the payment thereof.
(d) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Swingline Lender, shall request settlement (a 
Settlement
) with the Lenders on at least a weekly basis or on any earlier date that the Administrative Agent elects, by notifying the Lenders of such requested Settlement by facsimile, telephone, or e-mail no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time on the date of such requested Settlement (the 
Settlement Date
). Each Lender (other than the Swingline Lender, in the case of the Swingline Loans) shall transfer the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the outstanding
29
principal amount of the applicable Loan with respect to which Settlement is requested to such account of the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may designate by not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Settlement Date. Settlements may occur during the existence of a Default and whether or not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have then been satisfied. Such amounts transferred to the Administrative Agent shall be applied against the amounts of the Swingline Lenders Swingline Loans and, together with the Swingline Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders, respectively. If any such amount is not transferred to the Administrative Agent by any Lender on such Settlement Date, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon as specified in Section 2.07.
SECTION 2.05.
    
Incremental Commitments.
(a)
The Company may on one or more occasions, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, request the establishment, during the Availability Period, of Incremental Commitments,
provided
that the aggregate amount of all the Incremental Commitments established hereunder shall not exceed $250,000,000 during the term of this Agreement. Each such notice shall specify (A) the date on which the Company proposes that the Incremental Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent and each Lender participating in the requested increase) after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent, and (B) the amount of the Incremental Commitments being requested (it being agreed that (x) any Lender approached to provide any Incremental Commitment may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Incremental Commitment and (y) any Person that the Company proposes to become an Incremental Lender, if such Person is not then a Lender, must be approved by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)).
(b) The terms and conditions (including the applicable facility fee and interest rate spreads) of any Incremental Commitment and Loans and other extensions of credit to be made thereunder shall be identical to those of the Commitments and Loans and other extensions of credit made hereunder, and shall be treated as a single Class with such Commitments and Loans;
provided
, that the Company at its election may pay upfront or closing fees with respect to Incremental Commitments without paying such fees with respect to the other Commitments.
(c) The Incremental Commitments shall be effected pursuant to one or more Incremental Facility Agreements executed and delivered by the Company, each Incremental Lender providing such Incremental Commitments and the Administrative Agent;
provided
that no Incremental Commitments shall become effective unless (i) on the date of effectiveness thereof, both immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to such Incremental Commitments, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) on the date of effectiveness thereof and after giving effect to the making of Loans and issuance of Letters of Credit thereunder to be made on such date, the representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in the Loan Documents that are qualified by materiality shall be true and correct and the representations and warranties that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties that are qualified by materiality shall be true and correct and such representations and warranties that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of such earlier date), (iii) the Company shall make any payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16 in connection with such Incremental Commitments and the related transactions under this Section, (iv) the Company shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent such legal opinions, board resolutions, secretarys certificates, officers certificates and other documents as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction and (v) each guarantor shall have reaffirmed its Guarantee of the Obligations. Each Incremental Facility Agreement may, without the consent of any Lender, effect such
30
amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section.
(d) Upon the effectiveness of an Incremental Commitment of any Incremental Lender not already a Lender, (i) such Incremental Lender shall be deemed to be a Lender hereunder, and henceforth shall be entitled to all the rights of, and benefits accruing to, Lenders hereunder and shall be bound by all agreements, acknowledgements and other obligations of Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii) (A) such Incremental Commitment shall constitute (or, in the event such Incremental Lender already has a Commitment, shall increase) the Commitment of such Incremental Lender and (B) the Total Commitment shall be increased by the amount of such Incremental Commitment, in each case, subject to further increase or reduction from time to time as set forth in the definition of the term Commitment. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Commitment, the Credit Exposure of the Incremental Lender holding such Commitment, and the Applicable Percentage of all the Lenders, shall automatically be adjusted to give effect thereto.
(e) On the date of effectiveness of any Incremental Commitments, (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding (the 
Existing Revolving Borrowings
) immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments shall be deemed to be repaid, (ii) each Incremental Lender that shall have had a Commitment prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Borrowings (as hereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Existing Revolving Borrowings, (iii) each Incremental Lender that shall not have had a Commitment prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments shall pay to Administrative Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Borrowings, (iv) after the Administrative Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference, if positive, between (A) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Existing Revolving Borrowings, and (B) the product of (1) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments) multiplied by (2) the aggregate amount of the Resulting Revolving Borrowings, (v) after the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made new Revolving Borrowings (the 
Resulting Revolving Borrowings
) in an aggregate amount for each Borrower equal to the aggregate amount of its Existing Revolving Borrowings and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.03 (and the Company or such Borrower shall deliver such Borrowing Request), (vi) each Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Resulting Revolving Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments) and (vii) each Borrower shall pay each Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on its Loans comprising the Existing Revolving Borrowings. The deemed payments of the Existing Revolving Borrowings made pursuant to clause (i) above shall be subject to compensation by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the date of the effectiveness of such Incremental Commitments occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.
(f) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of any notice from the Company referred to in Section 2.05(a) and of the
31
effectiveness of any Incremental Commitments, in each case advising the Lenders of the details thereof and of the Applicable Percentages of the Lenders after giving effect thereto and of the assignments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.05(e).
SECTION 2.06.
    
Letters of Credit.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for herein, from time to time during the Availability Period, a Borrower may request any Issuing Lender to issue, and such Issuing Lender shall issue (unless the Required Lenders shall have asserted that the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 with respect to such issuance are not satisfied), Letters of Credit denominated in dollars for the account of such Borrower. Each Letter of Credit shall be in such form as shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Lender in its reasonable determination.  The aggregate LC Exposure shall constitute a utilization of the Commitments.
(b) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), a Borrower shall deliver by hand or facsimile (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the relevant Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit) to such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, that such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in dollars, the name of the account party (which shall be a Borrower or a Subsidiary and a Borrower as co-applicants), the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  It is understood that the reinstatement of all or a portion of a Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms thereof following a drawing thereunder shall not constitute an amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit. If requested by such Issuing Lender, such Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Lenders standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by a Borrower to, or entered into by a Borrower with, any Issuing Lender relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(c) A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure would not exceed $500,000,000 and (ii) the sum of the total Credit Exposures would not exceed the Total Commitment.
(d) No Letter of Credit shall have a stated expiry date that is later than the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit, so long as such renewal or extension occurs within three months of such then-current expiration date) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the first anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date;
provided
that (A) any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above and shall be subject to clause (B) in the case of any renewal that would extend the maturity beyond the fifth Business Day prior to the Commitment Termination Date) under customary evergreen provisions and (B) in the case of the issuance, renewal, extension or amendment of any Letter of Credit having a stated expiry date beyond the fifth Business Day prior to the Commitment Termination Date, the Issuing Lender shall have consented to such stated expiry date in writing prior to
32
such issuance, renewal, extension or amendment and the Company shall be required to cash collateralize such Letter of Credit not later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Commitment Termination Date as provided in paragraph (k) below (but without any requirement for prior notice from the Administrative Agent) and in the event the Company shall fail to post such cash collateral for any Letter of Credit on or prior to such fifth Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall provide notice to the Lenders of such failure to post cash collateral and of each Lenders Applicable Percentage of such amount and each Lender shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to make a Loan to the Company on the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which such notice is delivered in the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the amount of cash collateral required to be so posted, the proceeds of which will be applied by the Administrative Agent to cash collateralize such Letter of Credit as provided in paragraph (k).
(e) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by any Issuing Lender, and effective as of the occurrence of the Effective Date with respect to each Existing Letter of Credit issued by any Issuing Lender, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit or the Lenders, such Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of a notice as provided for in the final paragraph of Section 2.06(f), to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender of each Letter of Credit such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the amount of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Lender promptly upon the request of such Issuing Lender at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the relevant Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason.  Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the relevant Borrower pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Lender as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the relevant Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f) If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the relevant Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time (or, in the case of an LC Disbursement that is being funded with an ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan, 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on (i) the Business Day that the relevant Borrower receives notice that such LC Disbursement has been made, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the relevant Borrower
33
receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time;
provided
that the relevant Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or Section 2.04 that such payment be financed with all or any portion of an ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan, as applicable, in an amount permitted under Section 2.02(c) and, to the extent so financed, the relevant Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan (or the applicable portion thereof). Each such payment shall be made to the relevant Issuing Lender in dollars and in immediately available funds.
If any Borrower fails to make payment when due in respect of any LC Disbursement relating to a Letter of Credit issued for its account, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof.
(g) Each Borrowers obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.06(f) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged or fraudulent or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders as security for any of such reimbursement obligations failing to be perfected, (v) the occurrence of any Default, (vi) the existence of any proceedings of the type described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII with respect to any other Loan Party, (vii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of such reimbursement obligations against any other Loan Party, or (viii) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of any Borrower hereunder.
None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by any Issuing Lender thereof or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Lender from liability to any Borrower or to any Lender which has funded its participation hereunder in such Letter of Credit to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Loan Parties and the Lenders to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Borrower or any such Lender, as the case may be, that are caused by such Issuing Lenders failure to exercise the standard of care agreed hereunder to be applicable when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that such standard of care shall be as follows, and that such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised such standard of care in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment):
(i) an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make
34
payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
(ii) an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(h) Upon presentation of documents with respect to a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit, each Issuing Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit shall (i) promptly notify the Administrative Agent, the Company and (if different) the relevant Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such demand for payment, (ii) promptly following its receipt of such documents, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit and (iii) promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent, the Company and (if different) the relevant Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) whether the Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement under such Letter of Credit;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving any such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(f).
(i) If any Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the relevant Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to, but excluding, the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans;
provided
that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.06(f), then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.06(d) to reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(j) An Issuing Lender may be added, or an existing Issuing Lender may be terminated, under this Agreement at any time by written agreement between the Company, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such addition or termination.  At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the Issuing Lender being terminated.  From and after the effective date of any such addition, the new Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter.  References herein to the term Issuing Lender shall be deemed to refer to each new Issuing Lender or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such new Issuing Lender and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the termination of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the terminated Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not be required to issue any new Letters of Credit or to renew or extend any such outstanding Letters of Credit.
(k) If either (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph or (ii) paragraph (d) above or any of the other provision of this Agreement requires cash collateralization of any LC Exposure, the Company shall deposit within one Business Day after notice from the Administrative Agent of the requirement thereof into an account established and maintained on the books and records of the Administrative Agent, which account may be a securities account (within the meaning of Section 8-501
35
of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York), in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties (the 
LC Collateral Account
), an amount in immediately available funds in Dollars equal to 105% of the LC Exposure (or, in the case of any cash collateralization required pursuant to paragraph (d) above, 105% of the LC Exposure required to be cash collateralized) as of such date
plus
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such amount shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposits shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the LC Exposure under this Agreement and for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, and for this purpose the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the LC Collateral Account, the LC Collateral Account shall be subject to an account control agreement satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in its Permitted Discretion and each Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties in the LC Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the UCC) or other property held therein. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent (in accordance with its usual and customary practices for investments of this type) and at the Borrowers risk and reasonable expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the LC Collateral Account. Moneys and financial assets in the LC Collateral Account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Guaranteed Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall cause all such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) to be returned to the Company within three Business Days after (A) in the case of clause (i) above, the applicable Event of Default shall have been cured or waived (so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time) or (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, to the extent such cash collateral shall no longer be required pursuant to the applicable provision hereof.
(l) Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender shall (i) provide to the Administrative Agent copies of any notice received from any Borrower pursuant to Section 2.06(b) no later than the Business Day after receipt thereof and (ii) report in writing to the Administrative Agent (A) on the first Business Day of each week, the activity for each day during the immediately preceding week in respect of Letters of Credit issued by it, including all issuances, extensions, amendments and renewals, all expirations and cancellations and all disbursements and reimbursements, (B) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, whether such Letter of Credit is a trade, financial or performance Letter of Credit, the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amount thereof changed), and whether any Letter of Credit so issued provides for automatic reinstatements of the face amount thereof following any drawing thereunder , and no Issuing Lender shall be permitted to issue, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension is then permitted by the terms of this Agreement, (C) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender makes any LC Disbursement, the date of such LC Disbursement and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (D) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request, including but not limited to prompt verification of such information as may be requested by the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.07.
    
Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, or, in the case of an ABR Loan, 2:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders,
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower promptly, and in no event later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Company in the applicable Borrowing Request.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption and in its sole discretion, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrowers agree (jointly and severally with each other Borrower, but severally and not jointly with the applicable Lenders) to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Loan. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount (less interest) shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. With respect to any share of a Borrowing not made available by a Lender as contemplated above, if such Lender subsequently pays its share of such Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly repay any corresponding amount paid by the relevant Borrower to the Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph (including interest thereon to the extent received by the Administrative Agent);
provided
that such repayment to such Borrower shall not operate as a waiver or any abandonment of any rights or remedies of such Borrower with respect to such Lender.
SECTION 2.08.
    
Interest Elections.
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or designated by Section 2.03 and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request or designated by Section 2.03. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company was requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile or by other electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request substantially in the form of
Exhibit E
signed by the Company (on behalf of itself or the applicable Borrower) or the applicable Borrower.
37
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.03:
(i) the name of the applicable Borrower and the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period and permitted under Section 2.02(d).
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Company or the Subsidiary Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Revolving Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.09.
    
Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, all Commitments shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.
(b) The Company, on behalf of the Borrowers, may at any time terminate, without premium or penalty (other than, with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, payments that may become due under Section 2.16), the Commitments upon (i) the payment in full of all outstanding Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, (ii) the payment in full of the accrued and unpaid fees and (iii) the payment in full of all reimbursable expenses and other Obligations together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company, on behalf of the Borrowers, may from time to time reduce, without premium or penalty (other than, with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, payments that may become due under Section 2.16), the Commitments,
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the aggregate Credit Exposures would exceed the Total Commitment. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of
38
the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under this paragraph at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this paragraph shall be irrevocable,
provided
that a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of other Indebtedness or any other event, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
SECTION 2.10.
    
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) The Borrowers hereby unconditionally promise to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Commitment Termination Date, and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Commitment Termination Date and the date that is the seventh day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) after such Swingline Loan is made,
provided
that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made by the Company or any Subsidiary Borrower, the Company or such Subsidiary Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the date such Borrowing was requested.
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof, (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of any Issuing Lender and (v) the application or disbursement by the Administrative Agent of any amounts pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein,
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans and pay interest thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e) Any Lender may request that Revolving Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note, substantially in the form of
Exhibit H
, payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
39
SECTION 2.11.
    
Prepayment of Loans.
(a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay without premium or penalty (other than, with respect to Eurocurrency Borrowings, payments that may become due under Section 2.16) any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.
(b) In the event and on each occasion that the aggregate Credit Exposures of the Lenders exceed the Total Commitment, the Borrowers shall prepay Revolving Borrowings and/or Swingline Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;
provided
that if the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Borrowings and Swingline Borrowings then outstanding is less than the amount of such excess (because LC Exposure constitutes a portion thereof), the Borrowers shall deposit an amount in cash equal to such excess in the LC Collateral Account. If the Borrowers are required to provide (and have provided the required amount of) cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) and such excess is subsequently reduced, cash collateral in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) any such reduction and (y) the amount of such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in Section 2.06(k)) shall be returned to the Borrowers within two Business Days after such reduction.
(c) Prior to any optional prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the applicable Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and the Company shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section.
(d) The Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by facsimile or by other electronic transmission) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, set forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment,
provided
that a notice of optional prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of other Indebtedness or any other event, in which case such notice of prepayment may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified date) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans) the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Revolving Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13(d).
SECTION 2.12.
    
Fees.
(a) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the relevant Facility Fee Rate specified in the definition of Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the Commitment Termination Date;
provided
that, if such Lender continues to have any Credit Exposure after the Commitment Termination Date, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lenders Credit Exposure from and including the Commitment Termination Date to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year and on the
40
Commitment Termination Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that any facility fees accruing after the Commitment Termination Date shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(b) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans on the average daily amount of such Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the Commitment Termination Date and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure.
(c) The relevant Borrower with respect to each Letter of Credit agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender of such Letter of Credit (i) a fronting fee, which shall accrue at a rate per annum separately agreed by the Company and such Issuing Lender, on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to such Letter of Credit (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to but excluding the date on which there ceases to be any such LC Exposure under such Letter of Credit and (ii) such Issuing Lenders standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.
(d) Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of each calendar quarter shall be payable on the third Business Day of the calendar month following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the Commitment Termination Date and any such fees accruing after the Commitment Termination Date shall be payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to any Issuing Lender pursuant to paragraph (c) above shall be payable at the times separately agreed upon between the Company or the relevant Borrower and such Issuing Lender or otherwise within 10 days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(e) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon in writing between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
(f) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of commitment fees, in accordance with this Section 2.12. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
SECTION 2.13.
    
Interest.
(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by a Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% per annum
plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
41
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% per annum
plus
the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments,
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the Commitment Termination Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.14.
    
Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing:
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their respective Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone (promptly confirmed in writing) or facsimile or by other electronic transmission as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Revolving Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be converted to, or continued as, an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing,
provided
that following the first day that such condition shall cease to exist, such Borrowings may be made as or converted to Eurocurrency Borrowings at the request of and in accordance with the elections of the applicable Borrower.
SECTION 2.15.
    
Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate) or any Issuing Lender;
42
(ii) subject any Lender or Issuing Lender to any Taxes on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Excluded Taxes and (C) Other Connection Taxes on gross or net income, profits or revenue (including value-added or similar Taxes)); or
(iii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost, or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue ay Letter of Credit) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has had or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or Issuing Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or Issuing Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender or Issuing Lender, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lenders or Issuing Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Lender setting forth in reasonable detail an explanation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or their respective holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders right to demand such compensation,
provided
that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
43
SECTION 2.16.
    
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan (or to convert any ABR Loan into a Eurocurrency Loan) on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(d) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company to replace a Lender pursuant to Section 2.19(b) or Section 9.02(c), then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and reasonable expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurocurrency Rate (without consideration of the Applicable Rate) that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market (without consideration of the Applicable Rate). A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after the Companys receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17.
    
Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes, provided that if any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent (as defined below)) requires the deduction or withholding of any Indemnified Tax from any such payment (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such deduction or withholding required to be made by the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, or, in the case of any Lender that is treated as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, by such Lender for the account of any of its direct or indirect beneficial owners), the applicable Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, the Lender or the applicable direct or indirect beneficial owner of a Lender (any such person a Withholding Agent) shall make such deductions and timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions for Indemnified Taxes (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender, any Issuing Lender or its beneficial owner, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.
(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.17(a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) To the extent not paid, reimbursed or compensated pursuant to Section 2.17(a) or (b), the Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender and Issuing Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lender (or its beneficial owner) or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties under any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
44
amounts payable under this Section) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority (except for any interest, penalties, or expenses determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the Loan Parties to a Governmental Authority pursuant to Section 2.17(a), the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any applicable withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine that such Lender is not subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, in the case of any withholding tax other than the U.S. Federal withholding Tax, the completion, execution and submission of such forms (other than such documentation set forth in clauses (i) through (v) of this paragraph (f) below) shall not be required if in the Foreign Lenders judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Foreign Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense (or, in the case of a Change in Law, any incremental material unreimbursed cost or expense) or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Foreign Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
45
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a U.S. Borrower, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the U.S. is a party,
(ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the Form of
Exhibit K
to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (D) the interest payments in question are not effectively connected with the United States trade or business conducted by such Lender (a 
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
) and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN,
(iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical participation), an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided
that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more beneficial owners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of such beneficial owners, or
(v) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification previously delivered by such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Lender shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such Lenders legal inability to do so.
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such
46
payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f), the term FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g) Each Fee Receiver hereby represents that it is a Permitted Fee Receiver
and agrees to update Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or its successor form) or the applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or its successor form) upon any change in such Fee Receivers circumstances or if such form expires or becomes inaccurate or obsolete, and to promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent if such Fee Receiver becomes legally ineligible to provide such form.
(h) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid by any Borrower pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Indemnified Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
, that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will any Issuing Lender or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Borrower the payment of which would place the Issuing Lender or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Issuing Lender or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This clause shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
(i) Each partys obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, termination of the Loan Documents and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations thereunder.
(j) For purposes of Section 2.17(d) and (f), the term Lender includes any Issuing Lender.
SECTION 2.18.
    
Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a)
The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or fees or reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 9.03, or otherwise) at or prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under any other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York or at such other address that the Administrative Agent shall advise the Company in writing, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
47
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under any Loan Document shall be made in dollars.
(b) Prior to any repayment of any Borrowings hereunder (other than the repayment in full of all outstanding Borrowings on the scheduled date of such repayment), the Borrowers shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such selection at the times and on the days provided in Section 2.11(d);
provided
that each repayment of Borrowings shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings before any other Borrowings.  If a Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid (in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence) or prepaid (in accordance with Section 2.11), such payment shall be applied, first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings and, second, to other Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first).  Each repayment or prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing.
(c) Any proceeds of Collateral or any other amounts received by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement or another Loan Document (i) not constituting (A) a specific payment of principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrowers), (B) a mandatory prepayment under Section 2.11(which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.11), or (C) amounts to be used to cash collateralize LC Exposures, or (ii) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders so direct, shall be applied ratably to the Guaranteed Obligations as follows:
first
, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Loan Party and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document,
second
, to the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Guaranteed Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Guaranteed Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution),
third
, to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, and
fourth
, to the Loan Parties, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Company or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall apply any payment that it receives to a Eurocurrency Loan, except (x) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurocurrency Loan or (y) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR Loans and, in any such event, the Borrowers shall pay any break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.16. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(d) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:  (i) each Revolving Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of commitment fees under Section 2.12(a) shall be made for the accounts of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the Commitments under Section 2.09 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Revolving Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders
48
according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Revolving Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Revolving Loans by a Borrower shall be made for the account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Revolving Loans made to such Borrower and held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans by a Borrower shall be made for the accounts of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to them.
(e) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)
first
, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)
second
, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(f) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans,
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or any LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(g) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company or the relevant Borrower, prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender or an Issuing Lender hereunder, that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
49
(h) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or (d), 2.06(e) or (f), 2.07(b), 2.17(d), 2.18(g) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lenders (or, following the payment of all amounts then due to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lenders, to the extent the Lenders shall have funded payments to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Lender in respect of other such amounts, for the benefit of the other Lenders) to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19.
    
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Lenders), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling such Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20.
    
Additional Subsidiary Borrowers.
The Company may, at any time and from time to time, designate a Domestic Subsidiary that is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (or, with the prior written consent of each Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), that is a Subsidiary of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, more than 80% of the voting Equity Interests), as a Subsidiary Borrower, in each case by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrower Joinder Agreement executed by such Domestic Subsidiary and by the Company, and upon such delivery such Domestic Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement. Any Subsidiary Borrower shall continue to be a Subsidiary Borrower until the
50
Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrower Termination Agreement with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower, whereupon such Subsidiary Borrower shall cease to be a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (a) no Borrower Joinder Agreement shall become effective as to any such Domestic Subsidiary if it shall be unlawful for such Domestic Subsidiary to become a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder or for any Lender to make Loans or otherwise extend credit to such Domestic Subsidiary as provided herein and (b) no Borrower Termination Agreement shall become effective as to any Subsidiary Borrower until all Loans made to and all amounts payable by such Subsidiary Borrower in respect of LC Disbursements, interest and/or fees (and, to the extent notified by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any other amounts payable under any Loan Document by such Subsidiary Borrower) shall have been paid in full,
provided
that such Borrower Termination Agreement shall be effective to terminate the right of such Subsidiary Borrower to request or receive further extensions of credit under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrower Joinder Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.
SECTION 2.21.
    
Defaulting Lenders.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (with each express reference to the term 
Applicable Percentage
 meaning, with respect to any Lender for purposes of this Section 2.21, the percentage of the Total Commitment disregarding any Defaulting Lenders Commitment represented by such Lenders Commitment):
(a) the facility fees set forth in Section 2.12(a) shall cease to accrue on the portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender that is in excess of its Credit Exposure;
(b) the Commitment and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02),
provided
that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders, or which is referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.02(b), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender;
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(k) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if any Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to this paragraph (c), the Borrowers shall not be required to pay
51
any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this paragraph (c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation; and
(v) if any Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this paragraph (c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lenders or any Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Lenders until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and
(d) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the applicable Borrower in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 2.21, and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with paragraph (c)(i) of this Section (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposures and LC Exposures of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans (other than Swingline Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
ARTICLE III
Representations and Warranties
Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:
SECTION 3.01.
    
Organization; Powers.
Each Loan Party is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each Loan Document to which it is a party and to effect the Transactions, and is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure to so qualify, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.02.
    
Authorization; Enforceability.
The Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party and the execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and, if required, action by the holders
52
of such Loan Partys Equity Interests. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Borrower or such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
SECTION 3.03.
    
Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.
The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) filings with any Governmental Authority necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents following the Collateral Trigger Date and (ii) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any material Requirement of Law applicable to any Borrower or any Subsidiary to the extent failure to comply with which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) will not violate the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of any Borrower or any Subsidiary, (d) will not violate or result in a material default under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon any Borrower or any Subsidiary or their respective assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any material payment to be made by any Borrower or any Subsidiary or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any material obligation thereunder and (e) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than a Lien permitted under Section 6.02) on any asset of the Company or any Subsidiary.
SECTION 3.04.
    
Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.
(a) The Company has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 (and comparable period for the prior fiscal year). Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes and consolidated statements of stockholders equity in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.
(b) Since October 1, 2011, there has not occurred any event, change or condition that has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.
(c) The fair value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (both at fair valuation and at present fair saleable value) is greater than the total amount of liabilities (including contingent and unliquidated liabilities) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries are able to pay all their liabilities as such liabilities mature and do not have unreasonably small capital with which to carry on their business. In computing the amount of contingent or unliquidated liabilities at any time, such liabilities will be computed at the amount which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.
SECTION 3.05.
    
Properties.
(a) Each Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all the real and personal property that is material to its business, free of all Liens other than Liens permitted by Section 6.02.
(b) Each Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and
53
the use thereof by the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries does not infringe in any material respect upon the rights of any other Person.

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to any Borrower described in paragraph (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Loan Parties, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Loan Parties accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Loan Parties; and in case of any event with respect to any Borrower described in paragraph (h) or (i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Loan Parties accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Loan Parties. Upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, exercise any rights and remedies provided to the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the UCC.
ARTICLE VIII
The Administrative Agent
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as third party beneficiaries of any of such provisions.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Loan Parties or any Subsidiary of a Loan Party or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
74
contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary or believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Loan Party that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02 or believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be necessary) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, genuineness or accuracy of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of Liens on the Collateral or the existence of the Collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any representation, notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts, other than to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction determines by final and nonappealable judgment liability to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time upon notice to the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent
75
of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in the absence of a continuing Event of Default, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Company and the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent that shall be a commercial bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such commercial bank, in either case acceptable to the Company in the absence of a continuing Event of Default (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, obligations and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its subagents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) neither the Arrangers nor any Person named on the cover page of this Agreement as a Syndication Agent or a Documentation Agent shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender or an Issuing Lender), but all such Persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder, and (ii) each Loan Party agrees not to make, and hereby waives, any claims based on any alleged fiduciary duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or any of the Arrangers.

SECTION 9.02.
    
Waivers; Amendments.
(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice to or demand on the Company or any Loan Party in any case shall entitle the Company or any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b) None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than the default rate of interest set forth in Section 2.13(c) on such Loans or LC Disbursements), or reduce or forgive any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce or forgive the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change the order of payments specified in Section 2.18(c) or change Section 2.18(e) or (f) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Commitments), or (vi) permit any Loan Party to assign its rights hereunder, release any Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement (except as expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement or this Agreement) or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee, or release all or substantially all the Collateral that has been pledged to secure the Guaranteed Obligations from the Liens of the Loan Documents, without the written consent of each Lender;
provided
further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent may also amend the
Commitment Schedule
to reflect assignments entered into pursuant to Section 9.04.
(c) In connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or termination (a
78
Proposed Change
) requiring the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender, if the consent of Lenders having Credit Exposures and unused Commitments representing at least 66% of the sum of the total Credit Exposure and unused Commitments at such time shall be obtained (calculated after excluding the Credit Exposures and Commitments of any Defaulting Lenders), but the consent to such Proposed Change of other Lenders whose consent is required shall not be obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but has not been obtained being referred to as a 
Non-Consenting Lender
), then, the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to any such Non-Consenting Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Non-Consenting Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee acceptable to the Company that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent to such assignment of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) after giving effect to such assignment (and any simultaneous assignments by other Non-Consenting Lenders), sufficient consents shall have been obtained to effect such Proposed Change, (iii) such Non-Consenting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Loan Parties (in the case of all other amounts) and (iv) the Loan Parties or such assignee shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 9.04(b).
SECTION 9.03.
    
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a) The Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable outofpocket expenses (including expenses incurred in connection with due diligence) incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel selected by the Administrative Agent and of such special and local counsel as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in its good faith discretion, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions of the Loan Documents (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable outof-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by any Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable out-ofpocket expenses incurred during any workout or restructuring (and related negotiations) in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit, and (iv) at any time after the Collateral Trigger Date, all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent associated with collateral monitoring and collateral reviews (including reasonable fees and expenses of advisors and professionals engaged by the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers relating thereto).
(b) The Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lender and each Lender and their affiliates and the respective Related Parties of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an 
Indemnitee
) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee (
provided
that in connection therewith the Borrowers shall only be responsible for the fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel selected by the Administrative Agent and of such special
79
and local counsel as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in its good faith discretion, except that if any indemnified person concludes that its interests conflict with those of other indemnified persons, the Borrowers shall also be responsible for the fees, charges and disbursements of separate counsel for such indemnified person), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Company or any Subsidiary arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Lender to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on, at, to or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by the Company or any Subsidiary, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Company or any Subsidiary and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto,
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee. This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
(c) To the extent that the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and without limiting the Borrowers obligation to do so, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount,
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. The obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph (c) are subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(a) (which shall apply
mutatis
mutandis
to the Lenders obligations under this paragraph (c)).
(d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no Loan Party shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof;
provided
that nothing in this clause (i) shall limit the indemnification obligations of the Borrowers under this Section 9.03 in respect of special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages awarded against an Indemnitee, and (ii) no Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through electronic, telecommunications or other information transmission systems unless such damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than three Business Days after written demand therefor setting forth the basis for such claim in reasonable detail.
SECTION 9.04.
    
Successors and Assigns.
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit) except that
80
(i) neither the Company nor any of the other Borrowers may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Company or any other Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in clause (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than the Borrower, its affiliates, any natural person or any Defaulting Lender) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of: (A) the Company,
provided
that no consent of the Company shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee (it being agreed that, following such assignment, the Company shall be promptly notified thereof by the Administrative Agent); and
provided
further
that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received written notice thereof; (B) the Administrative Agent,
provided
that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; (C) each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender (each consent required under this sentence not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Person that is a Fee Receiver but not a Permitted Fee Receiver shall not be an assignee without the written consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent (whether or not an Event of Default has occurred) (which consent may be withheld in the Companys and the Administrative Agents sole discretion).
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the trade date specified in the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment or, if no date is so specified, as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent shall otherwise consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
provided
that no such consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500,
provided
that assignments made pursuant to Section 2.19(b) shall not require the signature of the assigning Lender to become effective; and (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Tax forms required by Section 2.17(f) and an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Loan Parties and their Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees
81
compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to clause (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03) and to any fees payable hereunder that have accrued for such Lenders account but have not yet been paid. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and, as to entries pertaining to it, each Issuing Bank and Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire and any Tax forms required by Section 2.17(f) (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this clause.
(vi) The words execution, signed, signature and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or any Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any Person that would be a Fee Receiver but not a Permitted Fee Receiver, unless such Fee Receiver receives written consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent (which consent may be withheld in the Companys and the Administrative Agents sole discretion)) (such Person, a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders
82
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it),
provided
that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) such participation shall not increase the obligations of any Loan Party under any Loan Document, except as contemplated below, and (D) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.
(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 2.17(d) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).
(iii) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents,
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to clauses (c)(iii) and (v) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender,
provided
that such Participant shall be subject to Sections 2.18(f) and 2.19 as though it were a Lender.
(iv) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers and solely for tax purposes, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the 
Participant Register
);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(v) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 9.08 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Companys prior written consent, provided that the Participant shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as
if it were an assignee under clause (b).
(vi) Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (a) has purchased a participation in the minimum amount of $7,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent (
Voting Participant Notification
), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a 
Voting Participant
) and (c)
83
receives the prior written consent of the Company (on behalf of itself and the other Borrowers) and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an Assignee as set forth in
Exhibit A
hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation purchased. The Company and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each bank or other lending institution that is a member of the Farm Credit System designated as a Voting Participant in Schedule 9.04(c)(vi) hereto shall be a Voting Participant without delivery of a Voting Participant Notification and without the prior written consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.
(d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Company or the Administrative Agent, pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, a central bank of any OECD nation or the Farm Credit Funding Corp. or to any other entity organized under the Farm Credit Act, as amended, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest,
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION 9.05.
    
Survival.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Company and the other Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters or Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

SECTION 9.08.
    
Right of Setoff.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers against any of and all obligations of the Loan Parties now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligation.

SECTION 9.15.

Maximum Rate
) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

87
all notices, requests, consents, certifications and/or authorizations or other similar acts delivered or taken by the Company for or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant hereto or the other Loan Documents without inquiry and as if such notices, requests, consents, certifications and/or authorizations or other similar acts were delivered by such Borrower. Each representation, warranty, covenant, agreement and undertaking made on behalf of any Borrower by the Company shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such Borrower and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Borrower to the same extent as it if the same had been made directly by such Borrower. The Company (or any successor Company permitted pursuant to this Section 9.16) shall not be permitted to resign as the Company and the Borrowers shall not be permitted to remove the Company (or any successor Company permitted pursuant to this Section 9.16) as Company without the consent of the Administrative Agent,
provided
that if the Company notifies the Administrative Agent in writing that it (or any successor Company permitted pursuant to this Section 9.16) shall no longer be able to act as Company in accordance with the terms hereof, the Loan Parties shall appoint a successor to act as Company, which successor shall be a Borrower acceptable to the Administrative Agent (and the Borrowers hereby agree that such Person thereafter shall be vested with all rights, powers, privileges and authority of the Company hereunder).

APPENDIX A
Collateral Trigger Date Provisions

 means, collectively, the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, any control agreements entered into pursuant to Section 5.13 and any other documents granting a Lien upon any Collateral as security for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or perfecting any such Lien.

 has the meaning assigned to such term in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.
Deposit Account Control Agreement
 has the meaning assigned to such term in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.
Guarantee and Collateral Requirement
 means the requirement that:
(a)     the Administrative Agent shall have received from the Company and each other Collateral Party either (i) a counterpart of the Guarantee
and Collateral
Agreement, duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person or (ii) a supplement to the Guarantee
and Collateral
Agreement, in the form specified therein, under which such Collateral Party shall become a party to such agreement, duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person, together with documents and opinions of the type referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.01 with respect to such Collateral Party;
(b)     all documents and instruments, including Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, required by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to be filed, registered or recorded to create the Liens intended to be created by the Loan Documents and to perfect such Liens to the extent required by, and with the priority required by, such documents, shall have been filed, registered or recorded or delivered to the Administrative Agent for filing, registration or recording; and
(c)     each Loan Party shall have obtained all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it in connection with the execution and delivery of all Loan Documents to which it is a party, the performance of its obligations thereunder and the granting by it of the Liens thereunder.
The foregoing definition shall not require the creation or perfection of security interests in, or the obtaining of legal opinions or other deliverables with respect to, particular assets of the Loan Parties, or the provision of Guarantees by any Subsidiary, if and for so long as the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the
C
ompany, determines that the cost of creating or perfecting such security interests in such assets, or obtaining such legal opinions or other deliverables in respect of such assets, or providing such Guarantees (taking into account any adverse tax consequences to the Company and the Subsidiaries), shall be excessive in view of the benefits that would be obtained by the Lenders therefrom. The Administrative Agent may grant extensions of time for the creation and perfection of security interests in or the obtaining of legal opinions or other deliverables with respect to particular assets or the provision of any Guarantee by any Subsidiary (including extensions beyond the 15th Business Day after the Collateral Trigger Date or in connection with assets acquired, or Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Collateral Trigger Date) where it determines that such action cannot be accomplished without
undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required to be accomplished by this Agreement or the Loan Documents.
Securities Account Control Agreement
 means, individually and collectively, each Securities Account Control Agreement referred to in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.
SECTION 3.17.
Security Interest in Collateral.
The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents create legal and valid Liens on all the Collateral in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties, and, for so long as UCC financing statements or deposit account control agreements, as the case may be, with respect to such Collateral have not been terminated by the Administrative Agent (or otherwise amended by the Administrative Agent in a manner that adversely affects the Lien in favor of the Guaranteed Parties thereby perfected), such Liens constitute perfected and continuing Liens on the Collateral, securing the Guaranteed Obligations, enforceable against the applicable Loan Party and all third parties, and having priority over all other Liens on the Collateral except in the case of Liens permitted under clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 6.02, to the extent any such Liens would have priority over the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to any applicable law.
SECTION 5.09.
Insurance.
(b) Within 15 Business Days after the Collateral Trigger Date (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may agree in its Permitted Discretion), and at all times thereafter, the Company shall cause all insurance policies required under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.09, to the extent such insurance policies by their terms insure any portion of the Collateral, to name the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties) as a loss payee, and to contain loss payable clauses, through endorsements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that provide that (i) all proceeds thereunder with respect to any Collateral shall be payable to the Administrative Agent, as its interests may appear, or the Company, but shall in any event be promptly deposited into the Collection Account and (ii) such policy and loss payable clauses may be canceled or terminated only upon at least 10 days prior written notice given to the Administrative Agent. It is agreed that insurance proceeds in respect of assets constituting Collateral will, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be available to the Company to finance the repair or replacement of such assets.
(c) If the Company or any Subsidiary shall fail to obtain any insurance as required by paragraph (a) of this Section 5.09, the Administrative Agent, following notice to the Company, may obtain such insurance at the Companys expense. By purchasing such insurance, the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have waived any Default arising from the Companys or such Subsidiarys failure to maintain such insurance.
SECTION 5.12.
Casualty and Condemnation
. The Company (a) will furnish to the Administrative Agent (for delivery to the Lenders) prompt written notice of any casualty or other insured damage to any portion of the Collateral or the commencement of any action or proceeding for the taking of any portion of the Collateral or interest therein under power of eminent domain or by condemnation or similar proceeding, in any of the foregoing cases to the extent the value of the Collateral affected thereby exceeds $[25,000,000], and (b) will ensure that the net proceeds of any such event (whether in the form of insurance proceeds, condemnation awards or otherwise) are collected and applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Collateral Documents.
SECTION 5.13.
Control Agreements.
(a) Prior to the day that is 60 days after the Collateral Trigger Date (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may agree in its Permitted Discretion) each Borrower will, and the Company will cause each applicable Collateral Party to, (i)
maintain the Deposit Account Control Agreements required to be provided pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and (ii) maintain the Collection Account with the Administrative Agent.
(b) Prior to the day that is 60 days after the Collateral Trigger Date (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may agree in its Permitted Discretion) and quarterly thereafter the Company shall determine the aggregate balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of all Loan Parties in accounts (other than (i) each deposit account, the funds in which are used, in the ordinary course of business, solely for the payment of salaries and wages, workers compensation, pension benefits and similar expenses, (ii) each deposit account used, in the ordinary course of business, solely for daily accounts payable and that has an ending daily balance of zero and (iii) each deposit account or securities account all the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities contained in which are subject to a Lien permitted under Section 6.02(a)(xii)) not subject to Deposit Account Control Agreements or Securities Account Control Agreements in favor of the Administrative Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, on such day or on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter, as the case may be, and if such aggregate balance shall at any time of determination exceed $25,000,000, the Company shall promptly eliminate such excess from such accounts or shall within 30 days enter, or cause the applicable Loan Parties to enter, into one or more Deposit Account Control Agreements or Securities Account Control Agreements in favor of the Administrative Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent so that there shall not thereafter be any such excess.
(c) The Company shall ensure that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of the Company, taken together with all other Collateral owned directly by the Company, shall not at any time exceed the lesser of (i) $250,000,000 and (ii) the maximum amount of Tyson Indenture Restricted Obligations that can, at such time, be secured by Tyson Restricted Collateral without any requirement under Section 4.3 of the Tyson Indenture that the Tyson Notes be ratably secured by such Tyson Restricted Collateral (each capitalized but undefined term in this clause (c) having the meaning assigned thereto in the Guarantee Agreement).
SECTION 5.14.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.06, at any time after the Collateral Trigger Date, but not more than one time in any twelve month period following the Collateral Trigger Date, at the request of the Required Lenders, the Loan Parties will provide the Administrative Agent with appraisals or updates thereof of their Inventory from an appraiser selected and engaged by the Administrative Agent, and prepared on a basis satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, such appraisals and updates to include, without limitation, information required by applicable law and regulations. For purposes of this Section 5.14, it is understood and agreed that a single appraisal may consist of examinations conducted at multiple relevant sites and involve one or more relevant Loan Parties and their assets. All such appraisals shall be commenced upon reasonable notice to the Company and performed during normal business hours of the Company, and all out-of-pocket costs of such appraisals shall be at the sole expense of the Required Lenders.
SECTION 5.15.
Field Examinations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.06, at any time after the Collateral Trigger Date, but not more than one time in any twelve month period following the Collateral Trigger Date, at the request of the Required Lenders, the Loan Parties will permit, upon reasonable notice, the Administrative Agent to conduct a field examination of the Collateral and related reporting and control systems. For purposes of this Section 5.15, it is understood and agreed that a single field examination may be conducted at multiple relevant sites and involve one or more relevant Loan Parties and their assets. All such field examinations shall be commenced upon reasonable notice to the Company and performed during normal business hours of the Company, and all out-of-pocket costs of such field examinations shall be at the sole expense of the Required Lenders.
SECTION 9.18.
Appointment for Perfection.
Each Lender hereby appoints each other Lender as its agent for the purpose of perfecting Liens, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC or any other applicable law, can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender (other than the Administrative Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Administrative Agents request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to the Administrative Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Administrative Agents instructions.
