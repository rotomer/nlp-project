ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS On April 1, 2003, Tesoro Petroleum Corporation ("Tesoro") issued a press release announcing completion of the CARB III project at its California refinery. The foregoing is qualified by reference to the press release which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. On April 2, 2003, Tesoro issued a press release announcing a private offering of $400 million of senior secured notes. The foregoing is qualified by reference to the press release which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Tesoro is also negotiating a new senior secured credit facility and a term loan agreement with terms designed to (1) increase Tesoro's capacity to borrow for working capital needs, (2) allow Tesoro to issue letters of credit instead of making early payments and prepayments to certain suppliers (which have ranged from approximately $80 million to $160 million at month-end for the last nine months) and apply the funds that would otherwise have been used for those payments and prepayments to repay debt and (3) substantially modify the financial covenants Tesoro has under its existing senior secured credit facility. Tesoro previously reported its acquisition of the 168,000 barrel-per-day Golden Eagle refinery located in Martinez, California in the San Francisco Bay area along with 70 associated retail sites throughout northern California (collectively the "California Business") from Ultramar Inc., a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation. A pro forma statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 as if Tesoro had completed the acquisition of the California Business on January 1, 2002 is attached as Appendix A to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The information provided in this Item 9 is being provided under Item 12, and shall specifically be considered "filed" and incorporated into all documents filed by Tesoro pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. ---------- The information presented in this Current Report on Form 8-K may contain forward-looking statements and certain assumptions upon which such forward-looking statements are in part based. Numerous important factors, including those factors identified as Risk Factors in Tesoro's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other of the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the fact that the assumptions set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K could prove incorrect, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements.

APPENDIX A PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS The term "California Assets" refers to the 168,000 barrels per day ("bpd") refinery located in Martinez, California in the San Francisco Bay area along with 70 associated retail sites throughout northern California that we acquired in May 2002. The acquisition of the California Assets and the related debt and equity financings closed during the first and second quarters of 2002 and are included in Tesoro's historical balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations give effect to the following events as if each had occurred on January 1, 2002: -- the acquisition of the California Assets; -- the April 2002 offering of the outstanding 9-5/8% senior subordinated notes due 2012; -- the March 2002 underwritten public offering of 23 million shares of our common stock; and -- additional borrowings under our amended and restated senior secured credit facility necessary to consummate the acquisition of the California Assets. As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, Tesoro's historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 included results of the California Assets for the period from May 17, 2002 (the closing date for the acquisition) through December 31, 2002. The acquisition of the California Assets was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The estimates of the fair value of the California Assets and related liabilities are based on preliminary estimates. These estimates are subject to change pending completion of independent appraisals and other evaluations. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations is based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and is intended for informational purposes only. We believe it is not indicative of the future results of the combined companies or of the results of operations that would have actually occurred had the acquisition of the California Assets taken place for the period presented. A major turnaround at our California refinery, including the refinery's fluid coker, was completed in March 2002, and a turnaround of the larger crude unit was completed in the second quarter of 2002. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations does not reflect any benefits from potential cost savings or revenue enhancements resulting from the integration of the operations of the California Assets.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements of Tesoro Petroleum Corporation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the Financial Statements of Golden Eagle Refining and Marketing Assets Business (the "California Business") included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 25, 2002, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 22, 2002.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [TESORO LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: INVESTORS: JOHN ROBERTSON, DIRECTOR, INVESTOR RELATIONS, (210) 283-2687 MEDIA: TARA FORD, DIRECTOR, PUBLIC RELATIONS & EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS, (210) 283-2676 TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION INCREASES CARB PRODUCTION AT GOLDEN EAGLE REFINERY SAN ANTONIO_ April 1, 2003 _ Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today announced the completion and start-up of a major project at its Golden Eagle refinery. With these enhancements, the refinery will be able to increase the production of California Air Resources Board (CARB) gasoline that complies with the new phase III standards which go into effect in California on January 1, 2004 and regulations requiring the phase-out of the use of MTBE by year-end 2003. The CARB III project will increase Golden Eagle's capacity to produce CARB gasoline by up to 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) or approximately 30 percent. Golden Eagle is the only refinery in California that is expected to significantly increase CARB gasoline production during 2003. In addition, during periods of peak gasoline demand, the company plans to move up to 15,000 bpd of CARB/CARBOB gasoline produced from its Anacortes, Washington refinery to California in 2003. Combined, Tesoro will be able to supply Californians with up to 105,000 bpd of CARB/CARBOB gasoline.
Tesoro's CARB III project includes the construction of a new gasoline hydrotreater required to remove sulfur from gasoline produced at the Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) and Fluid Coker to maximize refinery CARB gasoline production. Altogether, the project includes modifications to seven refinery units. Engineering began on the project in mid-year 2001, and construction started in May 2002. Project tie-ins to existing piping and utilities occurred during previously scheduled turnarounds to avoid outages during periods of peak gasoline demand. The project was completed ahead of schedule and within budget. "The start up of the CARB III project was extremely successful," said Bill Haywood, Tesoro's President, California and Southwest Region. "Completion of this project is great news not only for Tesoro but also for the state of California," he said. Located in the San Francisco Bay area, the highly sophisticated, 168,000 bpd, Golden Eagle refinery is the largest and most complex plant within Tesoro's refining system. Over the last two and a half years, approximately $400 million in capital was invested in Golden Eagle to improve its reliability and maximize CARB gasoline production. Tesoro Petroleum Corporation, a Fortune 500 Company, is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products and provider of marine logistics services. Tesoro operates six refineries in the western United States with a combined capacity of nearly 560,000 barrels per day. Tesoro's retail-marketing system includes over 600 branded retail stations, of which over 200 are company operated under the Tesoro(R) and Mirastar(R) brands. This news release contains certain statements that are "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements contain projections as to the expected CARB/CARBOB gasoline production of Tesoro's Golden Eagle and Anacortes, Washington refineries. Factors which may cause actual results to differ from those forward-looking statements include: changes in general economic conditions, worldwide political conditions and war, disruptions due to equipment interruptions or failure at Tesoro-operated or third-party facilities, and other factors beyond Tesoro's control. For more information concerning factors that could cause such differences, see Tesoro's annual report on Form 10-K and other of Tesoro's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesoro undertakes no obligation to publicly
release the result of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or which Tesoro becomes aware of, after the date hereof. ###

Consistent with the company's goal of reducing cash operating expenses this year, the company offered voluntary enhanced retirement benefits to qualified employees during the first quarter.

Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. The company also announced that it made a $60 million term debt payment yesterday including the scheduled repayment of $13 million for the first quarter.
