Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Reports First Quarter Earnings SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 30, 2003--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net income of $20.4 million or $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2003 compared to a net loss of $55.6 million or $1.15 per share for the first quarter of 2002. The first quarter of 2003 results include $8.8 million in pre-tax charges, or $0.08 per share, which are primarily related to the company's early retirement program and severance costs. "Our first quarter operating income of $79.5 million demonstrates the earnings potential of our assets, which last year did not include our California refinery," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "In addition to the benefit of that refinery, the results were better due to stronger industry margins and the continued progress of our operating income initiatives," Smith said. "Compared to the average of the third and fourth quarters of last year, which is our baseline period for measuring improvements, we made good progress toward our $65 million goal. First quarter operating income improved by $15 million, as we reduced costs by $10 million and captured non-capital refining improvements totaling $5 million. A component of these initiatives was a company-wide workforce reduction that included a voluntary early retirement program. Overall, we estimate that our workforce reduction program will realize annual savings of nearly $20 million from the elimination of 214 full-time and contract positions. We also believe that costs in the second quarter will continue to decline and that we will achieve our goal by the end of 2003," added Smith. On April 17 Tesoro completed its previously announced refinancing of its senior secured credit facility. "With this refinancing, we reduced our annual cash interest expense, improved our overall financial flexibility and positioned ourselves to expedite our debt reduction program. It is our belief that these changes will permit us to withstand lower industry margins," said Smith. The company also repaid $76 million in term debt during the quarter. "Our plan has targeted $500 million in debt reduction by the end of 2003. As of March 31 we had $300 million remaining on our goal. With the benefit of the new credit facility and with reasonable margins, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow. Debt reduction is our top financial priority and I am committed to achieving the targeted debt reduction I set last June," added Smith.

This news release contains certain statements that are "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
