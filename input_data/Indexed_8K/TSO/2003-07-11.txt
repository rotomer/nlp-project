Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Continues Debt Repayment SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 8, 2003--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) announced that it reduced total debt by $168 million during the second quarter bringing the total debt reduction since the end of the second quarter of 2002 to $322 million. In addition, the company had over $74 million of cash invested as of June 30, 2003. Total debt, net of cash, at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion compared to $1.9 billion at the end of the first quarter. "I am very pleased with this demonstration of our continued focus on debt reduction," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "As expected, our new credit agreement allowed us to recapture most of the cash which had been invested in support of trade credit. After we closed on the acquisition of the Golden Eagle assets last year, we set a goal of repaying $500 million of debt by the end of 2003. Since that time, we have achieved nearly 75% of the goal while reducing our debt load from a high of almost $2.1 billion and we are committed to continued debt reduction." The company also announced that it has met the excess availability threshold on its revolving credit agreement that will allow Tesoro to take advantage of a 50 basis point reduction on the revolver borrowing spread over LIBOR and letter of credit expense.
