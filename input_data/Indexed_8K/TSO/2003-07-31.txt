Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Reports Second Quarter Results SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--xx--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net income before special items of $14.0 million, or $0.22 per share, for the second quarter of 2003, excluding an after-tax charge of $21.0 million, or $0.33 per share, to write off the unamortized debt issuance costs of the company's previous credit facility. Including the write off, the company reported a net loss during the quarter of $7.0 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to a net loss of $17.9 million, or $0.28 per share, for the second quarter of 2002. For the first half of 2003, the company reported net income before special items of $40.1 million, or $0.62 per share, excluding after-tax charges of $26.7 million, or $0.41 per share, for the write off of the unamortized debt issuance costs of the company's previous credit facility along with charges primarily related to the company's early retirement and severance program costs. Including these charges, the company reported year-to-date net income of $13.4 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to a net loss of $73.5 million, or $1.30 per share, for the first six months of 2002. "Operationally, we are pleased with the results this quarter, given that industry refining margins were below first quarter and mid-cycle levels," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "Although margins were better than the second quarter of 2002, industry refining margins for our operating areas averaged $9.48 per barrel, down $0.79 per barrel from the first quarter's average of $10.27 per barrel and below the five-year average for the second quarter of $10.30 per barrel. The challenges during the quarter included a crude oil market that was highly volatile and a narrowing discount on heavy crude oil causing downward pressure on our refining margin, compared to the margin we experienced during the first quarter." Operating income for the refining segment during the second quarter was $72.3 million compared to $109.2 million during the first quarter of 2003. Total refinery throughput averaged 497,200 barrels per day (bpd) during the second quarter compared to 464,500 bpd during the first quarter of 2003. "Although our overall throughput seasonally increased compared to the first quarter, total throughput was negatively impacted by a turnaround at our Alaska refinery, reduced throughput rates due to unplanned maintenance at our Golden Eagle plant, and reduced rates at our Hawaii refinery due to reduced jet fuel demand," stated Smith. Retail operations increased operating income during the quarter to $10.3 million compared to the first quarter operating loss of $8.1 million. "Our retail segment reported a strong improvement compared to the first quarter as marketing margins across the country showed marked improvement. During the quarter, retail also benefited from a lower cost structure," commented Smith. "During the quarter we repaid $171 million of debt. As of June 30, we had $129 million remaining on our $500 million goal. Debt reduction remains our top financial priority and with reasonable margins, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and reduce our debt," added Smith.

(b) During the three months ended June 30, 2003 the Company wrote-off approximately $33.3 million of unamortized debt issue costs related to voluntary prepayments of debt and the replacement of the Company's previous credit facility with a new credit agreement and term debt.

(c) The assumed conversion of common stock equivalents produced anti- dilutive results for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and the three months and six months ended June 30, 2002 and therefore was not included in the dilutive calculations.
