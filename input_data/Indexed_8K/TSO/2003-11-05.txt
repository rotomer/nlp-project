Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Reports Third Quarter Earnings SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--xx--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net earnings of $70.6 million, or $1.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2003 versus a net loss of $15.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the third quarter of 2002. Results for the third quarter include after-tax charges of $4.7 million, or $0.07 per share, for the loss on the pending sale of the Marine Service assets and $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share for the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to the company prepaying $125 million of debt during the quarter. Excluding these special items, net earnings for the quarter were $77.1 million, or $1.19 per share, compared to a net loss excluding special items for the third quarter of 2002 of $18.8 million, or $0.29 per share. For the first nine months of 2003, Tesoro reported net earnings of $84 million, or $1.30 per share, versus a net loss for the first nine months of 2002 of $89.3 million, or $1.51 per share. Results for the first nine months of 2003 include after-tax charges of $33.2 million, or $0.51 per share, for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the company's previous credit facility and other debt prepayments, charges for the company's early retirement and severance program costs in the first quarter of 2003, along with the loss on the pending sale of the Marine Service assets. Excluding special items, net earnings were $117.2 million, or $1.81 per share, compared to a net loss before special items of $81.9 million, or $1.38 per share, for the first nine months of 2002. "The reliability of our operations enabled us to benefit from the seasonally strong gasoline demand and higher margin environment due to industry supply problems on the West Coast," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "We did not, however, see the full benefit of the improved margin environment in the mid-continent region since our Mandan refinery had a planned maintenance turnaround for almost the entire month of September." As previously announced, the company prepaid the remaining balance of its current asset term loan of approximately $125 million during the quarter. "Although we have made significant strides this year in reducing our overall debt, continued debt reduction remains our top financial priority," stated Smith.

(a) Certain reclassifications were made to prior period amounts to conform to current presentation, principally to reclassify amortization of major maintenance turnaround costs from operating expenses to depreciation and amortization and to net purchases and sales considered to be energy trading contracts. (b) On October 27, 2003, the Company agreed to sell substantially all of the physical assets of Marine Services for approximately $32 million including inventories, which are estimated to be valued at $5 million. The Company recorded a pretax estimated loss of $7.6 million, or $0.07 per share, in September 2003, reflecting the sales value of the assets and estimated selling costs. (c) The Company wrote-off approximately $2.9 million and $36.2 million during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively, of unamortized debt issue costs related to voluntary prepayments of debt and the replacement of the Company's previous credit facility with a new credit agreement and term debt during the 2003 second quarter. The Company also recorded charges of $12.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2002 for financing costs related to the acquisition of the California refinery. (d) The assumed conversion of common stock equivalents produced anti-dilutive results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2002 and therefore was not included in the dilutive calculations.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. (g) Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (h) Gross refining margin is revenues less cost of refining feedstock, which approximates total Refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the Retail segment at prices which approximate market. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2002, certain inventory quantities were reduced, resulting in the liquidation of applicable LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs. This reduction in LIFO inventory resulted in a decrease in cost of sales of approximately $5 million and a decrease in net loss of $3 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2002. (i) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.55 and $0.51 for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $0.58 and $0.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (j) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin included margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
