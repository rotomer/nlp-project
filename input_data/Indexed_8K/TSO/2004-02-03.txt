Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Petroleum Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 3, 2004--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported a net loss of $7.9 million, or $0.12 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to a net loss of $27.7 million, or $0.43 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2002. Excluding special items, the net loss was $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss excluding special items for the fourth quarter of 2002 of $15.5 million, or $0.24 per share. As reported in the attached financial information, results for the quarter included after-tax charges of $6.4 million, or $0.10 per share, which were primarily non-cash charges for the termination of its funded supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) and an impairment write-down on certain retail gas stations. Fourth quarter 2002 results included after-tax charges of $12.2 million, or $0.19 per share, which were charges for a change in income tax rates, an impairment write-down for the sale of certain retail assets, financing costs related to the acquisition of Golden Eagle, along with severance and integration costs. For the full year of 2003, the company reported net earnings of $76.1 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, versus a net loss for the full year of 2002 of $117.0 million, or $1.93 per share. Excluding special items, full year 2003 net earnings were $115.8 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $95.5 million, or $1.58 per share, for the full year of 2002. As reported in the attached financial information, results for the full year 2003 included after-tax charges of $39.7 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, termination of the SERP, charges for early retirement, severance and integration costs and impairment losses on the sale of Marine Services and certain retail stations. Full year 2002 results included net after-tax charges of $21.5 million, or $0.35 per share, for financing costs related to the acquisition of Golden Eagle, changes in the income tax rate, an impairment write-down for the sale of certain retail assets, severance and integration costs and a LIFO inventory benefit. "Low seasonal demand for refined products combined with rapidly rising crude oil prices narrowed margins in all of our refining regions compared to the third quarter of 2003," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "The rise in crude oil prices also negatively impacted margins on certain products, mainly jet fuel, due to contract pricing lags. In addition, we elected to conduct major maintenance work at our Golden Eagle and Anacortes refineries, which further impacted fourth quarter profitability." "In 2003, Tesoro had many notable successes. We strengthened our balance sheet by achieving our $500 million debt reduction goal and we ended the year with $77 million of cash. We negotiated a more flexible, less expensive credit agreement and rationalized our asset base by trimming non-core and under-performing assets. In addition, despite higher utility expenses, we made good progress in right-sizing our cost structure, and we exercised good capital discipline as we rationalized our capital expenditures," stated Smith. "This year, our goal will be to improve the profitability of our operations by achieving greater operating efficiencies, and from the benefit of lower interest expense resulting from our debt reduction. We will also continue to be good capital stewards, without compromising operating safety or reliability. These factors plus our expectation of an improved industry margin environment, should enable us to continue to meet our principal goal of reducing debt," added Smith. Public Invited to Listen to Analyst Conference Call via Internet At 2 p.m., CST, Tuesday, February 3, 2004 Tesoro will broadcast, live, its conference call with analysts regarding fourth quarter and full year 2003 results.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. (f) Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (g) Gross refining margin is revenues less cost of refining feedstock, which approximates total Refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the Retail segment at prices which approximate market. In addition, during the 2002 third quarter, certain inventory quantities were reduced, resulting in the liquidation of applicable LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs. This reduction in LIFO inventory resulted in a decrease in cost of sales of approximately $5 million and a decrease in net loss of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. (h) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.62 and $0.61 for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $0.59 and $0.56 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (i) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin included margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
