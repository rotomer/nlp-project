Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro First Quarter Earnings Rise 150% SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 6, 2004--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported record net earnings of $50.4 million, or $0.75 per share, for the first quarter of 2004 compared to net earnings of $20.4 million, or $0.32 per share, for the first quarter of 2003. "Net earnings were 150% better than last year's first quarter results and the best first quarter results in the history of Tesoro," said Bruce A. Smith, chairman, president and CEO of Tesoro. "Seasonally, product demand is weaker during the first quarter in our markets, but this year, strong demand in combination with below-average product inventories created better-than-normal industry refining margins in all our refining regions. Given the market environment, we increased total refining throughput to capture the higher margin. Good reliability was a key factor in our success this quarter, even though we had some unscheduled downtime at our California refinery." "Net earnings also benefited from lower interest expense as a result of the debt reduction we achieved last year. Our goal is to continue to improve profitability and use free cash flow to reduce debt. The successful completion of our consent solicitation in March gives us greater flexibility to repay debt," stated Smith.
