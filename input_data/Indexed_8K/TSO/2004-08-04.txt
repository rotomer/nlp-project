EXHIBIT 99.1 Tesoro Reports Second Quarter Earnings SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 4, 2004--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported record net earnings of $213.1 million, or $3.11 per share, for the second quarter of 2004 compared to a net loss of $7.0 million, or $0.11 per share, for the second quarter of 2003. Results for the second quarter of 2003 include an after-tax charge of $21.0 million, or $0.33 per share to write-off the unamortized debt issuance costs of the company's previous credit facility. For the first half of 2004, the company reported net earnings of $263.5 million, or $3.88 per share, compared to net earnings of $13.4 million, or $0.21 per share, for the first six months of 2003. Results for the first half of 2003 include after-tax charges of $26.7 million, or $0.41 per share, to write-off costs related to the company's previous credit facility along with early retirement and severance costs. "During the quarter, below-average product inventories and strong finished product demand pushed industry refining margins to above-average levels. Our ability to capture the margin strength and increase profitability was due to better business execution," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "In fact, our ability to safely and reliably increase our refining throughput rates has been a critical factor in the financial success we have achieved so far in 2004." As previously announced, the company prepaid the remaining $297.5 million balance of its 9% Senior Subordinated Notes, due 2008, on July 1, 2004. Total debt after the July 1st prepayment was approximately $1.3 billion, a reduction of about $800 million from the $2.1 billion in debt after the Golden Eagle acquisition in May of 2002. "We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $423 million resulting in a net debt to net capitalization ratio of 49%. On July 1st we used a portion of that cash to prepay the 9% debt," added Smith. "The fact that we have reduced debt by nearly 40% in slightly more than two years confirms our expectations as we built our refining system. Today, we are even more optimistic about our ability to continue to further optimize the system. The combination of internal initiatives, a strong industry environment and a disciplined focus on capital spending should give shareholders improved value as free cash flow per share continues to improve," stated Smith. Public Invited to Listen to Analyst Conference Call via Internet At 10 a.m., CT, Wednesday, August 4, 2004 Tesoro will broadcast, live, its conference call with analysts regarding second quarter 2004 results. Interested parties may listen to the live conference call over the Internet by logging on to Tesoro's Internet site at http://www.tesoropetroleum.com and clicking on the "What's New" section. Tesoro Petroleum Corporation, a Fortune 500 Company, is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products. Tesoro operates six refineries in the western United States with a combined capacity of nearly 560,000 barrels per day. Tesoro's retail-marketing system includes approximately 550 branded retail stations, of which over 200 are company operated under the Tesoro(R) and Mirastar(R) brands. This news release contains certain statements that are "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements concern the company's expectation of continuing strong industry conditions, capital spending and free cash flow. Factors which can cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements include: changes in general economic conditions, the timing and extent of changes in demand for refined products, availability and cost of crude oil, other feedstocks or refined products, throughput and yield levels, disruptions due to equipment interruptions or failure at our or third-party facilities, political developments and other factors beyond our control. For more information concerning these factors and other factors that could cause such a difference, see our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or which we become aware of, after the date hereof.

(d) The assumed conversion of common stock equivalents produced anti-dilutive results for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and therefore was not included in the dilutive calculations.

An additional $4.3 million of reorganization costs were charged to the operating segments during 2003, including $2.6 million in refining, $1.3 million in retail and $0.4 million in marine services. BALANCE SHEET DATA (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) June 30, December 31, 2004 2003 --------- ------------- Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 423.3 $ 77.2 Total Assets $ 4,298.3 $ 3,661.3 Total Debt (f) $ 1,611.5 $ 1,608.8 Total Stockholders' Equity $ 1,242.0 $ 965.4 Total Debt to Capitalization Ratio 56% 62% Total Debt (f) $ 1,611.5 $ 1,608.8 Less: Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 423.3 $ 77.2 --------- ------------- Net Debt (g) $ 1,188.2 $ 1,531.6 Total Stockholders' Equity $ 1,242.0 $ 965.4 --------- ------------- Net Capitalization (g) $ 2,430.2 $ 2,497.0 Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio (g) 49% 61% (f) On July 1, 2004 Tesoro voluntarily prepaid the remaining $297.5 million outstanding principal amount of its 9% senior subordinated notes at a call premium of 3%. (g) Net debt represents total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents the total of net debt and total stockholders' equity. The Company believes net debt to net capitalization is useful in measuring financial leverage at June 30, 2004 because a significant portion of cash at the end of the quarter was used to prepay the 9% senior subordinated notes as discussed in note (f) above. Net debt to net capitalization should not be considered as an alternative to debt to capitalization or any measure of financial leverage presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Net debt to net capitalization may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (j) Gross refining margin is revenues less cost of refining feedstock, which approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (k) Includes $2.6 million for voluntary early retirement benefits and severance payments during the six months ended June 30, 2003.
