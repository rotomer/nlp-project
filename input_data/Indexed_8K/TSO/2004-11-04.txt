Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Reports Third Quarter Earnings SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 4, 2004--Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net earnings of $64.6 million, or $0.93 per share, for the third quarter of 2004 compared to net earnings of $70.6 million, or $1.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2003. As reported in the attached financial information, results for the third quarter include after-tax charges of $12.7 million, or $0.18 per share, to write-off premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the Company's prepayment of almost $400 million of debt during the quarter. Excluding these special items, net earnings for the quarter were $77.3 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to net earnings excluding special items for the third quarter of 2003 of $77.1 million, or $1.19 per share. For the first nine months of 2004, the company reported net earnings of $328.1 million, or $4.79 per share, compared to net earnings of $84 million, or $1.30 per share, for the first nine months of 2003. Excluding special items, net earnings for the nine months of 2004 were $342 million, or $4.99 per share, compared to net earnings excluding special items of $117.2 million, or $1.81 per share, for the first nine months of 2003. "This was another very successful quarter for our company. Industry margins continued to be better than historical averages and exceeded margins in the third quarter of 2003, operational reliability was excellent and our total throughput was our second best ever," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "Throughput and the quarter's financial results could have meaningfully been better without the planned coker turnaround at Golden Eagle. Tesoro began the coker turnaround on September 6th which limited our total throughput at that facility and also reduced the amount of lower cost heavy crude that we could process. In addition, to sustain gasoline production, we purchased higher-cost, lighter crudes and processed more intermediate feedstocks. Using our actual margins, we estimate that we lost the opportunity to generate another $34 million of operating income due to this turnaround." Tesoro stated that the Golden Eagle coker turnaround was completed October 31st and the facility is currently operating at its planned throughput rate of approximately 160,000 barrels per day. "Our third quarter financial results were also impacted by the decision to prepay debt," Smith continued. "In June of 2002, we announced a plan to reduce our debt by $500 million. Including the $400 million of debt we repaid in the third quarter, debt is down nearly $900 million, debt to total capitalization has decreased to 48% and cash at September 30th was over $200 million." "Our commitment to shareholders to grow the value of Tesoro is being recognized by investors and I believe our track record over the past two and a half years confirms our ability to improve future shareholder value," added Smith. Public Invited to Listen to Analyst Conference Call via Internet At 2 p.m., CT, Thursday, November 4, 2004, Tesoro will broadcast, live, its conference call with analysts regarding third quarter 2004 results.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (f) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased products, transportation, and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughout times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (g) Includes $2.6 million for voluntary early retirement benefits and severance payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2003. (h) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.61 and $0.55 for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $0.65 and $0.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (i) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
