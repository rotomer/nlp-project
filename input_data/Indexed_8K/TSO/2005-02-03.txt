Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Corporation Reports Breakeven Fourth Quarter SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 3, 2005--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported a net loss of $200 thousand, or $0.00 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to a net loss of $7.9 million, or $0.12 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2003. "Turnarounds and unanticipated factors, combined with dramatically lower fuel oil prices in December reduced earnings to breakeven. Despite these difficulties, the Company earned a record $328 million in 2004, more than four times 2003 earnings," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO. "As we forecasted last quarter, Golden Eagle's operating income was reduced by an estimated $65 million during the fourth quarter by the coker turnaround and a boiler inspection that idled the cat cracker. Fuel oil inventory increased as a result of the coker turnaround and we also built light product inventory to prepare for first quarter turnarounds at Anacortes and Golden Eagle. With the steep drop in crude and light product prices and a wider discount on fuel oil versus the cost of crude, we had a negative inventory change of $24 million," said Mr. Smith. "Additionally, the quarter was also impacted by several events. In November, we had an unplanned outage of the Anacortes cat cracker which reduced operating income by an estimated $2 million. During the last two weeks of December, our margins fell precipitously due to several factors. Heavy rains on the West Coast reduced product demand which significantly lowered margins as we were selling product at meaningful discounts to posted prices. In the Pacific Northwest, our refining margin was negatively impacted by the increased pricing of Canadian crude relative to Alaska North Slope crude, due to production problems in Canada late in the quarter. Finally, on December 16th, we experienced an unplanned power outage in Hawaii which caused lingering operational inefficiencies during the remainder of the month, further limiting our ability to fully capture industry margins. Nevertheless, our financial results improved compared to the 2003 fourth quarter," explained Mr. Smith. The fourth quarter also included non-cash after-tax charges of $10.6 million, or $0.15 per share, which includes an after-tax charge of $5.0 million representing future premiums related to energy industry mutual insurance consortiums, of which Tesoro is a member, as well as an after-tax charge of $5.6 million primarily related to equipment replaced during a turnaround at one of the Company's refineries. Fourth quarter 2003 results included after-tax charges of $6.4 million, or $0.10 per share, which were primarily non-cash charges for the termination of its funded executive security plan and an impairment write-down on certain retail gas stations. For the full year of 2004, the company reported net earnings of $327.9 million, or $4.76 per share, versus net earnings for the full year of 2003 of $76.1 million, or $1.17 per share. Excluding special items, full year 2004 net earnings were $342.8 million, or $4.97 per share, compared to net earnings of $115.8 million, or $1.78 per share, for the full year of 2003. Results for the full year 2004 included after-tax charges of $14.9 million, or $0.21 per share, primarily for the write-off of premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Company's prepayment of debt along with executive retirement costs. Full year 2003 results included after-tax charges of $39.7 million, or $0.61 per share, for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, termination of the funded executive security plan, charges for early retirement, severance and integration costs and impairment losses on the sale of our marine services operations and certain retail stations. "Corporate and unallocated costs for the quarter, as compared to the 2004 third quarter, increased to $37.0 million due primarily to consulting and contract labor expenses for projects related to driving business excellence. Our business improvement projects are winding down and, therefore, our corporate and unallocated costs will trend down during the first half of 2005," commented Mr. Smith. "Turnarounds caused us to have a difficult fourth quarter but, overall, 2004 was a very good year. Segment operating income for the year increased to $838.3 million compared to $433.1 million for 2003. During 2004, we pre-paid nearly $400 million in debt while increasing our cash balance by over $100 million, driving our debt to capitalization ratio to 48%. As a result, we start 2005 with our strongest balance sheet in over three years with an expectation for a continued good margin environment, a focus on capturing low-capital, self-help initiatives and a drive to define new internal projects to give us added crude flexibility," said Mr. Smith. Public Invited to Listen to Analyst Conference Call via Internet At 12:30 p.m., CT, Thursday, February 3, 2005 Tesoro will broadcast, live, its conference call with analysts regarding fourth quarter and full year 2004 results.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (f) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of refining feedstocks, purchased products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (g) Includes $2.6 million for voluntary early retirement benefits and severance payments during 2003. (h) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.71 and $0.62 for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $0.61 and $0.59 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (i) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
