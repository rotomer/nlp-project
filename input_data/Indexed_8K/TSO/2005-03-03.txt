Exhibit 10.1

Whereas
     , in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto do hereby agree:
Now, Therefore
     1. . The Company hereby agrees to employ Consultant as a consultant, and Consultant agrees to serve the Company in such capacity on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall renew automatically on a month-to-month basis, unless terminated earlier by thirty (30) days written notice or "for cause" as provided in Section 5(c). In the event of the renewal of this Agreement, all of the other terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, except as may be specifically modified by the mutual written agreement of the parties.

Fee
 
month-to-month basis, the Company shall pay for such excess hours on a month-by-month basis. All fees shall be payable in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Company as of the date hereof.
     (b) . After March 1, 2006, and on or before March 30, 2006, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, in his reasonable discretion, shall evaluate the Consultant's performance hereunder and shall determine a bonus in an amount ranging from $0 to two times the total Consulting Fee paid or payable to Consultant during the initial 12 month term of this Agreement for the Consultant's services hereunder. Such bonus shall be paid to the Consultant within five days of its determination.
Bonus
