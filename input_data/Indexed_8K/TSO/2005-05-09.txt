Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Announces First Quarter Results, Initiates Cash Dividend on Common Stock SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 9, 2005--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net earnings of $27.7 million, or $0.40 per share, for the first quarter of 2005 compared to net earnings of $50.4 million, or $0.75 per share, for the first quarter of 2004. As reported in the attached financial information, results for the quarter include an after-tax charge of $6.3 million, or $0.09 per share for expenses related to previously announced termination and retirement of certain executive officers. Excluding these special items, net earnings were $34.0 million, or $0.49 per share. "Overall, our refining margins during the quarter were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter signaling continued strength in market fundamentals. Our plan has been to take needed turnarounds in preparation for another strong summer gasoline season," said Bruce Smith, Chairman, President and CEO at Tesoro. "During the first quarter we completed significant planned turnarounds at Golden Eagle and Anacortes that precluded us from capturing the full benefit of strong first quarter industry spreads. Tesoro estimates that first quarter 2005 operating income was reduced by $75 million as a result of planned turnaround activity, unplanned boiler repairs on two separate units at Golden Eagle, and an unplanned outage of the naphtha hydrotreater and reformer at Anacortes." In total, since September 2004, operating income has been impacted by approximately $175 million due to major turnaround activity at Tesoro's two largest refineries as well as some unplanned system downtime. "Our turnaround plan was to position our system to take advantage of the normally higher margin environment that begins in March. In fact, our plan is working as March and April operating income has been excellent," Smith added. Overall refining operating expenses during the quarter rose due to higher utility, maintenance and employee costs as well as increased allocation of administrative expenses, which included information technology expenses for the first time. Retail operating income was negatively impacted by rapidly rising spot prices which narrowed margins, and by the continued rationalization of stations in non-core areas which negatively impacted volume. In addition to executive termination and retirement expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the quarter as Tesoro continues to invest in infrastructure improvement opportunities. "Administrative expenses during the quarter were higher than we expect to see in subsequent quarters as we extended our employment of outside consultants to help us implement system and process improvements designed to lead to savings in the future," Smith said. "Interest expense will be further reduced in subsequent quarters following the April 18 prepayment of the remaining $96 million principal balance of the Senior Secured Term Loans due 2008," Smith commented. The company will record a pre-tax charge in the second quarter totaling approximately $3 million related to the prepayment, including the 1% premium and a non-cash write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs. At today's interest rates, annual savings amount to approximately $8 million. "Since the acquisition of the Golden Eagle refinery nearly three years ago, we have reduced our total debt by nearly $1.0 billion and have reduced the ratio of net debt to net capitalization from 68% to 45%," Smith noted. Tesoro Initiates Cash Dividend on Common Stock "For the past several years, we have created substantial value for our shareholders by using our strong cash flow to repay debt. While debt reduction is still important, this option is no longer the sole method of creating future shareholder value. In light of our prospects for continued strong cash flows, Tesoro's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share payable on June 15, 2005, to shareholders of record on June 1, 2005," Smith announced. "Tesoro's Board believes that the institution of a regular quarterly dividend is an important component in creating a balanced approach to using free cash flow to create shareholder value. A dividend is one of the means to achieve this goal and we have also developed plans for reinvesting some of that cash in strategic capital projects." Board Approves Incremental Capital Spending Tesoro announced that its Board of Directors had approved an incremental $55 million capital spending program in 2005 designed to capture strategic opportunities in the areas of crude flexibility, yield improvements and cost reduction, as well as an additional regulatory project. The Company also continues to look at other ways of returning or reinvesting cash to create shareholder value. An overview of the plans will be discussed at an analyst conference scheduled for May 11th. That conference will be webcast via Tesoro's website at http://www.tsocorp.com. "With significant turnaround activities at our largest refineries behind us, a much improved balance sheet, strong free cash flow, and clear opportunities to strategically reinvest free cash flows, we have put our shareholders in a position to benefit from what appears to be a very bright future," Smith concluded. Public Invited to Listen to Analyst Conference Call via Internet At 2 p.m., CDT, Monday, May 9, 2005 Tesoro will broadcast, live, its conference call with analysts regarding first quarter 2005 results. Interested parties may listen to the live conference call over the Internet by logging on to Tesoro's Internet site at http://www.tsocorp.com.

BALANCE SHEET DATA (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) March 31, December 31, June 30, 2005 2004 2002 --------- ------------ -------- Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 89.1 $ 184.8 $ 43.0 Total Assets $ 4,391.7 $ 4,075.1 $3,961.8 Total Debt (e) $ 1,227.4 $ 1,218.3 $2,060.4 Total Stockholders' Equity $ 1,389.4 $ 1,327.1 $ 931.1 Total Debt to Capitalization Ratio 47% 48% 69% Total Debt (e) $ 1,227.4 $ 1,218.3 $2,060.4 Less: Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 89.1 $ 184.8 $ 43.0 --------- ------------ -------- Net Debt (f) $ 1,138.3 $ 1,033.5 $2,017.4 Total Stockholders' Equity $ 1,389.4 $ 1,327.1 $ 931.1 --------- ------------ -------- Net Capitalization (f) $ 2,527.7 $ 2,360.6 $2,948.5 Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio (f) 45% 44% 68% - --------------------------- (e) On April 18, 2005, the Company voluntarily prepaid the remaining $96 million outstanding principal balance of our senior secured term loans at a prepayment premium of 1%. (f) Net debt represents total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents the total of net debt and total stockholders' equity. The Company believes net debt to net capitalization is useful in measuring financial leverage at March 31, 2005 because cash at the end of the quarter was used to prepay the senior secured term loans as discussed in note (e) above. Net debt to net capitalization should not be considered as an alternative to debt to capitalization or any measure of financial leverage presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Net debt to net capitalization may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has presented net debt to net capitalization as of June 30, 2002 to reflect debt reduction since the acquisition of the California refinery in May 2002.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (h) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of refining feedstocks, purchased products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (i) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.73 and $0.60 for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (j) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
