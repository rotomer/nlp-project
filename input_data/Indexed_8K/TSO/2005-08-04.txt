Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Reports Second Quarter Earnings, Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 4, 2005--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net earnings of $183.9 million, or $2.62 per share, for the second quarter of 2005 compared to net earnings of $213.1 million, or $3.11 per share, for the second quarter of 2004. As previously disclosed, results for the second quarter of 2005 include an after-tax charge of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share to write-off unamortized debt issuance costs and the prepayment premium associated with the retirement of the company's $96.0 million Senior Secured Term Loans. Excluding this special item, net earnings were $185.7 million, or $2.65 per share. For the first half of 2005, the company reported net earnings of $211.6 million, or $3.02 per share, compared to net earnings of $263.5 million, or $3.88 per share, for the first six months of 2004. Results for the first half of 2005 include after-tax charges of $8.1 million, or $0.12 per share, for the charges associated with prepayment of debt as well as expenses related to the termination and retirement of certain executive officers. This compares to after-tax charges of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per share, for debt financing costs incurred in the first half of 2004. Excluding special items, net earnings for the first half of 2005 were $219.7 million, or $3.14 per share compared with $264.7 million, or $3.90 per share for the first six months of 2004. "Our refining system achieved record throughput rates during the quarter, even with the Hawaii turnaround," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "Increased utilization rates, continued margin strength, and progress in achieving our stated objectives around earnings initiatives contributed to our solid results for the quarter. Increases in operating and administrative expenses, however, reduced operating income year-over-year." Overall refinery operating expenses were higher year-over-year mainly due to increased utility rates and throughput volumes, higher maintenance expenses and employee costs, and allocation of information technology expenses. "Over the last twelve months, we have completed major turnaround work at our Golden Eagle, Anacortes, and Hawaii refineries allowing us to achieve new milestones in production. Not only did we run at a record 541,000 barrels per day during the quarter but we set a monthly throughput record of 564,000 barrels per day in June. We were well positioned in the second quarter to capture historically strong margins and we continue to run well and capture today's strong margins. That's allowing us to generate significant free cash flow, which should make 2005 another banner year for Tesoro," Smith added. Quarterly Common Stock Dividend Declared Tesoro also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on September 15, 2005 to shareholders of record on September 1, 2005.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (g) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of refining feedstocks, purchased products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (h) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.66 and $0.57 for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $0.70 and $0.59 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (i) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
