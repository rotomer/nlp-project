     Holders who properly tender and deliver their consents to the proposed amendments by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 14, unless extended (the "Consent Date"), will be eligible to receive the total consideration with respect to the applicable series of Notes, which includes a consent payment equal to $30 per $1,000 principal amount of the tendered notes.
     In the case of the 9 5/8% Notes due 2012 and the 8% Notes, the total consideration will be determined using standard market practice of pricing to the earliest redemption date, in the case of the 9 5/8% Notes due 2012, at a fixed spread of 50 basis points over the bid side yield on the 3 3/4% Treasury Notes due March 31, 2007, and, in the case of the 8% Notes, 50 basis points over the bid side yield on the 1 1/2% Treasury Notes due March 31, 2006. The prices will be determined at 2:00 p.m. New York City time on the Consent Date based on the Treasury yields reported by the Bloomberg Government Pricing Monitor.

     The total consideration for the 9 5/8% Notes due 2008 is $1,052.06 per $1,000 in principal amount of tendered notes.
     Holders who properly tender after the Consent Date but on or prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) will be eligible to receive the tender offer consideration applicable to such series of notes, which equals the applicable total consideration less the consent payment.
     In addition, all Notes accepted for payment will be entitled to receipt of accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the relevant previous interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.
     The tender offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on November 29, 2005, unless extended (the "Expiration Date"). Settlement for all Notes tendered on or prior to the Consent Date and accepted for payment is expected to be promptly following the satisfaction of the Financing Condition (as defined below). Settlement for all Notes tendered after the Consent Date but by the Expiration Date is expected to be promptly following the Expiration Date. Consummation of the tender offers, and payment for the tendered notes, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including obtaining debt financing, in an amount and on terms acceptable to Tesoro, sufficient to pay, together with a limited amount of cash on hand, for all Notes tendered (the "Financing Condition").
     Holders may withdraw their tenders and revoke their consents at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the Consent Date but not thereafter.
