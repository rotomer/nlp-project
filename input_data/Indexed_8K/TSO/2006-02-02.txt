Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Corporation Reports Record 2005 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results, Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 2, 2006--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported record 2005 fourth quarter net earnings of $69 million, or $0.97 per share compared to breakeven results for the fourth quarter of 2004. Results for the 2005 fourth quarter included special after-tax charges of $57 million, or $0.81 per share, for tender and call premiums and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the company's refinancing of almost $1 billion of debt. Excluding these special items, fourth quarter earnings were $126 million, or $1.78 per share. Fourth quarter results also included other after-tax charges of $18 million, or $0.25 per share, which included a charge of $7 million related to obsolete refining assets and a $3 million impairment charge for certain retail assets. Also included is an $8 million charge for the accelerated depreciation primarily relating to the modification of the fluid coker unit at the company's Golden Eagle refinery. As previously announced, the existing fluid coker is being modified to a delayed coker with significant operational and environmental benefits. For the full year of 2005, the company reported record net earnings of $507 million, or $7.20 per share, versus net earnings for the full year of 2004 of $328 million, or $4.76 per share. Excluding special items, full year 2005 net earnings were $571 million, or $8.11 per share, compared to net earnings of $343 million, or $4.97 per share, for the full year of 2004. Results for the full year of 2005 included special after-tax charges of $64 million, or $0.91 per share, for tender and call premiums and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Company's debt refinancing and prepayments along with expenses related to the termination and retirement of certain executive officers. Full year 2004 results included after-tax charges of $15 million, or $0.21 per share, primarily for debt prepayment and financing costs along with executive retirement expenses. "We continued to run our assets very well during the quarter and achieved record fourth quarter throughput rates of 541,000 barrels per day, allowing us to capture strong margins and post record fourth quarter results," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. The absence of any major turnaround activity during the quarter also contributed to the record run rates, when compared to last year's quarter. Improved marketing margins further contributed to record results. "The past year marked a major turning point for Tesoro," said Smith. "We further optimized our business model, made significant organizational changes including centralizing our decision-making process and strengthened the talent and expertise of our management team. With record annual throughput of 530,000 barrels per day, strong margins, and significant free cash flow, we initiated and then doubled a quarterly dividend, announced a $200 million stock buyback program, reduced debt by nearly $200 million, and refinanced the majority of our remaining high-coupon, secured debt with lower-coupon, unsecured debt." The refinancing and delevering will contribute over $40 million annually to future cash flows and pre-tax earnings. "As we look ahead to 2006, we continue to remain focused on safe, reliable, environmentally sound operations and executing our high-return capital reinvestment program. Industry fundamentals appear poised to deliver another year of strong refining margins and we expect to continue to be able to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders," Smith concluded. Board Declares Quarterly Dividend Tesoro announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2006 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2006.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (f) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of refining feedstocks, purchased products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (g) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.95 and $0.71 for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $0.75 and $0.61 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (h) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
