     Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) announced today that it expects to earn approximately $0.60 per share for the first quarter of 2006. Principal among several items that negatively impacted results was the rapid rise of crude oil prices on the NYMEX during the last 10 days of the quarter. The over $6 per barrel increase impacted the Company's hedge position on approximately 2.5 million barrels of long-haul crude oil and long-term blendstock supplies.
