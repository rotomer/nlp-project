Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Corporation Announces First Quarter Results SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 4, 2006--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net earnings of $43 million, or $0.61 per share for the first quarter of 2006 up 54% from net earnings of $28 million, or $0.40 per share for the first quarter of 2005. Results for the first quarter 2006 included after-tax charges of $4 million, or $0.06 per share, primarily relating to the previously announced sale of 13 retail sites in western Washington. "Tesoro's first quarter earnings improvement was a significant achievement considering weaker market conditions, higher energy costs, the substantial turnaround work at our Golden Eagle refinery and the slow-down at our Alaska refinery due to extreme icing in the Cook Inlet," said CEO Bruce Smith. "During January and February's low margin environment, we completed the ultra low sulfur diesel project at Golden Eagle and additional maintenance that enabled us to optimize throughput and yields in March when margins improved." The company's increase in net earnings during the 2006 first quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher throughput levels, lower interest expense as a result of debt reduction and refinancing in 2005, and decreased corporate general and administrative expenses. "By focusing on operational excellence, Tesoro continues to demonstrate operational success and reliability. One example of the focus on excellence was our employees' rapid response to the mid-February incident in Alaska. This demonstrates the respect we have for the environment and our focus on safe operations," Smith said. "Reliability is a key to profitability and we are focused on maximizing our production to supply our customers during the driving season." Board Declares Quarterly Dividend Tesoro announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable June 15, 2006 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2006.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (c) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of refining feedstocks, purchased products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (d) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.11 and $0.73 for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (e) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes.
