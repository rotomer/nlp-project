Exhibit 99.1 Solid Operational Performance and Optimization of Assets Drives Tesoro Corporation's Record Earnings SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 3, 2006--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net earnings of $326 million, or $4.66 per share, for the second quarter of 2006 compared to net earnings of $184 million, or $2.62 per share, for the second quarter of 2005. "The second quarter demonstrates the tangible contributions driven by an effective organizational structure and talented people. Our operations are managed by employees who are focused on safety, crude flexibility, reliability and cost control and delivering positive results to our shareholders," said Bruce A. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of Tesoro. "The optimal mix of crude sources, product markets, production and logistics management led to our record results. Refining margins in the western United States were robust this quarter, highlighting the market fundamentals of tight gasoline supplies and greater national demand for high octane gasoline blending components. We expect these fundamentals to continue to drive a strong margin environment, especially on the West Coast," said Smith. For the first half of 2006, the company reported net earnings of $369 million, or $5.25 per share, compared to $212 million, or $3.02 per share, for the first six months of 2005. Refining operating income for the second quarter was over 50% higher or $212 million more than 2005 with significant gains from the Northwest and California regions driven by record second quarter throughput and high clean product yields. Benchmark crack spreads in both regions were nearly $10 per barrel ahead of the same period last year. Capital spending for the quarter was $114 million including $20 million for turnarounds. For the year, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $630 million, including turnarounds. In accordance with our third quarter announcement of the cancellation of the Anacortes refinery coker project, the company expects to record in the third quarter a pre-tax charge between $15 and $25 million for the termination of that project. "The margin environment in the second quarter was very, very strong and we expect the fundamentals to continue to be good for the remainder of the year. The key to our performance will be to continue to have each and every employee focus on safety and operational excellence. That will enable us to run our refineries at the optimal level and capture these strong margins," said Smith. Board Declares Quarterly Dividend Tesoro announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable September 15, 2006 to shareholders of record as of September 1, 2006.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (d) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of refining feedstocks, purchased products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (e) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.01 and $0.66 for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $1.06 and $0.70 for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (f) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes. Total product sales were reduced by approximately 23 Mbpd and 21 Mbpd in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, as a result of recording certain purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis beginning in the 2006 first quarter upon adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty."

During the 2005 second quarter, the Company experienced reduced throughput at the Hawaii refinery due to a scheduled maintenance turnaround. In the 2005 first quarter the Company experienced reduced throughput at the California and Washington refineries, primarily as a result of scheduled major maintenance turnarounds and unscheduled downtime.
