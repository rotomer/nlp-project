Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Corporation Announces Record Third Quarter Earnings and Throughput SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2006--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported third quarter net income of $274 million, or $3.92 per share, as compared to $226 million, or $3.20 per share, for the third quarter of last year. Results for the third quarter include an after-tax charge of $17 million, or $0.24 per share, related to the termination of the Anacortes coker project. Excluding this charge, earnings for the quarter were $4.16 per share. For the first nine months of 2006, net income was $643 million, or $9.17 per share, compared to net income of $438 million, or $6.23 per share, for the nine months ending September 30, 2005. The company set a new throughput record this quarter of 574,000 barrels per day which was 15,000 barrels a day greater than the previous record. The company's refineries in California, Alaska, Washington and North Dakota each achieved record throughput for an individual quarter. "Over the past 12 months, five of our six refineries have recorded quarterly record throughput rates. This is just one of many improvements that have contributed to our strong financial performance and allowed us to surpass in the third quarter many of our 2005 annual records," said Bruce A. Smith, Tesoro's Chairman, President and CEO. Operating income for the first nine months of 2006 was $1.1 billion, surpassing the company's 2005 full year operating income. Operating income for the quarter was up 14% or over $50 million versus the third quarter of 2005, despite West Coast crack spreads that were down 15%. This improvement reflects higher reliability and better optimization of the company's assets through sourcing crude oils with the best refining value and moving the products into the right markets. In addition, gross profit margins and capture rates were higher due to a more stable margin environment. As compared to the hurricane-driven volatility of last year's third quarter, the relative stability this year resulted in higher wholesale market spreads and better realizations of the benchmark crack spread. Capital spending for the first nine months of 2006 was approximately $345 million, of which $59 million was for turnaround expenditures. For the year, the company anticipates capital spending of between $550 and $575 million. The company expects capital spending for 2007 to be between $550 and $650 million including turnarounds. The Golden Eagle coker modification project is now expected to cost between $475 and $525 million and the startup has been deferred to early 2008. Higher raw material costs and limited engineering and construction resources continue to pressure project costs. In addition, the company purchased roughly 815,000 shares of its common stock for $51 million during the quarter. Year to date through the third quarter, the company has purchased 2.1 million shares for $135 million. Looking at the immediate quarter, two factors will impact profitability - normal seasonal demand shifts and the Anacortes turnaround. While the seasonal demand shift is expected to be typical, the fundamental outlook remains bullish for product demand in 2007. Gasoline inventories on the West Coast are low relative to the five-year average heading into a busy turnaround season that is expected to extend into the first quarter of next year. In addition, immediate relief for the industry's need to import high octane blending components required to produce West Coast gasoline seems unlikely in the near-term. These factors should provide support for a strong West Coast margin environment in 2007. "Our employees continue to excel in achieving throughput records through safe and reliable performance. Given each and every employee's commitment to operational excellence, along with our belief that historically strong margins will persist, we expect to continue delivering significant value growth for our shareholders," said Smith. Board Declares Quarterly Dividend Tesoro announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable December 15, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2006.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (e) Gross refining margin is revenues less costs of refining feedstocks, purchased products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. Also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (f) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $0.97 and $0.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $1.03 and $0.68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (g) Sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries, products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties. Total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes. Total product sales were reduced by 33 Mbpd and 25 Mbpd in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006 , respectively, as a result of recording certain purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis beginning in the 2006 first quarter upon adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty."
