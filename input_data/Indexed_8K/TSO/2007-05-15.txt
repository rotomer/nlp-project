Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 11, 2007, Tesoro Corporation (the "Company" or "Tesoro") entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase Bank as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement has a five-year term and increases the Company's total available revolving capacity from $750 million to $1.75 billion. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are up to the total available capacity or the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base, consisting of Tesoro's eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories as defined less a standard reserve of $50 million (subject to adjustment if the fixed charge coverage rate is less than 1.0). Borrowings bear interest at either a base rate (8.25% at May 14, 2007) or a eurodollar rate (5.32% at May 14, 2007), plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin at May 14, 2007 was 1.00% in the case of the eurodollar rate, but varies based upon revolver availability and credit ratings. Tesoro is also required to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth. The Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
In connection with the acquisition described in Item 2.01 below, Tesoro entered into a $700 million credit agreement ("Interim Loan Facility") due May 2008 with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions, including Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. as administrative agent. Borrowings bear interest at a eurodollar rate (5.32% at May 14, 2007), plus an applicable margin of 1.25%. The margin increases in increments of 0.25% after 90 days and 135 days from closing and an additional 0.50% after 180 days. The Interim Loan Facility contains covenants and conditions that, among other things, and subject to certain agreed exceptions, limit our ability to pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments. Tesoro is also required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The agreement allows for optional prepayment anytime at par. The Company intends to refinance the Interim Loan Facility with senior unsecured notes. The Interim Loan Facility is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On May 10, 2007, Tesoro acquired from Shell Oil Products US ("Shell") a 100,000 barrel per day ("bpd") refinery and a 42,000 bpd refined products terminal located south of Los Angeles, California along with 278 Shell-branded retail stations located throughout Southern California (collectively, the "Los Angeles Assets"). The purchase price of the Los Angeles Assets was $1.76 billion, including petroleum inventories of $213 million (subject to post-closing adjustments). The Company financed the purchase, including fees approximating $33 million, with $589 million in cash, $500 million on the Credit Agreement and the $700 million Interim Loan Facility. The audited financial statements of the Los Angeles Assets and related unaudited pro forma financial information will be filed at a later date as an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K as required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K. A press release announcing the completion of the acquisition is filed as exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Payments of Interest.
     2.14.1 . With respect to all Advances, interest shall be payable as follows.

Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest on Eurodollar Advances, LC Fees and all other fees hereunder shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest on Floating Rate Advances shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment (unless payment is on the same date as the Advance) on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 12:00 p.m. (Chicago time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance, any fees or any other amounts payable to the Agent or any Lender hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest, fees and commissions in connection with such payment.

Limitation on Interest
 
and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section 2.14.2, even if such provision declares that it controls. As used in this Section 2.14.2, the term "interest" includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits, or other compensation which constitute interest under applicable law, that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the use, forbearance, or detention of money and not as interest and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged, or received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread, in equal parts during the full term of the Secured Obligations. In no event shall the Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or any Holder of Secured Obligations have any right or privilege to reserve, receive, or retain, (i) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of nonusurious interest permitted under the laws of the State of New York or the applicable laws (if any) of the U.S. or of any other applicable state or (ii) total interest in excess of the amount which such Holder of Secured Obligations could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained, or charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of the Secured Obligations at the Highest Lawful Rate. On each day, if any, that the interest rate (the "") called for under this Agreement or any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence. Thereafter, interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest accrual rate. The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest Lawful Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is being made. None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this Section 2.14.2, or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance, or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. If the term of any Secured Obligation is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Holder of Secured Obligations at any time, including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment, or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to such Holder of Secured Obligations, it shall be credited against the then outstanding principal balance of the Borrower's obligations to such Holder of Secured Obligations, effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.

The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

The following shall be used to calculate the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans during the applicable period when the Borrower's senior long-term secured indebtedness (without giving effect to any credit enhancement) is rated BB+ by S&P or Ba1 by Moody's and the Borrower does not qualify for pricing as set forth in the immediately preceding grid.

     For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the following meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:
     "Level I Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter of the Borrower, average daily Excess Availability for such fiscal quarter was greater than 45% of the average monthly Borrowing Base for such fiscal quarter.
 
     "Level II Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter of the Borrower, (i) the Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status and (ii) average daily Excess Availability for such fiscal quarter was less than or equal to 45% of the average monthly Borrowing Base for such fiscal quarter but greater than 30% of the average monthly Borrowing Base for such fiscal quarter.
     "Level III Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter, (i) the Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status or Level II Status and (ii) average daily Excess Availability for such fiscal quarter was less than or equal to 30% of the average monthly Borrowing Base for such fiscal quarter but greater than 15% of the average monthly Borrowing Base for such fiscal quarter.

     "Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status or Level IV Status.
The Applicable Margin shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing tables based on the Borrower's Status for the applicable fiscal quarter.

Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any of the Guarantors with respect to the Obligations. Each Guarantor understands
Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional
 
50

When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, any Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by any Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of any Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary

Delegation of Duties
          9.3 . Neither any Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.

The Agents may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such Note shall have been transferred in accordance with Section 10.6 and all actions required by such Section in connection with such transfer shall have been taken. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

Reliance by Agents

Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates.

Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders
          9.7 . The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), for, and to save each Agent harmless from and against, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated

provided

Agent in Its Individual Capacity
          9.9 . The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.

If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. The Syndication Agent may, at any time, by notice to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, resign as Syndication Agent hereunder, whereupon the duties, rights, obligations and responsibilities of the Syndication Agent hereunder shall automatically be assumed by, and inure to the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, without any further act by the Syndication Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Lender. After any retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
