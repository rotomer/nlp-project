Report of Independent Auditors
To the Members of Equilon Enterprises LLC
In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related combined statements of income and owner's net investment and cash flows of the Shell Los Angeles Refinery and other associated assets collectively ("the Business") present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Business at December 31, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Equilon Enterprises LLC management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Business has significant transactions and relationships with affiliated entitles.

Acquisitions and expenditures for renewals and betterments, including major refinery maintenance, are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to capital projects are accumulated as "Construction in Progress" until the project is completed. Upon completion such costs are reclassified to property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences when the assets are placed in service.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Business records liabilities equal to the fair value of asset retirement obligations and corresponding additional costs in accordance with relevant accounting standards. The obligations included are those for which there Is a legal obligation as a result of existing or enacted law, statutes, or contracts.
Inventories
Inventories of crude oil and refined projects are valued at the lower of cost or market, reported on a LIFO basis. The year-end inventory values were below their current cost by approximately $107.6 million at the end of 2006.
Environmental and Other Accrued Liabilities
The Business accrues for environmental remediation and other liabilities when it is probable that such liabilities exist, based on past events or known conditions, and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. If the Business can only estimate a range of probable liabilities, the minimum future undiscounted expenditure necessary to satisfy the Business' future obligation is accrued.
In 2006, an agreement was reached to settle environmental obligations associated with the certain retail sites of the Business for $92 million. Based on the agreement, SOPUS received a full release of all related environmental obligations and an indemnity from any further legal or regulatory action.
Concentration of Credit and Other Risks
A significant portion of the Business' receivables are from two unrelated customers who collectively represent 47% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31,2006.
Income Taxes
The Business has not historically accrued income tax expense as the Business was included as part of Shell Petroleum Inc.'s consolidated income tax return, which owns SOPUS. In accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Business does not file a separate U.S. federal income return. Income tax provision represents tax expense that would be incurred if the Business filed a separate stand alone tax return.
Comprehensive Income
SFAS No. 130, requires disclosure of all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to the Business' shareholders. There is no difference between the Business' net income and comprehensive income for all periods presented.

FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty In Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109"-
In July 2006 the FASB issued FIN 48, which is effective for financial years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and recognition for certain tax benefits. The Business will adopt FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007, and does not expect a significant impact on the Business' combined financial statements, however additional disclosures will be required.
Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the tax basis of the Business' assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the financial statements. Significant components of deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 2006, are as follows:

EXHIBIT 99.3
On May 10, 2007, Tesoro Corporation ("Tesoro" or the "Company") acquired from Shell Oil Products US (the "Los Angeles Assets Acquisition") a 100,000 barrel per day ("bpd") refinery and a 42,000 bpd refined products terminal located south of Los Angeles, California along with 278 Shell-branded retail stations located throughout Southern California (collectively, the "Los Angeles Assets").The purchase price for the Los Angeles Assets was $1.76 billion which includes $213 million for estimated inventories, subject to post-closing adjustments. Tesoro financed the Los Angeles Assets Acquisition, including estimated fees and expenses of $28 million, with $584 million in cash and with proceeds from (i) the borrowing of $500 million under our amended and restated credit agreement (the "amended credit agreement") and (ii) the borrowing of $700 million under our 364-day $700 million term loan (the "interim term loan" and collectively, the "Financing Transactions"). The Los Angeles Assets Acquisition and the Financing Transactions are collectively referred to as the "Transactions".
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the Transactions as if each had occurred on March 31, 2007 and the following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations give effect to the Transactions as if each had occurred on January 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements do not include the USA Petroleum acquisition as it is insignificant to the Company's financial position and results of operations. The USA Petroleum acquisition was completed on May 1, 2007 and included 138 USA retail stations located primarily in California. The purchase price of the assets and the USA brand of $273 million was paid in cash, including $7 million for inventories, subject to post-closing adjustments.
The estimates of the fair values of the Los Angeles Assets and related liabilities included in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet are based on preliminary estimates. These estimates with respect to inventories, property, plant and equipment, acquired intangibles and certain assumed liabilities will likely change. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are based on assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable and are intended for informational purposes only. They are not necessarily indicative of the future financial position or the results of operations that would have actually occurred had the Los Angeles Assets Acquisition taken place as of the date or for the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations do not reflect any benefits from potential cost savings or revenue enhancements resulting from the integration of the operations of the Los Angeles Assets Acquisition. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations include allocations of corporate overhead related to the historical Los Angeles Assets financial statements totaling $51 million and $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the three months ended March 31, 2007, respectively. Tesoro believes the actual incremental corporate overhead that we will incur will be less than the allocated amounts.
These unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", the Company's historical consolidated financial statements included in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and the financial statements of the Shell Los Angeles Refinery and Other Associated Assets included as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K/A.
 
 
 
Feedstock and refined product inventories reflect estimated post-closing adjustments. Further post-closing adjustments will be necessary if the actual value of the feedstock and refined products inventories differs from the estimated value above. For purposes of this pro forma analysis, the above estimated purchase price has been allocated based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed as follows (in millions):
