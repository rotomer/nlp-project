Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 29, 2007, Tesoro Corporation (the "Company") issued and sold $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6/% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") to Lehman Brothers Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc. The Company used the proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, to repay borrowings under its $700 million 364-day term loan (the "Term Loan").

The Term Loan was used to finance, in part, the acquisition of certain assets from Shell Oil Products US. The Company entered into the Term Loan due May 2008 with Lehman Brothers Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as joint lead arrangers, JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association as syndication agent, and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. as administrative agent on May 11, 2007. Borrowings bore interest at a eurodollar rate (5.32% at May 14, 2007), plus an applicable margin of 1.25%. Had the Term Loan remained outstanding, the margin would have increased in increments of 0.25% after 90 days and 135 days from closing and an additional 0.50% after 180 days. The Term Loan contained covenants and conditions that, among other things, and subject to certain agreed exceptions, limited the Company's ability to pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments. The Company was also required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Term Loan allowed for optional prepayment anytime at par and was terminated upon repayment on May 29, 2007.
The Notes were issued at an issue price of 100%. Interest on the Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2007. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2017. The Notes are unsecured and are initially jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries.
Prior to June 1, 2012, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a "make whole" redemption price. In addition, prior to June 1, 2010, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings.
The Notes were issued under an Indenture dated as of May 29, 2007, among the Company, certain subsidiary guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Indenture"). The Indenture contains customary restrictive covenants and default provisions for an issue of senior notes of this nature. A copy of the Indenture is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Notes were issued pursuant to a private placement and are expected to be resold by the initial purchasers under Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1934.
Additionally, the Company and certain subsidiary guarantors entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers of the Notes, dated as of May 29, 2007, pursuant to which the Company and the subsidiary guarantors will file an exchange offer registration statement to exchange the Notes for publicly registered notes with identical terms or, under certain circumstances, file a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the Notes. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
The proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the obligations under the Term Loan. In accordance with such repayment, the Term Loan was terminated on May 29, 2007. The information with respect to the Term Loan set forth in Item 1.01 of this report is incorporated into this Item 1.02 by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
As set forth in Item 1.01 of this report, on May 29, 2007 the Company issued $500 million in 6/% Senior Notes due 2017. The information set forth in Item 1.01 of the report with respect to the issuance and the terms of such Notes is incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.

Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value and the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.09.
     In the case an Unrestricted Subsidiary incurs Non-Recourse Indebtedness and any such Non-Recourse Indebtedness ceases to be Non-Recourse Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, then such event shall be deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to this Section 4.09.
     The Company will not incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms; that no Indebtedness of the Company will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company solely by virtue of being unsecured.
provided, however,
     For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 4.09, the Company will, in its sole discretion, classify (or later classify or reclassify) in whole or in part such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Section 4.09 and such item of Indebtedness or a portion thereof may be classified (or later classified or reclassified) in whole or in part as having been incurred under more than one of the applicable clauses or pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 4.09.

Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under any Credit Facility or otherwise expend or invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.

Excess Asset Sale Proceeds
     When the aggregate amount of Excess Asset Sale Proceeds exceeds $30,000,000, the Company will be required to make an offer to the Holders of Notes and the holders of any Senior Indebtedness that is subject to requirements with respect to the application of net proceeds from asset sales that are substantially similar to those contained in this Indenture (an "") to purchase on a pro rata basis (with the Excess Asset Sale Proceeds prorated between the Holders of Notes and such holders of Indebtedness based upon outstanding aggregate principal amounts) the maximum principal amount of the Notes and such other Indebtedness that may be purchased or prepaid, as applicable, out of the prorated Excess Asset Sale Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest), if any, thereon, to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.09 hereof. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Indebtedness tendered (and electing to be redeemed or repaid, as applicable) pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Asset Sale Proceeds, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Asset Sale Proceeds for general corporate purposes and any other purpose not prohibited by this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of the prorated Excess Asset Sale Proceeds, the Company shall select such Notes and such other Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of the offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Asset Sale Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

          (k) to provide for the issuance of Exchange Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees to be issued pursuant to a corresponding Registration Rights Agreement or Additional Notes and related Subsidiary Guarantees in accordance with the terms hereof.
     Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
SECTION 9.02.
With Consent of Holders of Notes.
     Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture (including Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof), the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with the purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes).
     Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate
 
and an Opinion of Counsel, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.
     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
     After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes, or the Subsidiary Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
          (a) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver under any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee;
          (b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter or waive in any manner that adversely affects the rights of any Holder of Notes any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes except as provided above with respect to Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof and the related definitions;
          (c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note;
          (d) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
          (e) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
          (f) make any change that adversely affects the rights of any Holder of Notes in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or make any change to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes (except as permitted in clause (g) of this Section 9.02);
          (g) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof); or
 
          (h) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 hereof or in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
SECTION 9.03.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
     Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a amended or supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
SECTION 9.04.
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
     Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
SECTION 9.05.
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
     The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company, in exchange for all Notes, may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
     Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
SECTION 9.06.
Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc.
     The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article IX if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until the Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
 
SECTION 10.01.
Subsidiary Guarantees.
     Subject to this Article X, each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees on a senior subordinated basis to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes held thereby and the Obligations of the Company hereunder and thereunder, that:
          (a) the principal of, and premium, if any, interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, subject to any applicable grace period, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, upon repurchase or redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, and premium, if any, (to the extent permitted by law) interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, the Notes, and all other payment Obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full and performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
          (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, subject to any applicable grace period, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, upon repurchase or redemption or otherwise.
     Failing payment when so due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. An Event of Default under this Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under the Subsidiary Guarantees, and shall entitle the Holders to accelerate the Obligations of the Guarantors hereunder and under the Notes in the same manner and to the same extent as the Obligations of the Company hereunder and under the Notes. The Guarantors hereby agree that their Obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor, to the extent permitted by law, hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the Obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture or upon the release of such Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to Section 10.4 hereof. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors, or any Note Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by the Company or any Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, the Subsidiary Guarantees, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor agrees
 
that it shall not be entitled to, and hereby waives, any right to exercise any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any Obligations guaranteed hereby, except as provided under Section 10.05 hereof. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI hereof for the purposes of its Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article VI hereof, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for the purpose of its Subsidiary Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor pursuant to Section 10.05 hereof after the Notes and the Obligations hereunder shall have been paid in full to the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantees.
     To effect any additional Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01 hereof, any future Guarantor shall execute and deliver a supplemental indenture substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, which supplemental indenture shall be entered into in accordance with Section 4.16 hereof and shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor, by manual or facsimile signature, by an Officer of such Guarantor.
     To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01 hereof, each Guarantor of a Note hereby agrees that a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form set forth on Exhibit A hereof shall be endorsed by manual or facsimile signature of an Officer of such Guarantor or of the Company as attorney-in fact for such Guarantor on each such Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor, by manual or facsimile signature, by an Officer of such Guarantor. For so long as a Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor remains in full force and effect, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its attorney-in-fact for the purpose of executing in the name and on behalf of such Guarantor any endorsement of a notation of a Subsidiary Guarantee on any Note. If an Officer of the Company whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
     Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each or any Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
     The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
     For so long as a Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor remains in full force and effect, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its attorney-in-fact for the purpose
 
of executing in the name and on behalf of such Guarantor any supplemental indenture to this Indenture, or consent to any such supplemental indenture, which the Company and the Trustee are authorized to enter into pursuant to Sections 9.01 or 9.02 of this Indenture.
SECTION 10.03.
Guarantors May Consolidate, Etc., on Certain Terms.
     (a) Prior to the release of its Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, no Guarantor shall sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into, another Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the resulting, transferee or surviving Person) other than the Company or another Guarantor, unless (i) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists and (ii) either: (A) the Person acquiring the properties or assets in any such sale or other disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company or another Guarantor) unconditionally assumes, pursuant to a supplemental indenture substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, all of the Obligations of such Guarantor under this Indenture, the Notes, its Subsidiary Guarantee and, if in effect, the corresponding Registration Rights Agreement or (B) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with Section 4.10 hereof.
     (b) In the case of any such sale, other disposition, consolidation or merger and upon the assumption by the resulting, transferee or surviving Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, of the Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such resulting, transferee or surviving Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All of the Subsidiary Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
SECTION 10.04.
Releases.
     The Subsidiary Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be released:
          (a) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, if the sale or other disposition complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;
          (b) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, if the sale or other disposition complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;
 
          (c) if such Guarantor is a Restricted Subsidiary and the Company designates such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;
          (d) upon Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture in accordance with Article VIII hereof;
          (e) upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; or
          (f) following the occurrence of an Investment Grade Rating Event, at such time as such Guarantor does not have outstanding or guarantee Indebtedness in excess of a De Minimis Guaranteed Amount.
     Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate to the effect that any of the conditions set forth in clauses (a) through (f) of the immediately preceding paragraph has occurred, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its Obligation under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Indenture. Any Guarantor not released from its Obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of, and premium, if any, interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes and for the other Obligations of such Guarantor under this Indenture as provided in this Article X.
SECTION 10.05.
Limitation on Guarantor Liability; Contribution.
     For purposes hereof, each Guarantor's liability under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the Obligations of the Company under the Notes and this Indenture and (ii) the amount, if any, which would not have (A) rendered such Guarantor "insolvent" (as such term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code and in the Debtor and Creditor Law of the State of New York) or (B) left such Guarantor with unreasonably small capital at the time its Subsidiary Guarantee of the Notes was entered into; , it will be a presumption in any lawsuit or other proceeding in which a Guarantor is a party that the amount guaranteed pursuant to its Subsidiary Guarantee is the amount set forth in clause (i) above unless any creditor, or representative of creditors of such Guarantor, or debtor in possession or trustee in bankruptcy of such Guarantor, otherwise proves in such a lawsuit that the aggregate liability of such Guarantor is the amount set forth in clause (ii) above. In making any determination as to solvency or sufficiency of capital of a Guarantor in accordance with the previous sentence, the right of such Guarantor to contribution from other Guarantors as set forth below, and any other rights such Guarantor may have, contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account.
provided that
     In order to provide for just and equitable contribution among the Guarantors, the Guarantors shall agree, inter se, that in the event any payment or distribution is made by any Guarantor (a "") under its Subsidiary Guarantee, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from all other Guarantors in a amount based on the Adjusted Net Assets of each Guarantor (including the Funding Guarantor) for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Funding Guarantor in discharging the Company's
Funding Guarantor
pro rata
 
obligations with respect to the Notes or any other Guarantor's Obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee.

Trustee to Include Paying Agent.
     In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "" as used in this Article XI shall in each case (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully and for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article XI in place of the Trustee.

     (i) use their respective reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite financial statements for the period specified in Section 3 or 4 of this Agreement, as applicable; upon the occurrence of any event that would cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or omission or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the period required by this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such Registration Statement, (1) in the case of clause (A), correcting any such misstatement or omission, and (2) in the case of either clause (A) or (B), use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and such Registration Statement and the related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purpose(s) as soon as practicable thereafter;
     (ii) use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for the applicable period set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and to comply fully with the applicable provisions of Rules 424, 430A and 462, as applicable, under the Securities Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Holder or to any director, officer or controlling person of such Holder.
          (b) Each Holder, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors and their respective directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments or actions, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, any Guarantor or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the
 
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company, the Guarantors and any such director, officer or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company, any Guarantor or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Holder may otherwise have to the Company, any Guarantor or any such director, officer or controlling person.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b) (the "") of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any person against whom indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b) (the ""), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the responsibility of the indemnifying party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of the indemnifying party's election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In addition, any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) of all indemnified parties, and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Purchasers in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other, from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Initial Notes purchased under the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company on the one hand, and the total net proceeds received by such Holder upon its resale of Notes less the amount paid by such Holder for such Notes, on the other hand, bear to the total sum of such amounts. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or such Holder, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Solely for the purposes of the preceding two sentences, the net proceeds received by the Company shall be deemed also to be indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantors and the information supplied by the Company shall also be deemed to have been supplied by the Guarantors. The Company and the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
 
method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8, shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Holder, and none of its directors, officers or controlling persons, shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total net proceeds received by such Holder upon its resale of Notes exceeds the sum of the amount paid by such Holder for such Notes and the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.
          (e) The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
          The Company and the Guarantors hereby agree with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company and the Guarantors are subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available to any Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A.
