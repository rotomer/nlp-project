Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Corporation Announces Second Quarter Results; Achieves Year-End Debt Target Early SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 7, 2007--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported record second quarter net income of $443 million, or $3.17 per share, compared to $326 million, or $2.33 per share in the second quarter of 2006. Year-to-date net income totaled $559 million, or $4.02 per share, which is $190 million or 51% ahead of 2006. Year-to-date refinery operating income has surpassed one billion dollars compared to $718 million in the same period last year. The improvement is primarily attributable to increases in throughput and clean product margins. The Company achieved 91% utilization rates for the second quarter, excluding results from the Los Angeles refinery. "While the addition of the Los Angeles refinery positively impacts our year over year comparisons, approximately 90% of our second quarter earnings growth was from our existing system," said Bruce Smith, Tesoro's Chairman, President and CEO. "It was a busy quarter for the company. We successfully integrated the new Shell and USA retail assets, integrated the Los Angeles refinery and completed two turnarounds at the facility. Now that Los Angeles has finished its scheduled maintenance for the year, we expect the refinery to run at higher throughput rates and to capture a greater percentage of the available margin than we recorded in the second quarter," said Smith. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to remain at $900 million. In 2007, the Company has completed the Amorco wharf crude oil blending project at Golden Eagle, installed the new diesel desulphurization unit in Alaska, and upgraded the catalytic cracker unit at Salt Lake City. In the third quarter the Company expects to increase the sulfur handling capabilities of the Anacortes refinery, thereby increasing the amount of sour crude the refinery can process. The Golden Eagle coker modification project is on budget and on track to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. At the end of June, the Company's debt to capitalization was 37%. By August 3rd the Company repaid all outstanding borrowings on our revolving line of credit. Including the debt repayments subsequent to the quarter, our pro-forma debt to capitalization ratio would have been 33% at June 30, 2007. "One of our main goals this year was to reduce our debt-to-capitalization ratio to below 40% by year end, which we achieved almost six months early. The Company does not have additional debt that can be repaid, so cash flow will now be directed towards organic capital projects. We believe these programs offer the opportunity to continue to substantially increase shareholder value," said Smith. Los Angeles Refinery Update Operating income from the Los Angeles refinery was $23 million for the 51 days in the second quarter the Company held operational control and includes $30 million negative impact associated with building inventory to required levels. Throughput and yield averages over the 51 days of operation were 89 thousand barrels-per-day (bpd) and 103 thousand bpd, respectively. "We are enthused by the results we've seen in our first few months of operations, even with the extensive maintenance we have completed," said Smith. "While we understand there is work to be done, we are confident in the team we have assembled to execute our capital program." As previously disclosed, the Company plans to spend a billion dollars in capital at the refinery over the next four to five years to improve operations, increase throughput and fulfill environmental regulations. "Synergistic benefits from the acquisition, which we expect to be $100 million in the first twelve months of operations, are being achieved as planned. In terms of feedstocks, we are seeing benefits in both the grades of crude oil and shipping costs. Additionally, the trading and supply team is finding greater flexibility in optimizing intermediate products such as naphtha and reformate around our west coast assets. I expect our team to continue uncovering opportunities that unlock the earnings power of the system we have put together," said Smith. Board Declares Quarterly Dividend Tesoro announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable September 17th, 2007 to shareholders of record as of September 3rd, 2007.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel is calculated by dividing manufacturing costs by total refining throughput and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (d) Gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. The adjustment for changes in refined product inventory resulted in a decrease in gross refining margin of $43 million and $27 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $14 million and $13 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross refining margin also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (e) Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.34 and $1.01 for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $1.36 and $1.06 for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (f) Sources of total refined product sales include products manufactured at the refineries and products purchased from third parties. Total refined product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products and the effects of inventory changes.
