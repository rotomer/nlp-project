Exhibit 99.1 Tesoro Corporation Announces Third Quarter Results SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 1, 2007--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported net income of $47 million, or $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2007, compared to $274 million, or $1.96 per share in the third quarter of 2006. Year-to-date net income totaled $606 million, or $4.35 per share versus $643 million, or $4.58 per share a year ago. Quarterly benchmark crack spreads in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions were down 28% and 34%, respectively from a year ago. Consequently, refining margins during the quarter of $9.09 per throughput barrel were $6.16 below those in the third quarter of 2006. "The industry experienced a significant increase in crude prices in the third quarter, while product prices rose at a much slower rate," said Bruce Smith, Tesoro's Chairman, President and CEO. "These market fundamentals were the single biggest impact to our quarterly earnings versus last year. The lower margin environment and rapid rise in crude price also negatively impacted other segments of our business, including marketing and our long haul crude hedge program," said Smith. The reduction to refinery margins from the realized and unrealized third quarter hedge program was $28 million. Operationally, the company reported throughput of 654 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) for the quarter. Overall refinery utilization was good, although the company did experience some unplanned downtime at our Anacortes and Golden Eagle refineries. Throughput for the quarter at the Golden Eagle refinery was 11 mbpd lower than a year ago and is associated with work performed on the coker and other downstream units. This also increased feedstock cost and reduced clean product production. The Amorco wharf project, completed during the quarter at a cost of $26 million, offset a portion of the impact of the coker downtime by providing improved crude flexibility allowing increased utilization of other conversion units. The project contribution is estimated at $11 million for the quarter. The sulfur handling unit project at Anacortes was completed during the quarter and will allow for twice the refinery's historic sour crude throughput. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to remain at $900 million. As of today, the company has completed substantially all of the major income improvement projects associated with the 2007 capital program. "As we move into 2008, shareholders should continue to expect to see our discretionary capital program focused on reliability improvements and cost savings initiatives. Our successful execution of the 2007 capital program serves as the foundation for continued capital stewardship of free cash flow going forward," said Smith. Los Angeles Refinery Update Throughput at the refinery, including feedstocks, was 110 mbpd. Gross refining margin and direct operating expense for the quarter were $8.61 and $5.77 per barrel, respectively. "Throughput and product yields are currently ahead of our early expectations," said Smith. "While market fundamentals in the quarter of historically low crack spreads and rapidly rising crude cost impacted the refinery's profitability, we are pleased with our operational performance. As we move forward, we expect to realize additional benefits in exiting supply contracts, supply diversification and enhancing existing logistics," said Smith. Retail Operations Update Retail operating income during the quarter was $4 million including an impairment of $6 million for certain retail sites. Volume and margins for the newly acquired Shell and USA brand sites were in line with expectations. Additional USA brand expenses to improve operating standards, store enhancements and security are expected to impact earnings for the next three quarters. "We have high expectations for the USA brand, and to meet our company's long-term strategy around retail, we need to make additional investments. Our retail strategy is a selective process aimed at matching each refinery's production with its distribution needs. The addition of the acquired retail assets has allowed us to achieve a more optimum channel of trade balance," said Smith. Board Declares Quarterly Dividend Tesoro announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable December 17th, 2007 to shareholders of record as of December 3rd, 2007.

Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources. Manufacturing costs per barrel is calculated by dividing manufacturing costs by total refining throughput and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (c)Gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution. Gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel, adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured. The adjustment for changes in refined product inventory resulted in a decrease in gross refining margin of $5 million and $19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $19 million and $32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross refining margin also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. (d)Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.35 and $0.97 for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $1.35 and $1.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (e)Sources of total refined product sales include products manufactured at the refineries and products purchased from third parties. Total refined product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products and the effects of inventory changes.
