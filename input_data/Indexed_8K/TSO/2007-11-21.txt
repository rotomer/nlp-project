Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 21, 2007 Tesoro Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the adoption of a stockholder rights plan. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The stockholder rights plan is embodied in the Rights Agreement dated as of November 20, 2007 (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent"), which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1. For a description of the material terms of the Rights Agreement and the rights to be issued pursuant thereto, please refer to Item 3.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3.03 Material Modifications to Rights of Security Holders
On November 20, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock, par value $0.16/ per share (the "Common Shares"), and authorized the issuance of one Right for each Common Share which shall become outstanding between the Record Date (as hereinafter defined) and the earliest of the Distribution Date (as hereinafter defined), the redemption of the Rights, or the final expiration date of the Rights. The dividend is payable at the close of business on December 3, 2007 (the "Record Date") to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, no par value (the "Preferred Shares"), of the Company at a price of $200.00 (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement between the Company and the Rights Agent.

Initially, the Rights will be attached to the Common Shares then outstanding, and no separate certificates evidencing the rights ("Rights Certificates") will be issued. The Rights will separate from the Common Shares, Rights Certificates will be issued and the Rights will become exercisable on the tenth day (the "Distribution Date") after the public announcement by the Company or an Acquiring Person (as defined below) that such Acquiring Person has become an Acquiring Person, or such earlier date as a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company becomes aware of the existence of an Acquiring Person. An "Acquiring Person" is a person that, together with its affiliates and associates, is the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Shares. Certain persons, including the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, and Company benefit plan related holders are excluded from the definition of Acquiring Person. Moreover, a person or group of affiliated or associated persons who acquires the beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding either (i) by reason of share purchases by the Company reducing the number of Common Shares outstanding (provided such person or group does not acquire additional Common Shares), or (ii) inadvertently, if the Company's Board of Directors determines such 20% beneficial ownership was acquired inadvertently and as promptly as practicable such person or group divests itself of enough Common Shares so as to no longer to have the beneficial ownership of 20% of the outstanding Common Shares, will not be an Acquiring Person.
 
Until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Share certificates outstanding on or after the Record Date, by such Common Share certificates with a copy of the Summary of Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) attached thereto. The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption, exchange or expiration of the Rights), new Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date, upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares, will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption, exchange or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date also will constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate Rights Certificates will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on November 20, 2010 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company, in each case, as described below.
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Preferred Shares or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights, are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Shares of certain rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Shares with a conversion price, less than the then current market price of the Preferred Shares, or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends paid out of earnings or retained earnings or dividends payable in Preferred Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). The number of interests in Preferred Shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights is also subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Common Shares.
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) will be issued, and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
Preferred Shares will not be redeemable and will be, in ranking as to dividend and liquidation preferences, senior to the Common Shares. Each Preferred Share will be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of the greater of (i) $1.00 per share, or (ii) 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all non-cash dividends and other distributions (other than dividends payable in Common Shares) declared per Common Share. In the event of a liquidation, the holders of the interests in Preferred Shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share plus any
 
accrued and unpaid dividends, but will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per Common Share. Each Preferred Share will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Shares. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Shares are exchanged, each Preferred Share will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per Common Share. The rights of the Preferred Shares as to dividends, liquidation and voting, and in the event of mergers and consolidations, are protected by customary antidilution provisions.
In the event any person becomes an Acquiring Person, then each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and its affiliates and associates (which will thereafter be null and void for all purposes of the Rights Agreement and the holder thereof shall thereafter have no rights with respect to such Rights, whether under the Rights Agreement or otherwise), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the Purchase Price. Under some circumstances, in lieu of Common Shares, other equity and debt securities, property, cash or combinations thereof, including combinations with Common Shares, may be issued upon payment of the Purchase Price, of equal value to the number of Common Shares for which the Right is exercisable.
In the event that after a person has become an Acquiring Person, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power is sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or affiliates or associates thereof) will thereafter generally have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current Purchase Price, that number of shares of the senior voting stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
At any time prior to the date of a public announcement by the Company or an Acquiring Person that such Acquiring Person has become an Acquiring Person, or such earlier date as a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company shall become aware of the existence of an Acquiring Person (the "Shares Acquisition Date"), the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per right (the "Redemption Price"), which may be paid in cash or with Common Shares or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
Between 90 and 120 days after the commencement of a Qualified Offer (as defined below), the holders of ten percent (10%) or more of the Common Shares then outstanding (excluding Common Shares beneficially owned by the person or entity making the Qualified Offer and such person's affiliates and associates) may, by notice (a "Special Meeting Notice"), require the Company to call a special meeting of the stockholders to vote on a resolution authorizing the redemption of all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price (the "Redemption Resolution"). The Board of Directors of the Company must cause the Rights to be redeemed or otherwise prevent the Rights from interfering with the consummation of the Qualified Offer if the special stockholders meeting is not held within 90 days of the Special Meeting Notice (which period may be extended to permit the stockholders to vote on a definitive acquisition agreement) or if such meeting is held and the holders of a majority of Common Shares outstanding (excluding Common Shares beneficially owned by the person making the Qualified Offer and such person's affiliates
 
and associates) vote in favor of the Redemption Resolution, in each case as long as at such time no Person has become an Acquiring Person and as long as the Qualified Offer continues to be a Qualified Offer prior to the last day of the period in which the special meeting must be held.
A "Qualified Offer" is an offer that is determined by a majority of independent directors of the Company to have (among others) the following characteristics:
          (i) a fully-financed, all-cash tender offer, or an exchange offer offering shares of common stock of the offeror, or a combination thereof, in each such case for all of the outstanding Common Shares at the same per-share consideration;
          (ii) an offer whose per-share offer price is greater than the highest reported market price for the Common Shares in the immediately preceding 24 months;
          (iii) an offer with respect to which a nationally recognized investment banking firm retained by the Board of Directors of the Company does not render an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company that the consideration being offered is either unfair or inadequate;
          (iv) an offer that is not subject to any financing, funding or similar conditions or any requirements with respect to the offeror or its agents being permitted any due diligence on the Company;
          (v) if the offer includes common stock of the offeror, the offeror must allow the Company's investment bank, legal counsel and accountants to perform appropriate due diligence on the offeror;
          (vi) an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that the offer will remain open for at least 120 business days and, if a Special Meeting Notice is given, for at least ten business days after the special stockholders meeting or, if no meeting is held within ninety business days following the Special Meeting Notice, for at least ten business days following such ninety business day period;
          (vii) an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment by the offeror that the offer, if it is otherwise to expire prior thereto, will be extended for at least 20 business days after any increase in the consideration offered or after any bona fide alternative offer is commenced;
          (viii) an offer that is conditioned on a minimum of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Common Shares not held by the person or entity making such offer (and its affiliates and associates) being tendered and not withdrawn as of the offer's expiration date, which condition shall not be waivable;
          (ix) an offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror to consummate, as promptly as practicable upon successful completion of the offer, a second step transaction whereby all Common Shares not tendered into the offer will be acquired at the same consideration per share actually paid pursuant to the offer, subject to any stockholders' statutory appraisal rights;
 
          (x) an offer pursuant to which the Company and its stockholders have received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that no amendments will be made to the offer to reduce the consideration being offered or to otherwise change the terms of the offer in a way that is adverse to a tendering stockholder;
          (xi) an offer (other than an offer consisting solely of cash consideration) pursuant to which the Company has received the written representation and certification of the offeror and its CEO and CFO that all material facts about the offeror have been fully and accurately disclosed and all new facts will be fully and accurately disclosed on a prompt basis while the offer remains open, and all required Exchange Act reports will be filed by the offeror in a timely manner during such period; and
          (xii) if the offer includes non-cash consideration, (A) the non-cash portion of the consideration offered must consist solely of common stock of a Person that is a publicly-owned United States corporation, (B) such common stock must be freely tradable and listed or admitted to trading on either the NYSE or NASDAQ, (C) no stockholder approval of the issuer of such common stock is required to issue such common stock, or, if such approval required, such approval has already been obtained, (D) no person or entity (including its affiliates and associates) beneficially owns more than 15% of the voting stock of the issuer of such common stock at the commencement of the offer or at any time during the offer, (E) no other class of voting stock of the issuer of such common stock is outstanding and (F) the issuer of such common stock meets the registrant eligibility requirements for use of Form S-3 for registering securities under the Securities Act.
A committee of independent directors of the Company will review and evaluate the Rights Agreement at least annually in order to consider whether the maintenance of the Rights Agreement continues to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Following each such review, the committee shall communicate its conclusions to the full Board of Directors of the Company, including any recommendation in light thereof as to whether the Rights Agreement should be modified or the Rights should be redeemed.
Under certain circumstances, after a person or group has become an Acquiring Person but prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights that were or are beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or its affiliates and associates), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right (subject to adjustment).
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
Except as otherwise provided in the Rights Agreement, for so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, amend or supplement the Rights Agreement in any respect without the consent of the holders of Rights. At any time after the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may supplement or amend the Rights Agreement without the consent of the holders of the Rights at any time to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provisions, provided, that the Rights Agreement may not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights
 
(which may not be an Acquiring Person or its affiliates and associates in whose hands Rights are void) or to cause the Rights to again become redeemable.
The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer on the redemption of the Rights by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination that is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders because the Board of Directors may, at its option, at any time prior to the Shares Acquisition Date, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price and the Company's stockholders may take certain actions to permit a stockholder vote on whether to redeem the Rights in cases of a "Qualified Offer," as described above.
A copy of the Rights Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Copies of the Rights Agreement are available free of charge from the Rights Agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The following summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
     Until the close of business on the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Stock certificate with a copy of this Summary of Rights. The "" will be the tenth day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "") has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock (the "").

Shares Acquisition Date
     The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Stock. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new Common Stock certificates issued after the Record Date, upon transfer or new issuance of the Common Stock, will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any of the Common Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, even without a copy of this Summary of Rights, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
Right Certificates
 
     The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on November 20, 2010 (the "") unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company, in each case as described below.
Final Expiration Date
     Each share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will have a preferential quarterly dividend rate equal to the greater of $1.00 per share or 1,000 times the dividend declared on one share of the Common Stock. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the Preferred Stock will receive a preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share, but will be entitled to receive an aggregate liquidation payment equal to 1,000 times the payment made on one share of Common Stock.
     Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes voting together with the Common Stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of Common Stock are exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per one share of Common Stock. The Rights are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions. Because of the nature of the Preferred Stock dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-thousandth interest in a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.
     The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of the Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of the Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends out of earnings or retained earnings at a rate not in excess of 125% of the rate of the last cash dividend theretofore paid or dividends payable in the Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
     The number of outstanding Rights and the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of each Right are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the Common Stock or a stock dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations as of the Common Stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
     In the event that the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its assets or earning power are sold after a person or group has become an Acquiring Person, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the Purchase Price, that number of shares of the senior voting stock of the acquiring company that at the time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the Purchase Price. In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights that were or are beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon
 
exercise that number of shares of the Common Stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.
     With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be issued (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise.
     At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group that will have become void) in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock (or, if there is an insufficient number of issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such exchange, then one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share) per Right (subject to adjustment).
     At any time prior to 5:00 p.m. San Antonio, Texas time on the earlier of (i) the Shares Acquisition Date and (ii) the Final Expiration Date, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right (the ""). In addition, if a Qualified Offer (as described below) is made, the record holders of 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock may direct the Board of Directors of the Company to call a special meeting of stockholders to consider a resolution authorizing a redemption of all Rights. If the special meeting is not held within 90 business days of being called or if, at the special meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding (other than shares held by the offeror and its affiliated and associated persons) vote in favor of the redemption of the Rights, then the Board will redeem the Rights or take such other action as may be necessary to prevent the Rights from interfering with the consummation of the Qualified Offer.
Redemption Price
     A Qualified Offer is an offer determined by the Board of Directors of the Company to be a fully-financed offer for all outstanding shares of Common Stock at a per share offer price greater than the highest reported market price for the Common Stock in the immediately preceding 24 months that the Board of Directors of the Company, upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm, does not deem to be either unfair or inadequate. A Qualified Offer is conditioned upon a minimum of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock not held by the offeror (and its affiliated and associated persons) being tendered and not withdrawn, with a commitment to acquire all shares of Common Stock not tendered for the same consideration. If the Qualified Offer includes non-cash consideration, such consideration must consist solely of freely-tradeable common stock of a publicly traded company, and the board and its representatives must be given access to conduct a due diligence review of the offeror to determine whether the consideration is fair and adequate. A Qualified Offer must also remain open for at least 120 business days following commencement.
 
     Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company to redeem or exchange the Rights, the Company shall make announcement thereof, and upon such action, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price, or the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock exchangeable for the Rights, as applicable.
     Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
     A committee of independent directors of the Company will review and evaluate the Rights Agreement at least annually in order to consider whether the maintenance of the Rights Agreement continues to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Following each such review, the committee shall communicate its conclusions to the full Board of Directors, including any recommendation in light thereof as to whether the Rights Agreement should be modified or the Rights should be redeemed.

     The Board of Directors of ("Tesoro") (NYSE: TSO) today announced that it will remain neutral and will not make any recommendation to the Company's stockholders as to whether they should participate in the tender offer made by Tracinda Corporation on November 7, 2007. Tracinda's offer provides for the cash purchase of up to 21,875,000 shares of the Company's common stock (approximately 16 percent) at a price of $64 per share.
SAN ANTONIO  November 21, 2007 
Tesoro Corporation
     "We have a long-standing value creation strategy in place, focused on operational excellence initiatives, system synergies, organic growth opportunities and growth by acquisition which has increased shareholder value 70 percent over the past year and more than 200 percent over the past three years," said Bruce A. Smith, Tesoro Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "As one of the largest independent refiners on the West Coast, we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders."
     Unless extended, Tracinda's tender offer will expire on December 6, 2007, at 11:59 pm ET. Additional information regarding the Board's determination on the tender offer, including a copy of Tesoro's statement on Schedule 14D-9, will be made available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website, .

Stockholder Rights Plan
     Tesoro's Board of Directors also announced today that it has unanimously adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. The rights plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that a potential acquirer would gain control of Tesoro by open market accumulation or other coercive takeover tactics without paying a premium for all of the Company's shares. To implement the plan, Tesoro's Board of Directors declared that each stockholder of record on December 3, 2007 will receive a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of Common Stock held.
     In addition to the customary provisions, the rights plan includes a number of features the Board considers shareholder friendly including a threshold for triggering exercise of the rights plan at 20 percent of the outstanding shares of Tesoro common stock; a three-year fixed term for the rights plan; and a provision requiring a committee of independent directors to assess annually whether the rights plan remains in the best interests of Tesoro's stockholders. The rights plan also includes a provision that states that the rights plan will not be triggered by a "Qualifying Offer" if holders of at least 10 percent of the outstanding shares of Tesoro common stock request that a special meeting of stockholders be convened for the purposes of exempting such offer from the rights plan, and thereafter the stockholders vote at such meeting to exempt the "Qualifying Offer" from the rights plan (excluding, in each case, the shares held by the person making the "Qualifying Offer").
     Based upon the information disclosed by Tracinda in its Schedule TO filed with the SEC, the rights plan will not be triggered by the successful completion of Tracinda's announced tender offer, as the tender offer would result in Tracinda acquiring approximately 19.98 percent of the outstanding shares of Tesoro common stock as of November 19, 2007, after including the shares currently held by Tracinda.
     Details of the rights plan, including a copy of the rights plan, will be filed on November 21, 2007 with the SEC and will be accessible via the EDGAR database on the SEC's web site at .
