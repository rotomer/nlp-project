Item 5.02(e) Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Tesoro Corporation (or the "Company") previously reported that the terms of the 2008 incentive compensation program (the "2008 Program") for named executive officers would be disclosed, as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 30, 2008, upon approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. On February 28, 2008 the Compensation Committee approved the 2008 Program covering Tesoro's named executive officers and certain other officers of the Company ("Participants"). Except as noted otherwise, the 2008 Program covers a one-year performance period ending December 31, 2008. The Company's 2008 earnings before interest and financing costs, interest income and other, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") must meet a threshold level of $1 billion or greater before any percentage of the 2008 Program is funded. If the EBITDA performance threshold is achieved, cash bonuses will be distributed to Participants based on the following performance metrics: (i) total shareholder return relative to Tesoro's peer group (Valero Energy Corporation and Sunoco, Inc.) on a cumulative two-year basis measured at the end of 2008 with no bonuses paid for this portion of the 2008 Program if total shareholder return is negative for the two-year period; (ii) a combination of a corporate-wide and business unit scorecards containing quantitative measurements of safety, capital management, expense control, and cash improvement initiatives among others; and (iii) a discretionary evaluation by the Board of Directors of a Participant's individual performance.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
