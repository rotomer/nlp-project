Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Announces Second Quarter Results
SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported second quarter 2008 net earnings of $4 million, or $0.03 per share. Net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $443 million, or $3.17 per share. After a marginal tax rate of 39%, unusual items in second quarter 2008 include:
Loss of $81 million, $0.58/share in derivative positions mainly related to the long-haul crude hedge program, which was suspended in May, and
Gain of $48 million, $0.35/share associated with the permanent reduction to inventory versus the start of the year under LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) accounting.
In comparison to last year, lower gross refining margins and higher operating costs were met with reduced refining throughput. Bottom-of-the-barrel products continued their trend of lagging the rapid rise of crude oil prices. During the quarter, fuel oil on the West Coast traded at a $32/bbl discount to ANS crude versus $20/bbl in the first quarter. Total fuel oil production for the quarter was 60 mbpd (thousands of barrels per day) versus a 2007 full year average of 53 mbpd due primarily to planned maintenance activity at our Golden Eagle refinery during the 2008 second quarter. We estimate that our refining operating income was reduced by $71 million or $0.31/share after tax as a result of our refinery turnaround for the planned maintenance. Reported gross refining margins decreased 52% to $10.10/bbl in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $20.98/bbl from a year ago.
Manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization were $297 million for the second quarter of 2008 versus $286 million a quarter ago. Higher energy cost of $27 million related to the increased use and price of natural gas, were offset by an $11 million accrual reversal primarily associated with the retirement of the Golden Eagle fluid coker and $3 million in lower repair and maintenance costs.
The refining sector continues to be impacted by higher crude and energy costs, and lower demand compared to a year ago. Crude prices were up almost $60 per barrel in the quarter, compared to 2007, while preliminary industry data suggests that demand in California is down approximately 5-6%. As a result of these factors, the benchmark West Coast margin was down almost 40% in the quarter versus a year ago.
Our opportunities in this type of environment lie in identifying and executing self-help initiatives such as effectively matching production and inventory levels to consumer demand, optimizing product mix towards more profitable diesel fuel and less discounted fuel oil, and reducing expenses, said Bruce Smith, Tesoros Chairman, President and CEO. Operational improvements for the remainder of 2008 versus the first half of the year include:
Refining lower cost crudes through the newly commissioned delayed coker at the Golden Eagle refinery,
Refining a greater percentage of lower cost, waterborne crude at the Los Angeles refinery,
Performing less planned turnaround activity during the second half of the year, and
Implementing initiatives at the Hawaii refinery primarily focused on benefits from processing lower cost crudes.
2008 Goals Update
In the first quarter, the company announced its goal to realize approximately $750 million to $1 billion of operating cash flow through reductions in operating costs, capital expenditures and working capital to fund short term debt reductions and the $870 million capital program, including turnarounds. As of July 30, there were no borrowings on the revolver and the company had a cash balance of approximately $100 million.
th
The company has done an excellent job executing the plan to lower costs, inventories and capital expenditures without sacrificing safe and reliable operations, and we are positioned to realize further cost reduction initiatives, said Smith.
Board Declares Quarterly Dividend
Tesoro announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable September 16, 2008 to shareholders of record as of September 2, 2008.

This earnings release contains certain statements that are "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the market environment, and our expectations about expense and capital reductions.
For more information concerning factors that could affect these statements see our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or which we become aware of, after the date hereof."
Note:
Our 2007 results of operations include our Los Angeles refinery assets and retail stations since acquired in May 2007.
(a)
During the 2008 second quarter, a reduction in inventory quantities resulted in a liquidation of applicable LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs in the prior year.
This LIFO liquidation resulted in a decrease of costs of sales of $78 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008.
(b)
Other income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 represents refunds received from the Trans Alaska Pipeline System in connection with rulings by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska concerning our protest of intrastate pipeline rates set between 1997 and 2003.
(c)
The assumed conversion of common stock equivalents produced anti-dilutive results for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and was not included in the dilutive calculation.
(d)
In the 2007 fourth quarter, we redefined heavy crude oil as crude oil with an American Petroleum Institute gravity of 24 degrees or less. Previously, heavy crude oils were defined as crude oils with a gravity of 32 degrees or less.
Heavy and light throughput volumes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 have been adjusted to conform to the 2008 presentation.
(e)
In the 2007 fourth quarter, we revised the calculation of gross refining margin per throughput barrel to include the effect of inventory changes. Inventory changes are the result of selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured.
The amounts for the three and six ended June 30, 2007 have been recalculated to conform to the 2008 presentation. Previously, gross refining margin per barrel was calculated based upon manufactured product volumes.
Management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry.
Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies.
Gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution. Management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations.
Manufacturing costs per barrel is calculated by dividing manufacturing costs by total refining throughput and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
(f)
Consolidated gross refining margin totals gross refining margin for each of our regions adjusted for other costs not directly attributable to a specific region. Other costs resulted in an increase of $3 million and decrease of $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 and an increase of $4 million and decrease of $12 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross refining margin includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market. Gross refining margin approximates total refining throughput times gross refining margin per barrel.
(g)
Beginning in 2008, we reclassified certain environmental expenses from manufacturing expenses to other operating expenses.
We have reclassified $1 million and $3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively, to conform to the 2008 presentation.
(h)
Includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately $1.41 and $1.34 for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $1.33 and $1.36 for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
(i)
Sources of total refined product sales included refined products manufactured at the refineries and refined products purchased from third parties.
Total refined product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased refined products and the effects of inventory changes.
(j)
We experienced reduced throughput during scheduled turnarounds at the Golden Eagle refinery during the 2008 first and second quarters, the Washington refinery during the 2008 first quarter, the Los Angeles refinery during the 2007 second quarter and the Golden Eagle and Utah refineries during the 2007 first quarter.
(k)
Volumes and margins for 2007 include the Los Angeles refinery since acquired in May 2007.
(l)
The retail operating data for 2007 includes the Shell and USA Gasoline stations since acquired in May 2007.
(m)
Management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare profitability to other companies in the industry.
Fuel margin per gallon is calculated by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volume and may not be calculated similarly by other companies.
Investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance.
This financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to segment operating income and revenues or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
(n)
Includes the effect of intersegment purchases from the refining segment at prices which approximate market.
(o)
Represents impairment charges of $11 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008 related to certain retail stations.
