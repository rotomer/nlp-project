On October 13, 2008 Tesoro Corporation issued a press release to announce certain projected financial results for the 2008 third quarter. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 99.1 discloses the net debt to net capitalization ratio. Net debt represents total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents the total of net debt and total stockholders' equity. The Company believes net debt to net capitalization is useful in measuring financial leverage as we have historically used cash to prepay outstanding notes. Net debt to net capitalization should not be considered as an alternative to debt to capitalization or any measure of financial leverage presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Net debt to net capitalization may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. After our quarterly financial results are finalized, a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization will be provided in Form 8-K for the 2008 third quarter earnings conference call scheduled for October 30, 2008.
The press release is being furnished, not filed, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K. Accordingly, the information in Item 7.01 of this Current Report, including the Press Release, will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated by reference.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
