      (NYSE:TSO) announced today that it expects fourth quarter 2008 earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.75 per share, which includes net one-time adjustments of approximately $(0.29) per share. The one-time adjustments, using a marginal tax rate of 38%, include a $(0.41) per share after-tax accrual for doubtful accounts receivable, partially offset by an accrual reversal of $0.12 per share after-tax following a reduction in estimated costs associated with asset retirement obligations. In the course of our review of accounts receivable, we identified one material account as to which collection in the ordinary course of business was deemed to be unlikely. As a matter of prudence, we have fully reserved the account although rigorous collection efforts are being pursued.

Operating Results
          For the fourth quarter 2008, total throughput is expected to be approximately 555,000 barrels per day versus our guidance of 575,000 barrels per day. Lower rates were mainly due to the December coker disruption at Los Angeles and unplanned downtime at Anacortes. The Company estimates its fourth quarter 2008 gross margin, excluding the significant one-time adjustments, will be approximately $12.00 to $12.50 per barrel or 135% of the TSO benchmark index of $9.21 per barrel. Retail margins in the fourth quarter 2008 were consistent with those realized in the third quarter 2008.
