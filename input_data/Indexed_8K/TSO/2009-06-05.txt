with the written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein and described in Section 8(e). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company or any of the Guarantors may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of any Underwriter.
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors, and their respective directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, any such director, officer or any controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with the written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein and described in Section 8(e), and shall reimburse the Company and the Guarantors and any such director, officer or any such controlling person, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantors or any such director, officer or any controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company and the Guarantors or any such director, officer or any controlling person.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , that the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent all indemnified par-

ties who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the indemnified parties against the indemnifying party under this Section 8 if, (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have engaged counsel reasonably promptly to take charge of the defense of such action or (iii) counsel for any of the indemnified parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to the indemnified parties that are in addition to or in conflict with those available to the indemnifying party, and, in that event, the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party; , , that in connection with any proceedings or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the legal fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel).

No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not contain any statement as to any finding of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss of liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Notes purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes under this Agreement.
 
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Solely for the purposes of the preceding two sentences, the net proceeds received by the Company shall be deemed also to be indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantors and the information supplied by the Company shall also be deemed to have been supplied by the Guarantors. The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes sold and distributed by it was offered to the purchasers exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
          (e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that the statements with respect to the offering and stabilization of the Notes set forth in the third paragraph, the third and fourth sentences of the sixth paragraph, the seventh paragraph, the ninth paragraph and the tenth paragraph in the "Underwriting" section of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
          If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the ""), the remaining Underwriters shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other Underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth: if, however, the Underwriters shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:

spect to the Notes bear to the purchase obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters with respect to the Notes; , that no non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated by this provision to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of Notes that it agreed to purchase pursuant to the terms of Section 2, or

     (b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
          No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
          In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 9.
          The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by them by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market or in the over-the-counter market, or trading in any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, shall have been suspended or the settlement of such trading generally shall have been materially disrupted or minimum prices shall have been established on any such exchange or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or state authorities of the United States, (iii) since the date of this Agreement, the United States shall have become engaged in hostilities, there shall have been a significant escalation in hostilities involving the United States or there shall have been a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in general domestic or international economic, political or financial conditions, including without limitation as a result of terrorist activities after the date hereof, or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States or shall be such, as to make it in the case of (iii) or (iv), in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
10. Termination

          If the sale of Notes provided for herein is not consummated because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantors shall reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel and for such other out-of-pocket expenses as shall have been incurred by them in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Notes, and upon demand the Company and the Guarantors shall pay the full amount thereof to the Underwriters. If this Agreement is terminated by any party hereto for any other reason, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall

Each Guarantor, to the extent permitted by law, hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the Obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture or upon the release of such
 
Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to hereof. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors, or any Note Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by the Company or any Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, the Subsidiary Guarantees, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to, and hereby waives, any right to exercise any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any Obligations guaranteed hereby, except as provided under hereof. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in hereof for the purposes of its Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Obligations as provided in hereof, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for the purpose of its Subsidiary Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor pursuant to hereof after the Notes and the Obligations hereunder shall have been paid in full to the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantees.
