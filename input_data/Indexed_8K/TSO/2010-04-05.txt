ITEM 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On March 30, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Tesoro Corporation (the "Company") elected Gregory J. Goff as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and to the Company's Board of Directors, each effective May 1, 2010. As contemplated by the Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Bruce Smith, which was filed on a Form 8-K on August 4, 2009, Mr. Smith will continue to serve as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer until his retirement on May 1, 2010, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors and as Chairman of the Board through the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is scheduled to be held on June 4, 2010.
Mr. Goff, 53, has served as Senior Vice President, Commercial for ConocoPhillips Corporation ("ConocoPhillips"), an international, integrated energy company, since 2008. Mr. Goff has held various other positions at ConocoPhillips since 1981, including director and CEO of Conoco JET Nordic from 1998 to 2000; chairman and managing director of Conoco Limited, a UK-based refining and marketing affiliate, from 2000 to 2002; president of ConocoPhillips European and Asia Pacific downstream operations from 2002 to 2004; president of ConocoPhillips U.S. Lower 48 and Latin America exploration and production business from 2004 to 2006; and president of ConocoPhillips specialty businesses and business development from 2006 to 2008.
On March 30, 2010, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Goff (the "Agreement"). The Agreement provides that Mr. Goff will be employed for a three-year term commencing on May 1, 2010, with an initial annual base salary of $900,000 and a target cash bonus under the Company's annual incentive compensation program equal to 100% of base salary. As an inducement to entering into the Agreement Mr. Goff also will receive:
The equity awards described above will vest 100% if Mr. Goff terminates employment due to death, total disability, without cause, with good reason or in connection with a change in control (each as defined in the Agreement). In the event Mr. Goff's employment is terminated by the Company for cause during the term of the Agreement, the Company will seek repayment or recovery (a "clawback") of the equity awards and cash payments described above, as appropriate.
Certain Payments upon Termination
If Mr. Goff is terminated without cause or with good reason, as defined in the Agreement, he will receive a cash payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary (as then in effect) plus the greater of his highest annual bonus earned under the applicable annual incentive compensation plan of the Company during the preceding three years or $450,000.
If Mr. Goff is terminated without cause or with good reason, as defined in the Agreement, within two years following a change in control, he will be entitled to a cash payment equal to three times the sum of his salary plus his target bonus (in each case as then in effect); plus a pro rata annual incentive bonus equal to Mr. Goff's base salary multiplied by his annual incentive bonus target percentage, each as then in effect, pro-rated as of the effective date of the termination.
The Agreement contains further compensation and severance provisions that are consistent with the arrangements for other senior management of the Company and are described in more detail in the Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
     This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of May 1, 2010 (the "Effective Date") by and between Tesoro Corporation (the "Company"), and Gregory J. Goff ("Executive");
WITNESSETH THAT:
     the Company wishes to employ Executive as its President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive wishes to accept such employment; and
WHEREAS,
     the Company and Executive wish to formalize the employment relationship in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below in this Agreement.
WHEREAS,
     in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and conditions set forth herein, including but not limited to Executive's employment and the payments and benefits described herein, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and Executive hereby agree as follows:
NOW THEREFORE,
Subject to Executive's satisfactory passage of a routine pre-employment drug test and satisfactory completion of a criminal background check, both of which are applicable generally to all new hires of the Company, the Company shall employ Executive, and Executive shall be employed by the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
The term of this Agreement shall be a three (3) year period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on April 30, 2013. The period during which Executive is employed hereunder shall be referred to as the "Employment Period." Either the Company or Executive shall have the right to terminate the Employment Period and, subject to the survival provisions of Section 17, this Agreement at any time in accordance with Section 5 below. Upon the expiration of the term of this Agreement (if the Employment Period and this Agreement are not earlier terminated in accordance with Section 5), Executive's employment shall continue on an "at will" basis.
 
(i) An award of the number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to the quotient of $100,000 divided by the closing price of a share of the Company's common stock on May 3, 2010;
(ii) An award of that number of restricted stock units equal to the quotient of $3,500,000 divided by the closing price of a share of the Company's common stock on May 3, 2010, which will vest fifty percent (50%) on May 3, 2011, and fifty percent (50%) on May 3, 2012, subject (except as otherwise provided below) to Executive's continuous employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date and such other terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee of the Board shall decide;
(iii) An award of that number of stock options for the Company's common stockthe fair market value of which options, using the Black-Scholes method as described on , on May 3, 2010 will be $250,000, which stock
,
Attachment 1
 
options will have an exercise price equal to fair market value (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board) on the date of grant and will vest thirty percent (30%) on May 3, 2011, thirty percent (30%) on May 3, 2012, and forty percent (40%) on May 3, 2013, subject (except as otherwise provided below) to Executive's continuous employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date, a ten (10) year term, and such other terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee of the Board shall decide; and
(iv) An award of that number of shares of restricted common stock equal to the quotient of $250,000 divided by the closing price of a share of the Company's common stock on May 3, 2010, which will vest one hundred percent (100%) on the first anniversary of the Effective Date at which time the stock will be unrestricted, subject (except as otherwise provided below) to Executive's continuous employment with the Company through such anniversary date and such other terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee of the Board shall decide.
In the event that Executive's employment terminates as described in Sections 6(a), 6(b), 6(e) or 7(a) below, then the inducement awards described in Section 4(c)(ii), (iii) and (iv) above will vest one hundred percent (100%) upon such termination.
As further inducement to entering into this Agreement Executive also shall receive a cash payment of $250,000 on the first anniversary of the Effective Date, subject to Executive's continuous employment with the Company through such date.
In addition, in the event that Executive dies, becomes physically or mentally incapacitated such that the Company determines that Executive would become Totally Disabled as described in Section 5(b) or is informed by the Company that he will not be employed by the Company on May 1. 2010, and such event follows the later of (x) the first date that this Agreement has been executed by both the Company and Executive and (y) the date Executive terminates employment with ConocoPhillips, but before May 1, 2010, then the Company will pay the inducement awards described in this Section 4(c) at the time and in the form described in this Section 4(c) to Executive (or Executive's estate in the event of death), such awards shall be one hundred percent (100%) vested, and such payments shall be Executive's (or Executive's estate) sole remedy under this Agreement.
Finally, in the event Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Company will seek repayment or recovery of the inducement awards paid pursuant to this Section 4(c), as appropriate, notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement.
(d) As further inducement to entering into this Agreement, effective for calendar year 2010, Executive also will be eligible for a longterm incentive award for fiscal year 2010 with a target of $3,000,000, subject to such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee of the Board may in its sole discretion specify; provided that the fiscal year 2010 award will be pro-rated if the grant of long-term incentive awards to other senior executive officers of the Company
ANNUAL LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD.
-
 
occurs prior to the Effective Date. For example, if the grant date for such other executive officers is April 1, 2010, then the target for Executive's 2010 award will be $2,750,000 (11/12 x $3,000,000). In the event that Executive's employment terminates as described in Sections 6(a), 6(b), 6(e) or 7(a) below, then the fiscal year 2010 award will vest one hundred percent (100%) upon such termination. The target awards for fiscal years after 2010 will be at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board. Long-term incentive awards shall be comprised of such mix of equity-based and other long-term incentive awards (for example, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares or units) as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board from time to time, consistent with the mix of equity-based and other long-term incentive awards granted to other senior executive officers of the Company. For fiscal year 2010, it is anticipated that the long-term incentive award will be comprised of the following mix of equity-based and long-term incentive awards: (i) thirty percent (30%) of the total award expected value in stock options; (ii) thirty percent (30%) of the total award expected value in restricted stock (time based vesting); and (iii) forty percent (40%) of the total award expected value in performance units. If an equity-based or long-term incentive award is made to Executive and the financial statements used to determine the amount of the award are materially restated within five (5) years of the end of the period to which such financial statements relate and either (x) the Audit Committee of the Board finds that Executive engaged in malfeasance, fraud or intentional misconduct that contributed (directly or indirectly) to such restatement or that Executive was aware of the acts that contributed (directly or indirectly) to such restatement or (y) the compensation of all senior executives paid with respect to such financial statements is similarly clawed back, the Company will seek repayment or recovery of the award, as appropriate, notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement.
(e) During the Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to participate in any other incentive or supplemental compensation plan or arrangement maintained or instituted by the Company to such extent, if any, as the Compensation Committee of the Board may in its sole discretion from time to time specify.
OTHER COMPENSATION.
(f) During the Employment Period, Executive and/or Executive's family, as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company (including, without limitation, medical, prescription drugs, dental, vision, disability, employee life, group life, accidental death and travel accident insurance plans and programs) and all pension, profit sharing, incentive compensation, and savings plans and all other similar plans and benefits which the Company from time to time makes available to other peer executives of the Company.
OTHER BENEFIT PLANS.
(g) During the Employment Period, the Company will reimburse Executive as provided in the Company's policies, programs and procedures for an initiation fee or fees and dues for a country, luncheon or social club or clubs. In addition, the Company will reimburse Executive for additional initiation fees to the extent the Board or the Governance Committee of the Board determines such fees are reasonable and in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
FEE REIMBURSEMENTS.
 
however, the Company will not reimburse Executive for any of the foregoing fees with respect to an organization that discriminates against individuals on the basis of race, creed or sex.
(h) During the Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by Executive in accordance with the expense reimbursement policies, programs, practices and procedures of the Company in effect for Executive when Executive incurs such reimbursable expenses.
EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT.
(i) The Company will reimburse Executive for reasonable relocation expenses (including a payment to make Executive whole for the loss, if any, up to $150,000, suffered by Executive on the sale of the home, based on the original amount paid by Executive for the home) incurred by Executive associated with Executive's move from his home in Katy, Texas to San Antonio, Texas, as appropriate as determined by the Board in its sole discretion and pursuant to the Company's standard relocation policy in effect on March 29, 2010 (the "Relocation Policy"). If Executive's family relocates to San Antonio, Texas from Utah within the Employment Period, the Company will reimburse Executive for reasonable relocation expenses pursuant to the Relocation Policy (excluding any payment to make Executive whole for any loss suffered by Executive based on the original amount paid by Executive for the Utah home).
RELOCATION.
(j) During the Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to an appropriate office at the Company's principal place of business.
OFFICE AND SUPPORT STAFF.
(k) During the Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to vacation each year in accordance with the Company's executive vacation policy in effect from time to time, but in no event less than four (4) weeks paid vacation per calendar year (prorated for 2010) and an additional one (1) week for five (5) years of service and a further additional one (1) week for ten (10) years of service, up to a maximum of six (6) weeks per calendar year. Executive shall be entitled to such periods of sick leave as is customarily provided by the Company for its senior executive employees.
VACATION.
This Agreement and the Employment Period may be terminated under the following circumstances:
(a) This Agreement and the Employment Period shall terminate upon Executive's death.
DEATH.
(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement and the Employment Period upon Executive becoming "Totally Disabled." For purposes of this Agreement, Executive shall be "Totally Disabled" if Executive has been physically or mentally incapacitated so as to render Executive incapable of performing Executive's material usual and customary duties, with or without reasonable accommodation as required by law, under this Agreement for six (6) consecutive months (such consecutive absence not being deemed interrupted by Executive's return to service for less than ten
TOTAL DISABILITY.
 
(10) consecutive business days if absent thereafter for the same illness or disability). Any such termination shall be upon thirty (30) days written notice given at any time thereafter while Executive remains Totally Disabled, provided that a termination for Total Disability hereunder shall not be effective if Executive returns to full performance of his duties within such thirty (30) day period.
(c) The Company may terminate this Agreement and the Employment Period for "Cause" at any time. If the Company elects to terminate this Agreement and the Employment Period for Cause, the Company shall provide ten (10) days written notice of the Company's intent to terminate this Agreement and the Employment Period for "Cause."
TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY FOR CAUSE.
(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Cause" shall be limited to (A) willful misconduct by Executive with regard to the Company which has a material adverse effect on the Company; (B) the willful refusal of Executive to follow the proper direction of the Board, provided that the foregoing refusal shall not be "Cause" if Executive in good faith believes that such direction is illegal, unethical or immoral and promptly so notifies the Board; (C) the willful refusal by Executive to perform the duties required of him hereunder (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for performance is delivered to Executive by the Board which specifically identifies the manner in which it is believed that Executive has willfully refused to perform his duties hereunder; (D) the material breach by Executive of any of the restrictive covenants of Section 9 hereof or of a fiduciary duty to the Company; (E) the misappropriation by Executive of Company funds or property; or (F) Executive being convicted of, or making a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of, a felony (other than a felony involving a traffic violation or as a result of vicarious liability). For purposes of this paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on Executive's part shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done, by him not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.
(ii) The ten (10) day notice of intent to terminate for Cause shall mean a notice that shall indicate the specific termination provision in Section 5(c)(i) relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances which provide for a basis for termination for Cause. Further, the ten (10) day notice of intent to terminate for Cause shall set the date of termination at least ten (10) days after the date of the notice.
(d) Executive may terminate this Agreement and the Employment Period with or without Good Reason at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Company.
VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY EXECUTIVE.
(i) A Termination for Good Reason means a termination by Executive pursuant to a Notice of Termination for Good Reason as described more fully below given within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the Good Reason event, unless such circumstances are fully corrected prior to the date of
 
termination specified in the Notice of Termination for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence or failure to cause the occurrence, as the case may be, without Executive's express written consent, of any of the following circumstances: (A) a material adverse change in the governing body to which Executive regularly reports, including a requirement that Executive report to another corporate officer rather than to the Board; (B) a material adverse change in the bonus plans, programs or arrangements in which Executive is entitled to participate (the "Bonus Plans") other than a material adverse change in the Bonus Plans that adversely affects other similarly situated executives in a manner proportionate to the material adverse effect of such change on Executive; (C) any material breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 11 hereof; (D) Executive's failure to be elected or reelected to the Board; or (E) the failure of any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by merger, acquisition, consolidation or otherwise) to assume in a writing delivered to Executive upon the assignee becoming such, the obligations of the Company hereunder. Expiration of the term of this Agreement in accordance with the first sentence of Section 2 hereof is not a termination by Executive for Good Reason.
(ii) A Notice of Termination for Good Reason shall mean a written notice that shall indicate the specific Good Reason event relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for Termination for Good Reason. The failure by Executive to set forth in the Notice of Termination for Good Reason any facts or circumstances which contribute to the showing of Good Reason shall not waive any right of Executive hereunder or preclude Executive from thereafter timely asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his rights hereunder. The Notice of Termination for Good Reason shall provide for a date of termination not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the date such Notice of Termination for Good Reason is given. The Company shall have at least thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice to remedy the condition.
(e) The Company may terminate this Agreement and the Employment Period without Cause at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice to Executive. Expiration of the term of this Agreement in accordance with the first sentence of Section 2 hereof is not a termination by the Company without Cause.
TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE.
(f) Upon any termination of this Agreement and the Employment Period prior to the expiration of the term of this Agreement, Executive shall immediately resign from all positions with the Company or any of its subsidiaries held by him at such time.

one-half in a lump sum and one-half in substantially equal monthly installments during the two (2) year period beginning as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the six (6) month period beginning immediately after such termination of employment. Payment of the amount specified under this Section 7(a)(i) shall be in lieu of any amount payable under Section 6(b)(iii) or Section 6(e)(iii).
(ii) Executive will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all benefits, awards, and grants accrued but unpaid under any non-qualified pension plan or supplemental executive plan in which Executive was a participant as of the date of termination. Executive shall also receive a pro rata annual incentive bonus payment in a lump sum equal to his Base Salary multiplied by his annual incentive bonus target percentage, each as then in effect, pro-rated as of the effective date of the termination. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the treatment of equity-based or long-term incentive awards, including (without limitation) stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares or units, will be governed in accordance with the terms of the award agreement governing such award. The vesting, pro rata bonus and equity-based or long-term incentive award rights under this Section 7(a)(ii) shall be in lieu of any such rights Executive would otherwise be entitled to receive under Sections 6(b)(i) and (iv) or Sections 6(e)(v) and (vi).
For purposes of this Agreement, following a Change in Control, the term "Company" shall include the entity surviving such Change in Control.
(b)
POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY.
(i) Notwithstanding any contrary provision, if any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Payment shall be either
(A) delivered in full pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
(B) reduced in accordance with this Section 7(b) to the extent necessary to avoid the Excise Tax,
based on which of (A) or (B) would result in the greater Net After-Tax Receipt to Executive.
For purposes of this Section 7(b),
"Payment" means any payment, distribution, or other benefit provided by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise that constitutes a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code;
"Excise Tax" means the excise imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar or successor provision thereto; and
 
"Net After-Tax Receipt" means the present value (as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code) of the payments net of all applicable federal, state and local income, employment, and other applicable taxes and the Excise Tax.
(ii) If Payments are reduced, the reduction shall be accomplished first by reducing cash Payments under this Agreement, in the order in which such cash Payments otherwise would be paid and then by forfeiting any equity-based awards that vest as a result of the Change in Control, starting with the most recently granted equity-based awards, to the extent necessary to accomplish such reduction.
(iii) All determinations under this Section 7(b) shall be made by the Company's independent accountants or compensation consultants (the "Third Party") and all such determinations shall be conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto. The Company and Executive shall furnish to the Third Party such information and documents as the Third Party may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 7(b). The Company shall bear all fees and costs of the Third Party with respect to all determinations under or contemplated by this Section 7(b).
(c) means (i) there shall be consummated (A) any consolidation or merger of the Company in which the Company is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of the Company's Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the Company where a majority of the board of directors of the surviving corporation are, and for a one (1) year period after the merger continue to be, persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the merger or were elected as directors, or nominated for election as director, by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors of the Company immediately prior to the merger, or (B) any sale, lease, exchange or transfer (in one (1) transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (ii) the shareholders of the Company shall approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (iii) (A) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), other than the Company or a subsidiary thereof or any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or a subsidiary thereof, shall become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company representing thirty-five percent (35%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing in special circumstances) having the right to vote in the election of directors, as a result of a tender or exchange offer, open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, and (B) at any time during a period of one (1) year thereafter, individuals who immediately prior to the beginning of such period constituted the Board shall cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, unless election or the nomination by the Board for election by the Company's shareholders of each new director during such period was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of such period.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
The Company conditions the payment of any severance or other amounts pursuant to Sections 6 and 7 (other than any accrued but unpaid Base Salary for services rendered to the date of termination, any accrued but unpaid expenses required to be reimbursed in accordance with Section 4, any unused vacation as of the date of termination, and any payments under Section 6(a)) upon (a) the delivery by Executive to the Company of a release in the form satisfactory to the Company, substantially in the form attached hereto as , within such time following Executive's termination of employment as will permit the release to become irrevocable on or before the fifty-second (52) day after Executive's termination of employment and (b) such release actually becoming irrevocable by the fifty-second (52) day after Executive's termination of employment. If Executive fails to execute such release or the release does not become irrevocable by the fifty-second (52) day after Executive's termination of employment, Executive will forfeit any benefits under Sections 6 and 7 (other than any accrued but unpaid Base Salary for services rendered to the date of termination, any accrued but unpaid expenses required to be reimbursed in accordance with Section 4, any unused vacation as of the date of termination, and any payments under Section 6(a)). Payment made and performance by the Company in accordance with Sections 6 and 7, as applicable, shall operate to fully discharge and release the Company and its directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, stockholders, successors, assigns, agents and representatives from any further obligation or liability with respect to Executive's rights under this Agreement.
Attachment 2
nd
nd
nd
The Company agrees to provide Executive, upon commencement of employment, with immediate access to Protected Information as defined below, including Protected Information of third parties such as customers, suppliers, and business affiliates; specialized training regarding the Company's methodologies and business strategies; and/or support in the development of goodwill such as introductions, information and reimbursement of customer development expenses consistent with Company policy. The foregoing is not contingent on continued employment, but upon Executive's use of the access, specialized training, and goodwill support provided by the Company for the exclusive benefit of the Company and upon Executive's full compliance with the restrictions on Executive's conduct provided for in this Agreement. Ancillary to the rights provided to Executive as set forth in this Agreement and any addenda or amendments to this Agreement, the Company's provision of Protected Information, specialized training, and/or goodwill support to Executive, and Executive's agreements regarding the use of same, and in order to protect the value of any equity-based or long-term incentive compensation, training, goodwill support and/or the Protected Information described above, the Company and Executive agree to the following provisions against unfair competition:
(a) . Executive recognizes and agrees that in order to assure that Executive devotes all of Executive's professional time and energy to the operations of the Company while employed by the Company, and that during and after such employment in order to adequately protect the Company's investment in its Protected Information and to protect the Protected Information and all other confidential information from disclosures to competitors and to protect the Company from unfair competition, separate covenants not to compete, not to solicit, not
COVENANTS AGAINST UNFAIR COMPETITION
 
to recruit the Company's employees, and not to disclose Protected Information for the duration and scope set forth below, are necessary and desirable. Executive understands and agrees that the restrictions imposed in these covenants represent a fair balance of the Company's rights to protect its business and Executive's right to pursue employment.
(b) Executive covenants and agrees that at all times during the Employment Period and for one (1) year thereafter, Executive will not engage in, assist, or have any active interest or involvement, whether as an employee, agent, consultant, creditor, advisor, officer, director, stockholder (excluding holding of less than three percent (3%) of the stock of a public company), partner, proprietor or any type of principal whatsoever in any person, firm, or business entity which, directly or indirectly, competes with any Business (as defined below) of the Company or its affiliates anywhere in the world where the Company conducts business or, on the last day of the Employment Period, has plans to conduct business in the twelve (12) month period following the last day of the Employment Period, without the Company's specific written consent to do so. As used in this Section 9, the term "Business" shall mean the refining and marketing of petroleum products, as such business may be expanded or altered by the Company during the Employment Period.
COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY.
(c) Executive covenants and agrees that at all times during the Employment Period and for a period of two (2) years after the termination thereof, whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary by wrongful discharge or otherwise, Executive will not directly and personally knowingly (i) induce any customers of the Company or of an affiliate of the Company to patronize any similar business which competes with any material business of the Company or affiliate; (ii) request or advise any customers of the Company or of an affiliate of the Company to withdraw, curtail or cancel such customer's business with the Company or affiliate; or (iii) individually or through any person, firm, association or corporation with which he is now, or may hereafter become associated, solicit, entice or induce any then employee of the Company, or of any affiliate of the Company, to leave the employ of the Company, or such affiliate, to accept employment with, or compensation from Executive, or any person, firm, association or corporation with which Executive is affiliated without prior written consent of the Company. The foregoing shall not prevent Executive from serving as a reference for employees.
NON-SOLICITATION.
(d) Executive recognizes and acknowledges that Executive has had and will continue to have access to various confidential or proprietary information concerning the Company, affiliates of the Company, and its clients and third parties doing business with the Company of a special and unique value which may include, without limitation, (i) books and records relating to operation, finance, accounting, sales, personnel and management, (ii) policies and matters relating particularly to operations such as customer service requirements, costs of providing service and equipment, operating costs and pricing matters, and (iii) various trade or business secrets including customer lists, route sheets, business opportunities, marketing or business diversification plans, business development and bidding techniques, methods and processes, financial data and the like, to the extent not generally known in the industry (collectively, the "Protected Information"). In consideration of the Company
PROTECTED INFORMATION.
 
giving Executive access to Protected Information, Executive covenants and agrees that Executive will not at any time, either during the Employment Period or afterwards, knowingly make any independent use of, or knowingly disclose to any other person or organization (except as authorized by the Company) any of the Protected Information, provided that (I) during the Employment Period, Executive may in good faith make disclosures he believes desirable, and (II) Executive may comply with legal process.
(e) Executive agrees not to disparage or communicate negatively about the business, products, services, customers, directors, management, employees or employment/compensation/benefit practices and policies of the Company or its affiliates at any time, either during the Employment Period or afterwards. The Company agrees not to disparage or communicate negatively about Executive at any time, either during the Employment Period or afterwards. To the extent allowed by law, Executive also agrees not to help, encourage, or participate (directly or indirectly) in any claims or lawsuits against the Company for any claims related to any individual's employment (or separation from employment) with the Company at any time, either during the Employment Period or afterwards. Nothing in this Section 9(e), however, shall be deemed to prevent the Executive or the Company or its affiliates (or the directors, officers or employees of the Company or its affiliates) from testifying fully and truthfully in response to a subpoena from any court or from responding to investigative inquiry from any governmental agency.
NON-DISPARAGEMENT.
 
The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Executive to the fullest extent permitted by law and in accordance with the Indemnification Agreement between the Company and Executive (the "Indemnification Agreement") for any action or inaction of Executive while serving as an officer and director of the Company or, at the Company's request, as an officer or director of any other, entity or as a fiduciary of any benefit plan. The Company shall cover Executive under directors and officers liability insurance both during and, while potential liability exists, after the Employment Period in the same amount and to the same extent as the Company covers its other officers and directors.
The Company and Executive each irrevocably and unconditionally waives all right to trial by jury in any lawsuit, action, proceeding, or counterclaim (whether based in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or arising out of or relating to Executive's employment by the Company. Executive and the Company each further agree that the exclusive forums for the resolution of any disputes between them are the state and Federal courts located in Bexar County, Texas. This waiver of jury trial and forum selection provision applies to disputes between the parties as well as any claim by Executive against any agent, representative, or employee of the Company.
If at any time during the term of this Agreement or for a period of four (4) years after the expiration of this Agreement there should arise any dispute as to the validity, interpretation or application of any term or condition of this Agreement and it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Executive is the prevailing party in such dispute, and all appeals are exhausted and final, the Company agrees, upon written demand by Executive, to promptly reimburse Executive's reasonable costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Executive in connection with reasonably seeking to enforce the terms of this Agreement up to $100,000 in the aggregate for all such disputes. Any such reimbursement shall be made by the Company upon or as soon as practicable following receipt of supporting documentation of the expenses reasonably satisfactory to the Company (but in no event later than March 15th of the calendar year following the calendar year in which it is finally determined that Executive is the prevailing party in such dispute and all appeals are exhausted and final). The expenses paid by the Company during any taxable year of Executive will not affect the expenses paid by the Company in another taxable year. This right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
The provisions of this Section 12, without implication as to any other section hereof, shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and of Executive's employment hereunder.
 
The Company may withhold from any compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement all applicable federal, state, local, or other taxes.
All payments provided under this Agreement, other than payments made pursuant to a plan which provides otherwise, shall be paid from the general funds of the Company, and no special or separate fund shall be established, and no other segregation of assets made, to assure payment. Executive shall have no right, title or interest whatever in or to any investments which the Company may make to aid the Company in meeting its obligations hereunder. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Company.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Executive (but any payments due hereunder which would be payable at a time after Executive's death shall be paid to Executive's designated beneficiary or, if none, his estate) and shall be assignable by the Company only to any financially solvent corporation or other entity resulting from the reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation or entity or any corporation or entity to or with which the Company's business or substantially all of its business or assets may be sold, exchanged or transferred, and it must be so assigned by the Company to, and accepted as binding upon it by, such other corporation or entity in connection with any such reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale, exchange or transfer in a writing delivered to Executive in a form reasonably acceptable to Executive (the provisions of this sentence also being applicable to any successive such transaction).
This Agreement shall supersede any and all existing oral or written agreements, representations, or warranties between Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities relating to the terms of Executive's employment by the Company other than the Indemnification Agreement. It may not be amended except by a written agreement signed by both parties.
Upon the termination of this Agreement, the respective rights and obligations of Executive and the Company under this Agreement shall terminate, except that (a) the provisions of Sections 8 through 21 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect after the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms, and (b) the termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights or obligations of the parties accrued under the express terms of this Agreement prior to or in connection with such termination.
 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to agreements made and to be performed in that State, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
If any amounts which are required, or determined to be paid or payable, or reimbursed or reimbursable, to Executive under this Agreement (or any other plan, agreement, policy or arrangement with the Company) are not so paid promptly at the times provided herein or therein, such amounts shall accrue interest, compounded monthly, at the short-term applicable federal rate for the applicable month of delinquency, as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service by Revenue Ruling, from the date such amounts were required or determined to have been paid or payable, reimbursed or reimbursable to Executive, until such amounts and any interest accrued thereon are finally and fully paid, provided, however, that in no event shall the amount of interest contracted for, charged or received hereunder, exceed the maximum non-usurious amount of interest allowed by applicable law.
