Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Reports Second Quarter Results
SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 28, 2010--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported second quarter 2010 net earnings of $67 million, or $0.47 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $45 million, or $0.33 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2009. The 2010 results include one-time net after-tax benefits of $24 million primarily related to changes to our post-retirement benefits programs. The total after-tax impact for the one-time net benefits in the quarter is $0.17 per diluted share.
Second quarter segment operating income was $153 million excluding the special items, compared to $11 million in the second quarter a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven in large part by stronger distillate margins and improved realizations in our marketing channels. These benefits were partially offset by decreased gasoline margins and reduced throughput. The reduction in throughput was primarily a result of the idled Anacortes refinery and the planned full plant turnaround at our Mandan refinery.
For the second quarter, the Tesoro Index was over $1.40 per barrel higher than a year ago, as a result of improved West Coast benchmark diesel margins, which were up 55%. Gasoline margins however fell by 15% versus a year ago. Tesoro benefited from blending ethanol into gasoline as ethanol prices traded on average $0.55 per gallon below California grade gasoline. The second quarter results also reflect improved performance in both our wholesale and retail marketing channels, as spot prices for gasoline and diesel fell more rapidly than wholesale rack or retail street prices during the period.
We are pleased with our second quarter results, despite the lost opportunity due to the idling of our Anacortes refinery and the full plant turnaround at our Mandan refinery, said Greg Goff, President and CEO of Tesoro. During the quarter we saw improvements in several key economic indicators, including West Coast port and rail activity. We believe these trends drove diesel margins higher. These increases are not, however, being seen in gasoline margins. While gasoline demand has stabilized, high unemployment in California continues to keep demand low.
Capital Spending and Liquidity
Capital spending, including turnarounds, for the second quarter 2010 was $140 million, and the company anticipates capital spending, including turnarounds, for the full year 2010, to be in the range of $475 to $500 million. The company ended the second quarter with $191 million in cash and remained undrawn with $713 million of availability on the revolving credit facility.
While we have seen improvements in the market during the second quarter, we continue to plan for a challenging margin environment and are committed to our improvement initiatives. We are implementing changes to our corporate overhead and benefits programs that we expect will strengthen Tesoro and have an immediate and positive impact on cash flow and earnings, said Goff.
When fully implemented by the end of this year, the changes are expected to reduce cash corporate expenses by an estimated $40 to $50 million and reduce post-retirement benefit expenses by another $80 to $90 million, annually. For the second quarter, the net impact of these changes was a $26 million after-tax benefit to earnings.
Washington Refinery
The repair work at the Anacortes refinery is progressing well and we expect that the plant should be operational as early as September. The company continues to work closely with investigators regarding the incident.
