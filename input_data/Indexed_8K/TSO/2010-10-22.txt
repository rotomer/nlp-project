Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 18, 2010, Tesoro Panama Company, S.A. ("TPSA"), a directly and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesoro Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a uncommitted revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with BNP Paribas, as Administrative and Syndicating Agent for the Lenders, together with its successors in such capacity (the "Administrative Agent") and BNP Paribas Securities Corp, as arranger. TPSA is an excluded and unrestricted subsidiary (as defined) from the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Tesoro's outstanding Indentures. The Credit Agreement is "non-recourse" to the Company, meaning that only TPSA is liable to reimburse BNP Paribas for any borrowed amounts or interest thereon. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, other than the Borrower and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions), are guarantors under the Credit Agreement. This summary of the material terms of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
The Company formed TPSA to further utilize its pipeline and tank assets in Panama by enhancing strategic partnerships, developing economies of scale around freight and storage opportunities, expanding global commercial relationships and evaluating opportunities to source crude from alternative supply markets for trade or transportation.
The Credit Agreement will provide for (a) up to $260 million in an uncommitted, senior-secured revolving credit facility ("Facility A") available for revolving loans, swing line loans, daylight overdraft loans and the issuance on an uncommitted basis of letters of credit ("LCs") and (b) up to $150 million in an uncommitted, senior-secured facility ("Facility B") available for Trade LCs and advances. Facilities A and B are each available on an uncommitted basis subject to the applicable facility maximum amount and collateral pool (at closing the Combined Facility Maximum Amount was $350 million) ($245 million for Facility A and $105 million for Facility B).
The Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature which permits TPSA to increase the facilities up to $700 million provided that the Facilities A and B maximum amounts do not exceed $550 million and $350 million, respectively.
Facility A will be used for advances in connection with the purchase, storage and sale of Product and for related hedging and working capital requirements related to the normal course of business. Facility B will be used to finance TPSA's purchase of Product from suppliers through the issuance of LCs including escalation clauses and is available for advances in connection with the refinancing of Facility B LCs not refinanced under Facility A.
Under the Credit Agreement, each extension of credit will bear interest, at the following rates per annum:
The Credit Agreement contains the following default financial covenants:

Interest

plus
     (ii) If such Loan is a Revolving Loan, during such periods as such Revolving Loan is an Alternative Base Rate Loan, the Alternative Base Rate the Applicable Margin; and

after as well as before any entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.
     (c) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) (A) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the last day of each Interest Period therefore and the Maturity Date thereof, and (B) with respect to Alternative Base Rate Loans, on the last day of each calendar month and on the Maturity Date of such Loan, and (ii) upon the payment or prepayment thereof or the Conversion of such Loan to a Loan of another Type (but only on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or Converted), except that interest payable at the Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand of the Required Lenders. Promptly after the determination of any interest rate provided for herein or any change therein, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and to the Borrower.
     (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required for any period for which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by the Administrative Agent would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to the Administrative Agent limiting the highest rate of interest that may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by the Administrative Agent, and in such event the Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent interest at the highest rate permitted by applicable law.
     (e) Regardless of any provision contained in any Note or in any of the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have contracted for or be entitled to receive, collect or apply as interest under any such Note or any Loan Document, or otherwise, any amount in excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law, and, in the event that the Administrative Agent receives, collects or applies as interest any such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of such Note, and, if the principal balance of such Note is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to the Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the highest lawful rate, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee, or premium, rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof, and (iii) spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of such Note so that the interest rate is uniform throughout such term; provided, that if all Obligations under the Notes and all Loan Documents are performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual term thereof exceeds the maximum lawful rate, the Administrative Agent shall refund to the Borrower the amount of such excess, or credit the amount of such excess against the aggregate unpaid principal balance of each of the Lenders' Notes on a pro rata basis based upon unpaid principal balances outstanding at the time in question.

Any payment received by the Administrative Agent later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

     (c) Notwithstanding the terms of of this Agreement, the Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent that any payment owed to such Lender is not paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent when due hereunder or under any other Loan Document, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.
Section 12.09
 
     (d) Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from the Borrower before the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower has not so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date on which such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

     (c) A Lender that becomes a Declining Lender shall not be considered a Swap Lender with respect to swap contracts entered into after it has become a Declining Lender. Accordingly, if a Swap Lender should enter into a Swap Contract with the Borrower after it has become a Declining Lender, the Borrower's obligations under such swap contract shall not be secured by the Collateral hereunder, and the Declining Lender shall not be entitled to any sharing of amounts pursuant to the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement with respect to such Swap Contracts entered into after it has become a Declining Lender.
     (d) Until all Declining Lenders are fully repaid, repayments (including realizations from Collateral) shall be applied as follows:
     (i) For purposes of allocating repayments prior to the occurrence of a Sharing Event under the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement, all repayments of Revolving Loans shall be allocated among the Lenders according to the Pro Rata Share of each Lender as such Pro Rata Share existed on the day such Revolving Loan was made and the Administrative Agent shall apply such payment in chronological order of outstanding Obligations, oldest Obligation being repaid first. Notwithstanding any other provision of this , in the event that a Letter of Credit is Issued hereunder prior to the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date and an L/C Advance is required to be made in respect of such Letter of Credit on or after the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date, each of the Declining Lenders who had originally purchased a participation in such Letter of Credit pursuant to of this Agreement shall be required to fund, on a pro rata basis based upon its percentage of participation in the related Letter of Credit, its portion of such L/C Advance notwithstanding that such L/C Advance is being made after the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date and this shall survive any Declining Lenders' termination of its obligations under this Agreement so as to require enforcement of this obligation as against any Declining Lender.

To cover payment of any such account payable prior to collection thereof, the Daylight Overdraft Bank may, in its sole discretion on an UNCOMMITTED AND ABSOLUTELY DISCRETIONARY basis, and without any obligation to do so, elect to make a Daylight Overdraft Loan by debiting the amount thereof to an account of the Borrower at the Daylight Overdraft Bank in which the Collateral Agent shall have been granted a security interest notwithstanding that sufficient collected funds are not available
 
in such account to cover such payment, provided that after giving effect to any Daylight Overdraft Loan requested:

     (iv) the Daylight Overdraft Loans may be used only (i) to refinance reimbursement obligations owed to any Letter of Credit Issuer after a Letter of Credit Issuer honors a payment under a Letter of Credit at settlement, and (ii) to finance payments to be made from the related deposit account of the Borrower held with the Administrative Agent, so long as the proceeds of Eligible Accounts Receivable covering the same are reasonably expected to be received on the day such Daylight Overdraft Loan is made.
     (b) THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE DAYLIGHT OVERDRAFT BANK HAS NO DUTY TO FUND ANY DAYLIGHT OVERDRAFT LOAN REQUESTED BY THE BORROWER BUT THAT THE DAYLIGHT OVERDRAFT BANK WILL EVALUATE EACH LOAN REQUEST AND IN ITS ABSOLUTE AND SOLE DISCRETION WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO FUND SUCH LOAN REQUEST.

     (i) Without any request therefor from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent may make a Swing Line Loan to the Borrower on behalf of the Swing Line Lender, the proceeds of which shall be applied to repay all or a portion of the unpaid amount of such Daylight Overdraft Loan. Upon making such Loan, the Administrative Agent will send notice thereof to the Borrower and the Swing Line Lender, whereupon the Swing Line Lender shall fund such Swing Line Loan without offset, deduction or counterclaim.
     (ii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that all or any portion of such Swing Line Loan may not be (A) legally made by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower for any other reason (including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Borrower), or (B) made by the Administrative Agent because any of the conditions precedent to the making
 
of a Loan pursuant to of this Agreement were not fulfilled as of the date such Swing Line Loan would otherwise have been made, each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased a participation interest in the unpaid amount of such Daylight Overdraft Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof and shall fund the amount of such participation interest to the Administrative Agent ON DEMAND. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received a Notice of Declining Lender from one or more Lenders one (1) Business Day prior to the Administrative Agent's receipt of any Borrowing Request (in which event the provisions of of this Agreement hereof shall be applicable), each Lender will immediately transfer to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation, and the proceeds of such participation shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Daylight Overdraft Bank, to such extent as will reduce the amount of the participating interest retained by the Daylight Overdraft Bank in its Daylight Overdraft Loans.
