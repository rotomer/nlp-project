This Current Report on Form 8-K/A Amendment No. 1 is being filed to correct the description of the default and financial covenants in the TPSA Credit Agreement in that certain Current Report on Form 8-K of Tesoro Corporation dated October 18, 2010 (filed October 22, 2010) (the "Current Report"). The original description gave the false impression that the covenants are with Tesoro Corporation. This 8-K/A clarifies that the covenants in the TPSA Credit Agreement apply to Tesoro Panama Company, S.A. and not Tesoro Corporation. The other disclosures in Item 1.01 of that Current Report are restated without revision.
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 18, 2010, Tesoro Panama Company, S.A. ("TPSA"), a directly and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesoro Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a uncommitted revolving credit agreement (the "TPSA Credit Agreement") with BNP Paribas, as Administrative and Syndicating Agent for the Lenders, together with its successors in such capacity (the "Administrative Agent") and BNP Paribas Securities Corp, as arranger. TPSA is an excluded and unrestricted subsidiary (as defined) from the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and outstanding indentures. The TPSA Credit Agreement is non-recourse to the Company, meaning that only TPSA is liable to reimburse BNP Paribas for any borrowed amounts or interest thereon. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, other than TPSA and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions), are guarantors under the TPSA Credit Agreement. This summary of the material terms of the TPSA Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the TPSA Credit Agreement, a copy of which is incorporated by reference herein.
The Company formed TPSA to further utilize its pipeline and tank facilities in Panama by enhancing strategic partnerships, developing economies of scale around freight and storage opportunities, expanding global commercial relationships and evaluating opportunities to source crude from alternative supply markets for trade or transportation.
The TPSA Credit Agreement will provide for (a) up to $260 million in an uncommitted, senior-secured revolving credit facility ("Facility A") available for revolving loans, swing line loans, daylight overdraft loans and the issuance on an uncommitted basis of letters of credit ("LCs") and (b) up to $150 million in an uncommitted, senior-secured facility ("Facility B") available for Trade LCs and advances. Facilities A and B are each available on an uncommitted basis subject to the applicable facility maximum amount and collateral pool (at closing the Combined Facility Maximum Amount was $350 million) ($245 million for Facility A and $105 million for Facility B).
The TPSA Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature which permits TPSA to increase the facilities up to $700 million provided that the Facilities A and B maximum amounts do not exceed $550 million and $350 million, respectively.
Facility A will be used for advances in connection with the purchase, storage and sale of Product and for related hedging and working capital requirements related to the normal course of business. Facility B will be used to finance TPSA's purchase of Product from suppliers through the issuance of LCs including escalation clauses and is available for advances in connection with the refinancing of Facility B LCs not refinanced under Facility A.
Under the TPSA Credit Agreement, each extension of credit will bear interest, at the following rates per annum:
The TPSA Credit Agreement contains the following default financial covenants as they relate to TPSA financial results:
