Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Reports Third Quarter Results; Announces Restart of Anacortes Refinery
SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 4, 2010--Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported third quarter 2010 net earnings of $56 million, or $0.39 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $33 million, or $0.24 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2009. The Company earned $73 million or $0.51 per diluted share for the period before one-time after-tax expenses of $17 million primarily associated with the Anacortes refinery outage.
Third quarter segment operating income was $201 million excluding the one-time items, compared to $137 million in the third quarter a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven by stronger distillate margins, improved feedstock cost and the Companys improvement initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by decreased gasoline margins and reduced throughput. The reduction in throughput was primarily a result of the continued shut-down of the Anacortes refinery and the planned turnaround of our Hawaii refinery.
For the third quarter, the Tesoro Index gained $1.42 per barrel (/bbl) or 17% from a year ago. West Coast benchmark diesel margins were up more than 50% over last year while gasoline margins were down 7%. The Company realized all of the index gains and more, capturing a gross margin of $13.28/bbl, which was up $3.69/bbl or 38% from a year ago.
Contributing to the Companys improved performance relative to the index was an increase in conversion unit utilization which resulted in higher clean product yields. In addition, the Company produced more diesel, capturing the stronger distillate margins and ran more Canadian and South American heavy crudes as the discounts for these crudes widened.
We are pleased with our third quarter results, even with Anacortes down for the period, said Greg Goff, President and CEO of Tesoro. During the quarter we saw improvement in distillate margins in our markets similar to whats been seen across the country. We attribute this to strong distillate exports, improvements in the U.S. manufacturing sector and increased port activity nationwide. Unfortunately, these increases are not being seen in gasoline margins. While gasoline demand has stabilized, high unemployment in California continues to keep gasoline demand weak.
Capital Spending and Liquidity
Capital spending, including turnarounds, for the third quarter 2010 was $110 million. The Company reaffirms prior full year 2010 guidance for capital spending, including turnarounds, to be in the range of $475 to $500 million. The Company ended the third quarter with $339 million in cash on the balance sheet, a gain of nearly $150 million for the quarter, and remained undrawn with $827 million of availability on its revolving credit facility.
While we have seen improvements in the market during the third quarter, we continue to plan for a challenging margin environment and are committed to our improvement initiatives. Our third quarter results benefited from the changes to corporate overhead and benefits costs we announced in July and we expect those improvements to continue. Were looking forward to our analyst day event later in the fourth quarter where well discuss our 2011 plans for further strengthening Tesoro, said Goff.
Washington Refinery
Tesoro also announced that the process to restart the Anacortes, Washington refinery began on October 17. "Today, most of the refinery is operating and we expect to be back to normal operations soon. In addition to completing repairs to the damaged units, extensive future inspections and maintenance work was accelerated to take advantage of the down time," said Goff.
th
The Company is also working with insurance adjusters to process claims related to the incident. Tesoro maintains comprehensive property, business interruption, workers compensation and general liability insurance.
On October 22, 2010, Tesoro filed a Notice of Appeal to all citations and penalties with the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. The Company continues to work closely with investigators regarding this incident and continues to drive safety improvements throughout the Company.
