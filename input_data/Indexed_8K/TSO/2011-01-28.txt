Amended and Restated Bylaws of Tesoro Corporation
On January 26, 2011, the Board of  Directors of Tesoro Corporation (the Board) approved amendments to and a restatement of the Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws (as amended, the Bylaws), which were effective immediately upon the adoption of such resolutions by our Board. The amendments update the following provisions of the Bylaws:
:  The Bylaws updated the Companys majority voting policy by providing that each director is to be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast, provided, however, that the directors will be elected by a plurality of votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) a stockholder has nominated a person in compliance with the advance notice requirements set forth, and (ii) such nomination was not withdrawn on or prior to the tenth day before the Company mails its notice of meeting to the stockholders.
Voting Standard for Election of Directors
 
:  The Bylaws were updated with respect to stockholder nominations for the election of directors.  As updated, in order for a stockholder to nominate a director or submit other certain business at a stockholder meeting, a stockholder must comply with the advance notice provisions, including, providing written notice of such nomination and other business in a timely manner. To be considered timely, the amendments generally provide that a stockholders notice must be delivered to the Companys Secretary not earlier than the close of business on the 120 day and not later than the close of business on the 90 day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting.  The revised advance notice provisions of the Bylaws also require updates as to the specific requirements of the stockholders notice to the Companys Secretary and to the stockholders disclosures regarding the stockholders ownership and voting interests in the Companys securities.

Conduct of Stockholder Meetings
 
:  The Bylaws were updated to set forth the procedures to be followed with respect to stockholder action by written consent, including the procedures for fixing a record date in order to determine the stockholders entitled to take such action.
Stockholder Action by Written Consent
 
:  The Bylaws were updated to clarify that the Chairman of the Board shall not be deemed to be an officer of the Company and set forth the duties of the Chairman of the Board and the procedures by which the Chairman of the Board may preside at all stockholder meetings.
