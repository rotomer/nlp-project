On March 16, 2011, Tesoro Corporation (the Company or Tesoro) amended and restated the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) dated May 11, 2007 (as amended, the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks and financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase Bank as administrative agent. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for total available revolving capacity of $1.85 billion and allows for the Company to request that the capacity be increased up to an aggregate of $2.25 billion, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lending group.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoros active domestic s ubsidiaries, excluding any entities related to Tesoro Logistics LP.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the petroleum inventory, cash and receivables of the Company's active domestic subsidiaries. Consistent with the Credit Agreement, borrowings available under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are up to the total available revolving capacity or the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base, consisting of Tesoros eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories as defined less a standard reserve of $50 million (subject to adjustment if the fixed charge coverage ratio is less than 1.0). 
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate, on March 16, 2016, unless the Company does not (a) refinance or pay in full, the Company's 6% notes due November 2012 on or prior to the stated maturity date, or (b) refinance or pay in full, the Company's 6% notes due November 2015 on or prior to the stated maturity date, at which point the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement would be immediately terminated.
Borrowings bear interest at either a base rate (3.25% at March 16, 2011) or a Eurodollar rate (0.25% at March 16, 2011 (1M LIBOR)), plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin at March 16, 2011, was 1.75% in the case of the Eurodollar rate but varies based upon revolver availability and credit ratings. The annual rate of commitment fees also varies based on credit ratings and ranges from 0.375% to 0.50%.  At March 16, 2011, the annual rate of commitment fees was 0.375%.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the Company's ability (as well as those of the Company's subsidiaries) to:
      pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock and purchase, redeem or retire our capital stock;
      incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;
      sell assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in our business;
      incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;
      engage in certain business activities;
      make certain payments and distributions from our subsidiaries;
      engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and
      enter into transactions with affiliates.
Tesoro is also required to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth.   The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is summary in nature and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and incorporated herein by reference.

Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 2.14.2 shall govern and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section 2.14.2, even if such provision declares that it controls.  As used in this Section 2.14.2, the term interest includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits, or other compensation which constitute interest under app licable law, that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the use, forbearance, or detention of money and not as interest and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged, or received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread, in equal parts during the full term of the Secured Obligations.  In no event shall the Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or any Holder of Secured Obligations have any right or privilege to reserve, receive, or retain, (i) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of nonusurious interest permitted under the laws of the State of New York or the applicable laws (if any) of the U.S. or of any other applicable state or (ii) total interest in excess of the amount which such Holder of Secured Obligations could lawfully have contracted for, res erved, received, retained, or charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of the Secured Obligations at the Highest Lawful Rate.  On each day, if any, that the interest rate (the ) called for under this Agreement or any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence.  Thereafter, interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest a ccrual rate.  The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest Lawful Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is being made.  None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this Section 2.14.2, or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance, or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the term of any Secured Obligation is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Holder of Secured Obligations at any time, including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or has received) in terest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment, or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to such Holder of Secured Obligations, it shall be credited against the then outstanding principal balance of the Borrowers obligations to such Holder of Secured Obligations, effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.  Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit accounts (formerly Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. Art. 5069, Ch. 15)) shall not apply to this Agreement or to any Loan, nor shall this Agreement or any Loan be governed by or be subject to the provisions of such Chapter 346 in any manner whatsoever.
