The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending this Agreement; , , that any amendment that would result in the delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is then listed or admitted to trading must be approved, prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class.

TESORO LOGISTICS GP, LLC, THE GENERAL PARTNER OF TESORO LOGISTICS LP, MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF TESORO LOGISTICS LP BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE FACILITIES OF ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING.
 
Section 4.9
Eligibility Certificates; Ineligible Holders.
          (a) If at any time the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that
     (i) the Partnership's status other than as an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the failure of the Partnership otherwise to be subject to an entity-level tax for U.S. federal, state or local income tax purposes, coupled with the tax status (or lack of proof of the federal income tax status) of one or more Limited Partners, has or will reasonably likely have a material adverse effect on the maximum applicable rate that can be charged to customers by Subsidiaries of the Partnership (a ""); or
Rate Eligibility Trigger

Citizenship Eligibility Trigger
then, the General Partner may adopt such amendments to this Agreement as it determines to be necessary or advisable to (x) in the case of a Rate Eligibility Trigger, obtain such proof of the federal income tax status of the Limited Partners and, to the extent relevant, their beneficial owners, as the General Partner determines to be necessary or advisable to establish those Limited Partners whose federal income tax status does not or would not have a material adverse effect on the maximum applicable rate that can be charged to customers by Subsidiaries of the Partnership or (y) in the case of a Citizenship Eligibility Trigger, obtain such proof of the nationality, citizenship or other related status (or, if the General Partner is a nominee holding for the account of another Person, the nationality, citizenship or other related status of such Person) of the Limited Partner as the General Partner determines to be necessary or advisable to establish and those Limited Partners whose status as a Limited Partner does not or would not subject any Group Member to a significant risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of its properties or interests therein.
          (b) Such amendments may include provisions requiring all Limited Partners to certify as to their (and their beneficial owners') status as Eligible Holders upon demand and on a regular basis, as determined by the General Partner, and may require transferees of Units to so certify prior to being admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner (any such required certificate, an "").
Eligibility Certificate
          (c) Such amendments may provide that with respect to any Limited Partner (and its beneficial owners) who fails to furnish to the General Partner within a reasonable period requested an Eligibility Certificate and any other information, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or other requested information the General Partner determines that a Limited Partner is not an Eligible Holder (such a Limited Partner an ""), the Limited Partner Interests owned by such Limited Partner shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.10.

          (d) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Ineligible Holders, distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Limited Partners (including the General Partner and its Affiliates) in respect of Limited Partner Interests other than those of Ineligible Holders are cast, either for, against or abstaining as to the matter.
          (e) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, an Ineligible Holder shall have no right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide cash in exchange for an assignment of the Ineligible Holder's share of any distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Ineligible Holder of its Limited Partner Interest (representing the right to receive its share of such distribution in kind).
          (f) At any time after a holder can and does certify that it has become an Eligible Holder, an Ineligible Holder may, upon application to the General Partner, request that with respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such Ineligible Holder not redeemed pursuant to Section 4.10, such Ineligible Holder upon approval of the General Partner, shall no longer constitute an Ineligible Holder and the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect of such Limited Partner Interests.
Section 4.10
Redemption of Partnership Interests of Ineligible Holders.
          (a) If at any time a Limited Partner fails to furnish an Eligibility Certificate or any other information requested within a reasonable period of time specified in amendments adopted pursuant to Section 4.9, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or other information the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner is an Ineligible Holder, the Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such Limited Partner is not an Ineligible Holder or has transferred his Limited Partner Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Holder and who furnishes an Eligibility Certificate to the General Partner prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Limited Partner Interest of such Limited Partner as follows:

The notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon redemption of the Redeemable Interests (or, if later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests) and that on and after the date fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or be made.
 
     (ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption price shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 5% annually and payable in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.
     (iii) The Limited Partner or his duly authorized representative shall be entitled to receive the payment for the Redeemable Interests at the place of payment specified in the notice of redemption on the redemption date (or, if later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or Transferee at the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank).
     (iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.
          (b) The provisions of this Section 4.10 shall also be applicable to Limited Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner as nominee of a Person determined to be other than an Eligible Holder.
          (c) Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw the notice of redemption, the transferee of such Limited Partner Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner that he is an Eligible Holder. If the transferee fails to make such certification, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the original redemption date.

The initial Capital Account balance attributable to the General Partner Units issued to the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.2(a) shall equal the Net Agreed Value of the Capital Contribution specified in Section 5.2(a), which shall be deemed to equal the product of the number of General Partner Units issued to the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.2(a) and the Initial Unit Price for each Common Unit (and the initial Capital Account balance attributable to each General Partner Unit shall equal the Initial Unit Price for each Common Unit). The initial Capital Account balance attributable to the Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to each of Tesoro, Tesoro R&M and Tesoro Alaska, respectively, pursuant to Section 5.3(a) shall equal the respective Net Agreed Value of the Capital Contributions specified in Section 5.3(a), which shall be deemed to equal the product of the number of Common Units and Subordinated Units issued to each of Tesoro, Tesoro R&M and Tesoro Alaska, respectively, pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and the Initial Unit Price for each such Common Unit and Subordinated Unit (and the initial Capital Account balance attributable to each such Common Unit and Subordinated Unit shall equal its Initial Unit Price).

The initial Capital Account attributable to the Incentive Distribution Rights shall be zero. Thereafter, the Capital Account shall in respect of each such Partnership Interest be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1.
          (b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction that is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be reflected in the Partners' Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose), , that:
provided
     (i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.5, the Partnership shall be treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the General Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member Agreement or governing, organizational or similar documents) of all property owned by (x) any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and (y) any other partnership, limited liability company, unincorporated business or other entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes of which a Group Member is, directly or indirectly, a partner, member or other equity holder.
     (ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1.
     (iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the Partnership. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.
 
     (iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the Partnership's Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.
     (v) An item of income of the Partnership that is described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) of the Code (with respect to items of income that are exempt from tax) shall be treated as an item of income for the purpose of this Section 5.5(b), and an item of expense of the Partnership that is described in Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code (with respect to expenditures that are not deductible and not chargeable to capital accounts), shall be treated as an item of deduction for the purpose of this Section 5.5(b).
     (vi) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.5(d) to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation, cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be determined under the rules prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d)(2) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment.
     (vii) The Gross Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such times as provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to Carrying Values. The amount of any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item of loss (if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership).
          (c) (i) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest so transferred.
     (ii) Subject to Section 6.7(c), immediately prior to the transfer of a Subordinated Unit or of a Subordinated Unit that has converted into a Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.7 by a holder thereof (other than a transfer to an Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this subparagraph 5.5(c)(ii) apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated Units will (A) first, be allocated to the Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated Units to be transferred in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor, regardless of whether it has
 
retained any Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated Units (""). Following any such allocation, the transferor's Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained Subordinated Units or Retained Converted Subordinated Units, if any, will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (B) hereinabove, and the transferee's Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (A) hereinabove.
Retained Converted Subordinated Units
          (d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of services, or the conversion of the General Partner's Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Capital Account of each Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, and any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such issuance and had been allocated among the Partners at such time pursuant to Section 6.1(c) and Section 6.1(d) in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated; , that in the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of cash or Contributed Property, or in the event of an issuance of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such adjustments are unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt. In making its determination of the fair market values of individual properties, the General Partner may determine that it is appropriate to first determine an aggregate value for the Partnership, derived from the current trading price of the Common Units, and taking fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time, and then allocate such aggregate value among the individual properties of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines appropriate).
provided, however
     (ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property(other than a distribution of cash that is not in redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, and any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been allocated among the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 6.1(c)and Section 6.1(d) in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized
 
following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual distribution that is not made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a deemed distribution, be determined in the same manner as that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined by the Liquidator using such method of valuation as it may adopt.
Section 5.6 .

Splits and Combinations
          (a) Subject to Section 5.9(d), Section 6.6 and Section 6.9 (dealing with adjustments of distribution levels), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis (including any Common Unit Arrearage or Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage) or stated as a number of Units are proportionately adjusted.
          (b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.
          (c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates or uncertificated Partnership Securities to the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of
 
Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes.

          (d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units. If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for the provisions of Section 5.6(d) and this Section 5.9(d), each fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (with fractional Units equal to or greater than a 0.5 Unit being rounded to the next higher Unit).

     (A) At the election of the General Partner with respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the termination of the Subordination Period, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period, after taking into account allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii), shall be allocated 100% to each Partner holding Subordinated Units that are Outstanding as of the termination of the Subordination Period ("") in the proportion of the number of Final Subordinated Units held by such Partner to the total number of Final Subordinated Units then Outstanding, until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Final Subordinated Units to an amount that after taking into account the other allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction to be made with respect to such taxable period will equal the product of (A) the number of Final Subordinated Units held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit. The purpose of this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying Final Subordinated Units and the Capital Accounts underlying Common Units held by Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates immediately prior to the conversion of such Final Subordinated Units into Common Units. This allocation method for establishing such economic uniformity will be available to the General Partner only if the method for allocating the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Subordinated Units between the transferred and retained Subordinated Units pursuant to Section 5.5(c)(ii) does not otherwise provide such economic uniformity to the Final Subordinated Units.
Final Subordinated Units
     (B) With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership property pursuant to Section 5.5(d) during any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or after, the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units pursuant to Section 5.11, after the application of Section 6.1(d)(x)(A), any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner that to the nearest extent possible results in the Capital Accounts maintained with respect to such IDR Reset Common Units issued pursuant to Section 5.11 equaling the product of (A) the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit.
     (C) With respect to any taxable period during which an IDR Reset Common Unit is transferred to any Person who is not an Affiliate of the transferor, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the transferor Partner of such transferred IDR Reset Common Unit until such transferor Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such transferred IDR Reset Common Unit to an amount equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit
 
     (D) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.1(d)(x)(D) only if such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code.
     (xi) .
Curative Allocation
     (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together, shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain and (2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. In exercising its discretion under this Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A), the General Partner may take into account future Required Allocations that, although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required Allocations previously made. Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners. Further, allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A) shall be deferred with respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent Required Allocations.
     (B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to
 
Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions.
     (xii) . In the event of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items or any Book-Down Event or any recognition of a Net Termination Loss, the following rules shall apply:
Corrective and Other Allocations
     (A) Except as provided in Section 6.1(d)(xii)(B), in the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (other than an allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under Section 5.5(d) hereof), the General Partner shall allocate such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to (1) the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights and the General Partner to the same extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to them pursuant to Section 5.5(d) and (2) all Unitholders, Pro Rata, to the extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to any Unitholders pursuant to Section 5.5(d).
     (B) In the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (other than an allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under Section 5.5(d) hereof or an allocation of Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof) as a result of a sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset that is an Adjusted Property ("Disposed of Adjusted Property"), the General Partner shall allocate (1) additional items of gross income and gain (aa) away from the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights and (bb) to the Unitholders, or (2) additional items of deduction and loss (aa) away from the Unitholders and (bb) to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights, to the extent that the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items allocated to the Unitholders exceed their Share of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items with respect to such Disposed of Adjusted Property. Any allocation made pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(xii)(B) shall be made after all of the other Agreed Allocations have been made as if this Section 6.1(d)(xii) were not in this Agreement and, to the extent necessary, shall require the reallocation of items that have been allocated pursuant to such other Agreed Allocations.
     (C) In the case of any negative adjustments to the Capital Accounts of the Partners resulting from a Book-Down Event or from the recognition of a Net Termination Loss, such negative adjustment (1) shall first be allocated, to the extent of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments, in such a manner, as determined by the General Partner, that to the extent possible the aggregate Capital Accounts of the Partners will equal the amount that would have been the Capital Account balances of the Partners if no prior Book-Up Events had occurred, and (2) any negative adjustment in excess of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments shall be allocated pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof.
      (D) For purposes of this Section 6.1(d)(xii), the Unitholders shall be treated as being allocated Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to the extent
 
that such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items have reduced the amount of income that would otherwise have been allocated to the Unitholders under this Agreement. In making the allocations required under this Section 6.1(d)(xii), the General Partner may apply whatever conventions or other methodology it determines will satisfy the purpose of this Section 6.1(d)(xii). Without limiting the foregoing, if an Adjusted Property is contributed by the Partnership to another entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes (the "lower tier partnership"), the General Partner may make allocations similar to those described in Sections 6.1(d)(xii)(A)(C) to the extent the General Partner determines such allocations are necessary to account for the Partnership's allocable share of income, gain, loss and deduction of the lower tier partnership that relate to the contributed Adjusted Property in a manner that is consistent with the purpose of this Section 6.1(d)(xii).
     (xiii) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1 (other than the Required Allocations), if the Liquidation Date occurs prior to the conversion of the last Outstanding Subordinated Unit, then items of income, gain, loss and deduction for the taxable period that includes the Liquidation Date (and, if necessary, items arising in previous taxable periods to the extent the General Partner determines such items may be so allocated), shall be specially allocated among the Partners in the manner determined appropriate by the General Partner so as to cause, to the maximum extent possible, the Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit to equal the amount such Capital Account would have been if all prior allocations of Net Termination Gain and Net Termination Loss had been made pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i) or Section 6.1(c)(ii), as applicable.
Special Curative Allocation in Event of Liquidation Prior to End of Subordination Period
Section 6.2 .
Allocations for Tax Purposes
          (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.
          (b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined appropriate by the General Partner (taking into account the General Partner's discretion under Section 6.1(d)(x)(D)); provided, that the General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in all events.
          (c) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied to the
 
unamortized Book-Tax Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnership's property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as such conventions would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests.
          (d) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and 1.1250-1(f), any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.
          (e) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the Partnership; , , that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.
provided
however
          (f) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction, for federal income tax purposes, shall be determined for each taxable period and prorated on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of each month; , , such items for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the month in which the last Option Closing Date or the expiration of the Over-Allotment Option occurs shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of the next succeeding month; and , , that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of any assets of the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income or loss realized and recognized other than in the ordinary course of business, as determined by the General Partner, shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of the month in which such gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

The Record Date for the first distribution of Available Cash shall not be prior to the final closing of the Over-Allotment Option. All amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source shall be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of Available Cash theretofore distributed by the Partnership to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.4 equals the Operating Surplus from the Closing Date through the close of the immediately preceding Quarter.

None of
 
any Group Member, any Limited Partner or any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, or the partnership relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any Unrestricted Person.
          (c) Subject to the terms of Sections 7.5(a) and (b), but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging in competitive activities by any Unrestricted Person (other than the General Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5 is hereby approved by the Partnership and all Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed not to be a breach of any fiduciary duty or any other obligation of any type whatsoever of the General Partner or any other Unrestricted Person for the Unrestricted Persons (other than the General Partner) to engage in such business interests and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the Partnership and (iii) the Unrestricted Persons shall have no obligation hereunder or as a result of any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, to present business opportunities to the Partnership.

Except as provided in the Omnibus Agreement, no Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership, shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Partnership, and such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) shall not be liable to the Partnership, to any Limited Partner or any other Person bound by this Agreement for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) pursues or acquires for itself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not communicate such opportunity or information to the Partnership; provided such Unrestricted Person does not engage in such business or activity as a result of or using confidential or proprietary information provided by or on behalf of the Partnership to such Unrestricted Person.

The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection with the borrowing of such funds.

No Group Member may lend funds to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other than another Group Member).

Section 7.7 .
Indemnification
          (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all threatened, pending or completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and including appeals, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee and acting (or refraining to act) in such capacity on behalf of or for the benefit of the Partnership; provided, that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless pursuant to this Agreement if there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful; provided, further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be available to any Affiliate of the General Partner (other than a Group Member), or to any other Indemnitee, with respect to any such Affiliate's obligations pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.
          (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section 7.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
 
upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized by this Section 7.7.
          (c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee's capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity (including any capacity under the Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee.
          (d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the Partnership's activities or such Person's activities on behalf of the Partnership, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.
          (e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership.

          (g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
          (h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.
          (i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims
 
arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.
Section 7.8 .
Liability of Indemnitees
          (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, or any other Persons who have acquired interests in the Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee's conduct was criminal.
          (b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in Section 7.1(a), the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith.
          (c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnership's business or affairs shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.
          (d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.
Section 7.9 .
Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and Modification of Duties
          (a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, any Group Member or any Partner, on the other, any resolution or course of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii) approved by the vote of a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates), (iii) on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated
 
third parties or (iv) fair and reasonable to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with its resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval or Unitholder approval of such resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder approval. If Special Approval is sought, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Conflicts Committee acted in good faith, and if neither Special Approval nor Unitholder approval is sought and the Board of Directors of the General Partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board of Directors of the General Partner acted in good faith, and in either case, in any proceeding brought by any Limited Partner or by or on behalf of such Limited Partner or any other Limited Partner or the Partnership challenging such approval, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of overcoming such presumption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or equity, the existence of the conflicts of interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby approved by all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.
          (b) Whenever the General Partner or the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof (including the Conflicts Committee), makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any Affiliate of the General Partner causes the General Partner to do so, in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership as opposed to in its individual capacity, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then, unless another express standard is provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner, the Board of Directors or such committee or such Affiliates causing the General Partner to do so, shall make such determination or take or decline to take such other action in good faith and shall not be subject to any other or different standards (including fiduciary standards) imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. In order for a determination or other action to be in "good faith" for purposes of this Agreement, the Person or Persons making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action must believe that the determination or other action is in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership Group.
          (c) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any fiduciary duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, and the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. By way of illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrase, "at the option of the General Partner," or
 
some variation of that phrase, is used in this Agreement, it indicates that the General Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its Partnership Interests, or refrains from voting or transferring its Partnership Interests, it shall be acting in its individual capacity.
          (d) The General Partner's organizational documents may provide that determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if the General Partner is a limited liability company, stockholders, if the General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the General Partner's general partner, if the General Partner is a partnership.
          (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General Partner and its Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation, express or implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be at its option.
          (f) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or required by the Delaware Act, neither the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to the Partnership or any Limited Partner and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, of the General Partner or any other Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of the General Partner or such other Indemnitee.
          (g) The Unitholders hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve actions by the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar to those actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 7.9.
Section 7.10 .
Other Matters Concerning the General Partner
          (a) The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
          (b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the advice or opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such Person's professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
 
          (c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys- in- fact or the duly authorized officers of the Partnership or any Group Member.
Section 7.11 .
Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities
     The General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership Securities; , except as permitted pursuant to Section 4.10, the General Partner may not cause any Group Member to purchase Subordinated Units during the Subordination Period. As long as Partnership Securities are held by any Group Member, such Partnership Securities shall not be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Securities for its own account, subject to the provisions of Articles IV and X.

In connection with any registration pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.12(a), the Partnership shall (i) promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the securities subject to such registration under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request; , , that no such

provided
Section 12.3 .
Liquidator
     Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2, the General Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units voting as a single class. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days' prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units voting as a single class. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units voting as a single class. The right to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this Article XII, the Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in Section 7.3) necessary or appropriate to
 
carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein.
Section 12.4 .
Liquidation
     The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the Liquidator, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:
          (a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c) to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnership's assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may distribute the Partnership's assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners.
          (b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of Section 12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution rights under Article VI. With respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as additional liquidation proceeds.
          (c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in Section 12.4(b) shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this Section 12.4(c)) for the taxable period of the Partnership during which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable period (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence).
Section 12.5 .
Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership
     Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the Partnership, the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.
 
Section 12.6 .
Return of Contributions
     The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.
Section 12.7 .
Waiver of Partition
To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property.
Section 12.8 .
Capital Account Restoration
     No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its interest in the Partnership by the end of the taxable year of the Partnership during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the date of such liquidation.

          (d) a change that the General Partner determines, (i) does not adversely affect the Limited Partners (including any particular class of Partnership Interests as compared to other classes of Partnership Interests) in any material respect, (ii) to be necessary or appropriate to (A) satisfy any requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation of any federal or state agency or judicial authority or contained in any federal

          (g) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the authorization or issuance of any class or series of Partnership Securities pursuant to Section 5.6;
          (h) any amendment expressly permitted in this Agreement to be made by the General Partner acting alone;
          (i) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a Merger Agreement approved in accordance with Section 14.3;
          (j) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect and account for the formation by the Partnership of, or investment by the Partnership in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity, in connection with the conduct by the Partnership of activities permitted by the terms of Section 2.4;
          (k) a merger, conveyance or conversion pursuant to Section 14.3(d); or

Section 13.5 .
Notice of a Meeting

regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities Exchange or U.S. federal securities laws shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the date by which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General Partner to give such approvals.

Section 13.8 .
Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting
     The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting.
Section 13.9 .
Quorum and Voting
     The holders of a majority of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner) represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the Outstanding Units entitled to vote and be present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is required with respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent at least such greater or different percentage shall be required. The Limited Partners present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is
 
present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage of Outstanding Units specified in this Agreement (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner). In the absence of a quorum any meeting of Limited Partners may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units entitled to vote at such meeting (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner) that are represented at such meeting either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in Section 13.7.
Section 13.10 .
Conduct of a Meeting
     The General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning the manner of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of Section 13.4, the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies and the determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection with or during the meeting or voting. The General Partner shall designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner. The General Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals in writing.
Section 13.11 .
Action Without a Meeting
     If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting if an approval in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding Units (including Units deemed owned by the General Partner) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless such provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify that any written ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Units held by the Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals are deposited with
 
the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners' limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners.
Section 13.2 .
Right to Vote and Related Matters
          (a) Only those Record Holders of the Outstanding Units on the Record Date set pursuant to Section 13.6 (and also subject to the limitations contained in the definition of "Outstanding") shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units.
          (b) With respect to Units that are held for a Person's account by another Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units are registered, such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.

Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Revolving Credit Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

If the Partnership submits such a proposal to Tesoro, Tesoro agrees that it will negotiate in good faith with the Partnership to determine if the Administrative Fee for that year should be reduced and, if so, the amount of such reduction. If the Parties agree that the Administrative Fee for that year should be reduced, then Tesoro shall promptly pay to the Partnership the amount of any reduction for that year.

1. Anchorage #1 Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline and diesel releases from previously buried pipelines. The site is considered characterized and is currently undergoing removal of product from the water table, groundwater treatment, and long-term monitoring.
2. Anchorage #2 Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. The site is considered characterized and is currently undergoing groundwater monitoring and treatment. Off-site groundwater investigations are scheduled for 2012.
3. Stockton Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline and diesel releases from pipelines and/or product storage tanks. The site is considered substantially characterized and is undergoing groundwater treatment and groundwater monitoring. Off-site groundwater impacts are commingled with neighboring petroleum storage terminals.
4. Burley Terminal groundwater was impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. Groundwater impacts were commingled with neighboring petroleum storage terminals. Hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater samples do not exceed previously established target levels for groundwater and surface water protection. Regulatory closure is pending.
5. Wilmington Sales Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. Groundwater investigation and monitoring is on-going. Tesoro is indemnified by the previous owner for Investigation and remediation obligations.
6. Salt Lake City Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline and diesel releases from pipelines and/or product storage tanks occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. The site is considered characterized and is currently undergoing removal of product from the water table and long-term monitoring. There are no known soil or groundwater impacts at the Northwest Crude Oil tank farm.
7. The Stockton Terminal emits volatile organic compounds (VOCs) below "major source" emission criteria. In 2010, the San Joaquin Air Quality Management District announced it is reducing its major source threshold. When the Stockton Terminal expands its operations or increases throughput, the potential to emit VOC will increase and the Stockton terminal will become subject to regulation as a major source. This will require a Title V Air Operating Permit. In addition, the Stockton facility will be required to install an automated continuous emission monitor at a cost of approximately $75,000.

If TRMC does not exercise its Transportation Right of First Refusal in the manner set forth above, TLO may, for the next ninety (90) days, proceed with the negotiation of the third-party transportation services agreement. If no third party agreement is consummated during such ninety-day period, the terms and conditions of this Section 11(d) shall again become effective.
First Offer Period
Transportation Right of First Refusal
     (e) Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, TRMC shall promptly remove all of its crude petroleum and refined petroleum products from the Short Haul Pipelines within thirty (30) days of such termination or expiration.
12. FORCE MAJEURE
     (a) As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure, TLO shall provide TRMC with written notice of the occurrence of such Force Majeure (a ""). TLO shall identify in such Force Majeure Notice the particular Segment or Segments of the Short Haul Pipelines that are affected by the Force Majeure and the approximate length of time that TLO reasonably believes in good faith such Force Majeure shall continue (the ""). If TLO advises in any Force Majeure Notice that it reasonably believes in good faith that the Force Majeure Period shall continue for more than twelve (12) consecutive Months, then, subject to Section 13 below, at any time after TLO delivers such Force Majeure Notice, either Party may terminate that portion of this Agreement relating to the affected Segment, but only upon delivery to the other Party of a notice (a "") at least twelve (12) Months prior to the expiration of the Force Majeure Period; provided, however, that such Termination Notice shall be deemed cancelled and of no effect if the Force Majeure ends prior to the expiration of such twelve (12)-Month period. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Party may exercise its right under this Section 12(a) to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure with respect to any machinery, storage, tanks, lines of pipe or other equipment that has been unaffected by, or has been restored to working order since, the applicable Force Majeure, including pursuant to a Restoration under Section 13.
Force Majeure Notice
Force Majeure Period
Termination Notice
     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if TRMC delivers a Termination Notice to TLO (the "") and, within thirty (30) days after receiving such TRMC Termination Notice, TLO notifies TRMC that TLO reasonably believes in good faith that it shall be capable of fully performing its obligations under this Agreement within a reasonable period of time, then the TRMC Termination Notice shall be deemed revoked and the applicable portion of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such TRMC Termination Notice had never been given.
TRMC Termination Notice
     (c) Subject to Section 13 below, TLO's obligations may be temporarily suspended during the occurrence of, and for the entire duration of, a Force Majeure that prevents TLO from shipping the Minimum Throughput Commitment. If, for reasons of Force Majeure, TLO is prevented from shipping volumes equal to the full Minimum Throughput Commitment, then TRMC's obligation to ship the Minimum Throughput Commitment and pay the Shortfall Payment shall be reduced to the extent that TLO is prevented from shipping the full Minimum Throughput Commitment. At such time as TLO is capable of shipping volumes equal to the Minimum Throughput Commitment, TRMC's obligation to ship the full Minimum Throughput Commitment shall be restored. In addition, if TRMC is prevented from receiving crude petroleum from the Crude Pipelines as a result of a Force Majeure event affecting the
 
Storage Facility or other facilities owned by TLO, its obligation to ship the Minimum Throughput Commitment shall be reduced accordingly. TLO agrees that it shall declare a Force Majeure if TLO is prevented from shipping volumes equal to the full Minimum Throughput Commitment due to the inability of any pipeline connecting to the Short Haul Pipelines to supply or accept crude petroleum or refined petroleum products, as applicable.
13. CAPABILITIES OF SHORT HAUL PIPELINES
     (a)  TLO shall use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the interruption of service on the Short Haul Pipelines and any Segment thereof. TLO shall promptly inform TRMC of any anticipated partial or complete interruption of service which is projected to extend more than twenty-four (24) hours on any part of the Short Haul Pipelines affecting TLO's ability to receive or deliver crude petroleum or refined petroleum products on any Segment of the Short Haul Pipelines, including relevant information about the nature, extent, cause and expected duration of the interruption and the actions TLO is taking to resume full operations, provided that TLO shall not have any liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, TRMC of any such matters except to the extent TRMC has been materially prejudiced or damaged by such failure or delay.
Interruptions of Service.
     (b) 
Maintenance and Repair Standards.
     (i) Subject to Force Majeure, interruptions for routine repair and maintenance consistent with customary crude petroleum and refined petroleum products pipeline standards, and any applicable regulatory requirements, TLO shall accept for shipment on the Short Haul Pipelines in accordance with pipeline industry standards all crude petroleum and refined petroleum products that TRMC requests TLO to transport. Further, TLO shall maintain and repair all portions of the Short Haul Pipelines in accordance with pipeline industry standards and in a manner which allows the Short Haul Pipelines to be capable, subject to Force Majeure, of shipping, storing and delivering volumes of crude petroleum and refined petroleum products which are no less than the Minimum Throughput Capacity.
     (ii) If for any reason, including without limitation a Force Majeure event, the throughput capacity of any Segment of the Short Haul Pipelines should fall below the Minimum Throughput Capacity, then (A) during such period of reduced throughput capacity, TRMC's obligation to ship the Minimum Throughput Commitment and pay the Shortfall Payment shall be reduced as described in Section 12(c) above and (B) within a reasonable period of time after the commencement of such reduction, TLO shall make repairs to and/or replace the affected portion of the Short Haul Pipelines to restore the capacity of each Segment to the required Minimum Throughput Capacity (""). Except as provided below in Sections 13(c) and 13(d), all such Restoration shall be at TLO's cost and expense unless the damage creating the need for such repairs was caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of TRMC, its employees, agents or customers.
Restoration
     (iii) Notwithstanding the above provisions, except pursuant to a Capacity Expansion requested by TRMC, TLO shall not be required to install any additional pumping capacity or other improvements on the Crude Pipelines to facilitate shipment of a heavier grade of crude petroleum than has historically been shipped to the Storage Facility for use in the SLC Refinery. Upon request by TRMC for upgraded capacity for shipment of heavier crude petroleum grades in connection with a Restoration, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith arrangements whereby TLO will install suitable upgrades to the Crude Pipelines, consistent with Applicable Law, accepted pipeline design and operating procedures that will allow shipment of volumes of such heavier crude petroleum commensurate with historical volumes of lighter crude petroleum
 
shipments, with TRMC to reimburse TLO for associated capital costs and increased operating costs, as otherwise provided herein.
     (c) . In the event of the failure of TLO to maintain any Segment of the Short Haul Pipelines at its Minimum Throughput Capacity, then either Party shall have the right to call a meeting between executives of both Parties by providing at least two (2) Business Days' advance written notice. Any such meeting shall be held at a mutually agreeable location and will be attended by executives of both Parties each having sufficient authority to commit his or her respective Party to a Capacity Resolution (hereinafter defined). At the meeting, the Parties will negotiate in good faith with the objective of reaching a joint resolution for the Restoration of capacity on the affected portion of the Short Haul Pipelines which will, among other things, specify steps to be taken by TLO to fully accomplish Restoration and the deadlines by which the Restoration must be completed (the ""). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Capacity Resolution shall set forth an agreed upon time schedule for the Restoration activities. Such time schedule shall be reasonable under the circumstances, consistent with customary pipeline transportation industry standards and shall take into consideration TLO's economic considerations relating to costs of the repairs and TRMC's requirements concerning the operation of the SLC Refinery. In the event that TRMC's economic considerations justify incurring additional costs to restore the Short Haul Pipelines in a more expedited manner than the time schedule determined in accordance with the preceding sentence, TRMC may require TLO to expedite the Restoration to the extent reasonably possible, subject to TRMC's payment, in advance, of the estimated incremental costs to be incurred as a result of the expedited time schedule. In the event the Parties agree to an expedited Restoration plan wherein TRMC agrees to fund a portion of the Restoration cost, then neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12(a) above so long as such Restoration is completed with due diligence, and TRMC shall pay such portion to TLO in advance based on an estimate conforming to reasonable engineering standards applicable to petroleum or products pipelines, as applicable. Upon completion, TRMC shall pay the difference between the actual portion of Restoration costs to be paid by TRMC pursuant to this Section 13(c) and the estimated amount paid under the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after receipt of TLO's invoice therefor, or, if appropriate, TLO shall pay TRMC the excess of the estimate paid by TRMC over TLO's actual costs as previously described within thirty (30) days after completion of the Restoration.
Capacity Resolution
Capacity Resolution
     (d) . If at any time after the occurrence of (x) a Partnership Change of Control or (y) a sale of the SLC Refinery, TLO either (i) refuses or fails to meet with TRMC within the period set forth in Section 13(c), (ii) fails to agree to perform a Capacity Resolution in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 13(c) or (iii) fails to perform its obligations in compliance with the terms of a Capacity Resolution, TRMC may, as its sole remedy for any breach by TLO of any of its obligations under Section 13(c), require TLO to complete a Restoration of the affected portions of the Short Haul Pipelines. Any such Restoration required under this Section 13(d) shall be completed by TLO at TRMC's cost. TLO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide transportation of crude petroleum and refined petroleum products tendered by TRMC while such Restoration is being completed. Any work performed by TLO pursuant to this Section shall be performed and completed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable pipeline industry standards and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and/or regulations. Additionally, during such period after the occurrence of (x) a Partnership Change of Control or (y) a sale of the SLC Refinery, TRMC may exercise any remedies available to it under this Agreement (other than termination), including the right to immediately seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief for specific performance by TLO of the applicable provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to make Restorations described herein.
TRMC's Right To Cure
14. SUSPENSION OF SLC REFINERY OPERATIONS
 
     (a) In the event that TRMC decides to permanently or indefinitely suspend refining operations at the SLC Refinery for a period that shall continue for at least twelve (12) consecutive Months, TRMC may provide written notice to TLO of TRMC's intent to terminate this Agreement (the ""). Such Suspension Notice shall be sent at any time after TRMC has publicly announced such suspension and, upon the expiration of the twelve (12) Month period following the date such notice is sent (the ""), this Agreement shall terminate. If TRMC publicly announces, more than two Months prior to the expiration of the Notice Period, its intent to resume operations at the SLC Refinery, then the Suspension Notice shall be deemed revoked and the applicable portion of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such Suspension Notice had never been delivered.
Suspension Notice
Notice Period
     (b) If refining operations at the SLC Refinery are suspended for any reason (including refinery turnaround operations and other scheduled maintenance), then TRMC shall remain liable for Shortfall Payments under this Agreement for the duration of the suspension, unless and until this Agreement is terminated as provided above. TRMC shall provide at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of any suspension of operations at the SLC Refinery due to a planned turnaround or scheduled maintenance. Shortfall Payments due for each Month during which TRMC does not ship any volumes on the Short Haul Pipelines will be equal to (i) the Minimum Throughput Commitment multiplied by (ii) the Transportation Fee.
15. INDEMNITIES
     (a) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, TLO shall release, defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless TRMC from and against any and all demands, claims (including third-party claims), losses, costs, suits, or causes of action (including, but not limited to, any judgments, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, expenses, interest, reasonable legal fees, costs of suit, and damages, whether in law or equity and whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) for or relating to (i) personal or bodily injury to, or death of the employees of TRMC and, as applicable, its customers, representatives, and agents; (ii) loss of or damage to any property, products, material, and/or equipment belonging to TRMC and, as applicable, its customers, representatives, and agents, and each of their respective affiliates, contractors, and subcontractors (except for those volume losses provided for in Section 7); (iii) loss of or damage to any other property, products, material, and/or equipment of any other description (except for those volume losses provided for in Section 7), and/or personal or bodily injury to, or death of any other person or persons; and with respect to clauses (i) through (iii) above, which is caused by or resulting in whole or in part from the acts and omissions of TLO in connection with the ownership or operation of the Short Haul Pipelines and the services provided hereunder, and, as applicable, its carriers, customers (other than TRMC), representatives, and agents, or those of their respective employees with respect to such matters; and (iv) any losses incurred by TRMC due to violations of this Agreement by TLO, or, as applicable, its customers (other than TRMC), representatives, and agents;

5. STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION FEE
     (a) . TRMC shall pay a monthly fee (the "") to reserve, on a firm storage or transportation basis (as applicable), all of the existing aggregate Shell Capacity of all of the Tanks in the Storage Facility and all of the throughput capacity on TLO's Pipelines. Such fee shall be payable by TRMC on a monthly basis throughout the Term of the Agreement, regardless of the actual volumes of Products stored and/or transported by TLO on behalf of TRMC, provided, however, that the Parties shall from time to time negotiate an appropriate adjustment to such fee if the following conditions are met: (a) TRMC requires the full Operating Capacity of the Tanks, (b) the full Operating Capacity of the Tanks is not available to TRMC for any reason (other than any reason resulting from or relating to actions or inactions by TRMC), and (c) TLO is unable to otherwise accommodate the actual volumes of Products required to be stored and/or transported by TRMC pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Parties recognize that the existing Operating Capacity of certain Tanks is less than the Shell Capacity of such Tanks, but the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Storage and Transportation Fee shall be based upon the aggregate Shell Capacity of the Tanks. Such fee shall include all storage, pumping, and transshipment between and among the Tanks and the Pipelines.
Storage and Transportation Fee
Storage and Transportation Fee

Such reimbursement shall be made each Month at the time of the payment of the Storage and Transportation Fee.
Reimbursements
     (b) . TLO shall use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the interruption of service at each Pipeline and Tank. TLO shall promptly inform TRMC's operational personnel of any anticipated partial or complete interruption of service at any Pipeline or Tank, including relevant information about the nature, extent, cause and expected duration of the interruption and the actions TLO is taking to resume full operations, provided that TLO shall not have any liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, TRMC of any such matters except to the extent TRMC has been materially prejudiced or damaged by such failure or delay.
Service Interruptions
     (c) . Subject to Force Majeure and interruptions for routine repair and maintenance, consistent with customary terminal industry standards, TLO shall maintain each Pipeline and Tank in a condition and with a capacity sufficient to throughput a volume of TRMC's Products at least equal to the current Operating Capacity for such Pipeline and Tanks and the Storage Facility as a whole. TLO's obligations may be temporarily suspended during the occurrence of, and for the entire duration of, a Force Majeure or other interruption of service, to the extent such Force Majeure or other interruption of service impairs TLO's ability to perform such obligations. If for any reason, including, without limitation, a Force Majeure event, the throughput or storage capacity of any Pipeline or Tank should fall below its current Operating Capacity, then within a reasonable period of time thereafter, TLO shall make repairs to restore the capacity of such Pipeline or Tank to current Operating Capacity (""). Except as provided below in Section 6(d), all of such Restoration shall be at TLO's cost and expense unless the damage creating the need for such repairs was caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of TRMC, its employees, agents or customers.

     (d) . In the event of the failure of TLO to maintain any Pipeline or Tank in a condition and with a capacity sufficient to throughput and store a volume of TRMC's Products equal to its current Operating Capacity, then either Party shall have the right to call a meeting between executives of both Parties by providing at least two (2) Business Days' advance written notice. Any such meeting shall be held at a mutually agreeable location and will be attended by executives of both Parties each having sufficient authority to commit his or her respective Party to a Capacity Resolution (as defined below). At the meeting, the Parties will negotiate in good faith with the objective of reaching a joint resolution for the Restoration of capacity on the Pipeline or Tank which will, among other things, specify steps to be taken by TLO to fully accomplish Restoration and the deadlines by which the Restoration must be completed (the ""). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Capacity Resolution shall set forth an agreed upon time schedule for the Restoration activities. Such time schedule shall be reasonable under the circumstances, consistent with customary terminal industry standards and shall take into consideration TLO's economic considerations relating to costs of the repairs and TRMC's requirements concerning its refining and marketing operations. TLO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide storage and throughput of TRMC's Products at the Pipelines and Storage Facility, to the extent the Pipelines and Storage Facility have capability of doing so, during the period before Restoration is completed. In the event that TRMC's economic considerations

justify incurring additional costs to restore the Pipeline or Tank in a more expedited manner than the time schedule determined in accordance with the preceding sentences, TRMC may require TLO to expedite the Restoration to the extent reasonably possible, subject to TRMC's payment, in advance, of the estimated incremental costs to be incurred as a result of the expedited time schedule. In the event that the Operating Capacity of a Tank is reduced, and the Parties agree that the Restoration of such Tank to its full Operating Capacity is not justified under the standards set forth in the preceding sentences, then the Parties shall negotiate an appropriate adjustment to the Storage and Transportation Fee to account for the reduced Operating Capacity available for TRMC's use. In the event the Parties agree to an expedited Restoration plan in which TRMC agrees to fund a portion of the Restoration cost or a reduced Storage and Transportation Fee, then neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 20 below, so long as any such Restoration is completed with due diligence. TRMC shall pay its portion of the Restoration costs to TLO in advance based on an estimate based on reasonable engineering standards promulgated by the Association for Facilities EngineeringUpon completion, TRMC shall pay the difference between the actual portion of Restoration costs to be paid by TRMC pursuant to this Section 6(d) and the estimated amount paid under the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after receipt of TLO's invoice therefor, or, if appropriate, TLO shall pay TRMC the excess of the estimate paid by TRMC over TLO's actual costs as previously described within thirty (30) days after completion of the Restoration.

Any such Restoration required under this Section 6(e) shall be completed by TLO at TRMC's cost. TLO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide storage and throughput of TRMC's Products at the affected Tank or Pipeline while such Restoration is being completed. Any work performed by TLO pursuant to this Section 6(e) shall be performed and completed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable pipeline industry standards and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and/or regulations. Additionally, during such period after the occurrence of (x) a Partnership Change of Control or (y) a sale of the Refinery, TRMC may exercise any remedies available to it under this Agreement (other than termination), including the right to immediately seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief for specific performance by TLO of the applicable provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to make Restorations as described herein.
