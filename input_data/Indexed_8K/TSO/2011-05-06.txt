Adoption of Tesoro Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan
 
The Tesoro Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) became effective May 4, 2011 upon approval by the stockholders of the Tesoro Corporation (the Company) at the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  The Board of Directors of the Company had unanimously adopted and approved the Plan on February 23, 2011.
 
The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee).  Any current or prospective officer or employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as well as any nonemployee director is eligible to participate in the Plan.  The Plan provides the Committee with the authority to award incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and incentive bonuses (which may be paid in cash or stock, or a combination thereof), any of which may be performance-based.  The maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.16 2/3 (Common Stock) that may be issued under the Plan, subject to certain adjustments in the event of a change in the Companys capitalization, is equal to 6,700,000, plus any shares subject to outstanding awards under the Companys 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan that cease for any reason to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent they are exercised for or settled in vested and nonforfeitable shares).
 
Under the Plan, a participants annual share limit is equal to 750,000 shares of Common Stock.  Subject to certain exceptions, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to awards granted under the Plan during any calendar year to any one nonemployee director will not exceed 25,000.  The aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options granted under the Plan may not exceed 6,700,000, subject to possible adjustment upon a change in the Companys capitalization.  The maximum cash amount payable pursuant to that portion of an incentive bonus earned under the Plan for any 12-month period to any participant that is intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will not exceed $10,000,000.
 
The Plan prohibits granting stock options or stock appreciation rights (other than in the context of a merger or other acquisition) with exercise prices lower than the closing price of the underlying shares of Common Stock on the grant date.  No award outstanding under the Plan may be repriced, regranted through cancellation, including cancellation in exchange for other awards or options or stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original award, or otherwise amended to reduce the exercise price applicable thereto (other than in connection with a transaction or other change in the Companys capitalization).  The term of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted pursuant to the Plan may not exceed ten years.
 
The Plan will terminate with respect to the grant of new awards on February 23, 2021.
 
The foregoing description of the terms of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Form Agreement for 2011 Awards Under the Companys 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan
 
On May 4, 2011, the Compensation Committee approved the form of 2011 Grant Letter pursuant to which Performance Shares and Market Share Units may be issued under the Plan (the Grant Letter) and the Performance Share Awards Granted in 2011 Summary of Key Provisions (the PS Key Provisions) and the Market Share Unit Award Granted in 2011 Summary of Key Provisions (the MSU Key Provisions, and, together with the PS Key Provisions, the Key Provisions) to be used to set forth the terms of 2011 grants of performance shares and market share units to certain participants under the Plan, including the Companys named executive officers.
 
The Grant Letter and PS Key Provisions contemplate that performance shares of the Companys Common Stock contingent upon the achievement of certain performance goals will vest at the end of the 36 month performance period which lasts from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2014.  Upon vesting at the end of the performance period, awards will be adjusted based on achievement of the applicable performance conditions.  In the event of a change in control, the performance share awards will be paid out at the greater of the achievement of the target performance or the achievement of actual performance through a date determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the change in control.  If a grantees employment with the Company terminates due to retirement or involuntary termination, then such grantee will be issued a pro-rated payout of shares based on the number of full months, (minimum of 12 months required) worked within the performance period based on the achievement of actual performance.  If a grantees employment with the Company terminates due to death or disability, then such grantee will be issued a pro-rated payout of shares based on the number of full months, (minimum of 12 months required) worked within the performance period based on the achievement of target performance.  If a grantee terminates employment with the Company due to a voluntary termination or termination for cause prior to the vesting of the performance shares, the shares will be forfeited.
 
The Grant Letter and MSU Key Provisions contemplate that market stock units pursuant to which shares of the Companys Common Stock will be earned at vesting based on stock price performance will vest at the end of the 36 month performance period which lasts from May 11, 2011 through May 11, 2014.  Upon vesting at the end of the performance period, the number of shares earned will be adjusted by multiplying the factor of the average closing stock price for the 30 days prior to the vesting date over the average closing stock price for the 30 days prior to the grant date.  In the event of a change in control, the number of shares earned from the award of market stock units will be adjusted by the multiplying factor of the average closing stock price for the 30 days prior to the change in control over the average closing stock price for the 30 days prior to the grant date.  If a grantee's employment with the Company terminates due to retirement, then such grantee will be issued a pro-rated payout of shares based on the number of full months, (minimum of 12 months required) worked within the performance period based on the achievement of actual performance. If a grantee terminates employment with the Company for any reason other than a change in control, or retirement, prior to the vesting of the market stock units, the units will be forfeited.
 
The foregoing description of the terms of the Grant Letter and Key Provisions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the Grant Letter and Key Provisions, which are filed as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Any and all of the deceased Participants Options that are not exercised during the such period shall terminate as of the end of such period.  A Participants estate shall mean his or her legal representative or other person who so acquires the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the Participant.
 
(iii)           .  Upon Termination of Employment as a result of the Participants Disability, the Participants Options then held shall be exercisable during the period ending on the earlier of the date that is one (1) year after the date of Participants Termination of Employment or the date the Option would otherwise terminate, but only to the extent that the Options are exercisable as of that date.  Any and all Options that are not exercised during such period shall terminate as of the end of such period.
Disability
 
(iv)           .  Upon the Participants Termination of Employment by reason of his or her Retirement, the Participants Options then held shall be exercisable during the period ending on the earlier of the date that is three (3) years after the date of the Participants Termination of Employment or the expiration date of such Option, but only to the extent that the Options are exercisable as of the date of the Participants Termination of Employment.  Any and all Options that are not exercised during such period shall terminate as of the end of such period.
Retirement
 
(v)           .  Upon the date of a Participants Termination of Employment for Cause, any Option that is unexercised prior to the date of the Participants Termination of Employment shall terminate as of such date.
Cause
 
(vi)           .  Upon the date of a Participants Termination of Employment for any reason other than those stated above in Sections 6(e)(i), (e)(ii), (e)(iii), (e)(iv) and (e)(v) or as described in Section 15, the Participants Options then held shall be exercisable during the period ending on the earlier of the date that is three (3) months after the date of the Participants Termination of Employment or the expiration date of such Option, but only to the extent that the Options are exercisable as of the date of the Participants Termination of Employment.  Any and all Options that are not exercised during such period shall terminate as of the end of such period.
Other Reasons
 
(f)           .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6, in the case of the grant of an Option intending to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option:
Incentive Stock Options
(i) if the Participant owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company (a 10% Shareholder), the exercise price of such Option must be at least 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant and the Option must expire within a period of not more than five (5) years from the date of grant, and
 
 
 
8
 
 
(ii) Termination of Employment will occur when the person to whom an Award was granted ceases to be an employee (as determined in accordance with Section 3401(c) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) of the Company and its Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6 to the contrary, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall not be eligible for treatment under the Code as Incentive Stock Options (and will be deemed to be Nonqualified Stock Options) to the extent that either (a) the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares (determined as of the time of grant) with respect to which such Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted, or (b) such Options otherwise remain exercisable but are not exercised within three (3) months of Termination of Employment (or such other period of time provided in Section 422 of the Code).
 
Stock Appreciation Rights
7.
 
 
Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to Participants from time to time either in tandem with or as a component of other Awards granted under the Plan (tandem SARs) or not in conjunction with other Awards (freestanding SARs) and may, but need not, relate to a specific Option granted under Section 6.  The provisions of Stock Appreciation Rights need not be the same with respect to each grant or each recipient.  Any Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Award may be granted at the same time such Award is granted or at any time thereafter before exercise or expiration of such Award.  All freestanding SARs shall be granted subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to Options as set forth in Section 6 and all tandem SARs shall have the same exercise price, vesting, exercisability, forfeiture and termination provisions as the Award to which they relate.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6 and the immediately preceding sentence, the Administrator may impose such other conditions or restrictions on any Stock Appreciation Right as it shall deem appropriate.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be settled in Shares, cash or a combination thereof, as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.  Other than in connection with a change in the Companys capitalization (as described in Section 12), at any time when the exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right is above the Fair Market Value of a Share, the Company shall not, without stockholder approval, (i) reduce the exercise or base price of such Stock Appreciation Right, (ii) exchange such Stock Appreciation Right for cash, another Award or a new Option or Stock Appreciation Right with a lower exercise or base price or (iii) otherwise reprice such Stock Appreciation Right.
 
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
8.
 
 
(a)           .  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be granted at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of the Plan to Participants as determined by the Administrator.  Restricted Stock is an award of Shares, the grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or transferability of which is subject during specified periods of time to such conditions (including continued employment or performance conditions) and terms as the Administrator deems appropriate.  Restricted Stock Units are Awards denominated in units of Shares under which the issuance of Shares is subject to such conditions (including continued employment or performance conditions) and terms as the Administrator deems appropriate.  Each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.  Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, each Restricted Stock Unit will be equal to one Share and will entitle a Participant to either the issuance of Shares or payment of an amount of cash determined with reference to the value of Shares.  To the extent determined by the Administrator, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be satisfied or settled in Shares, cash or a combination thereof.  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Plan need not be identical but each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units must contain and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
 
 
 
9
 
(b)           .  Each Award Agreement shall contain provisions regarding (i) the number of Shares or Restricted Stock Units subject to such Award or a formula for determining such number, (ii) the purchase price of the Shares, if any, and the means of payment, (iii) the performance criteria, if any, and level of achievement versus these criteria that shall determine the number of Shares or Restricted Stock Units granted, issued, retainable and/or vested, (iv) such terms and conditions on the grant, issuance, vesting and/or forfeiture of the Shares or Restricted Stock Units as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator, (v) the term of the performance period, if any, as to which performance will be measured for determining the number of such Shares or Restricted Stock Units, and (vi) restrictions on the transferability of the Shares or Restricted Stock Units.  Shares issued under a Restricted Stock Award may be issued in the name of the Participant and held by the Participant or held by the Company, in each case as the Administrator may provide.
Contents of Agreement
 
(c)           .  The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units will occur when and in such installments as the Administrator determines or under criteria the Administrator establishes, which may include Qualifying Performance Criteria.  Other than with respect to Awards to Nonemployee Directors, the grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of Shares under any such Award that is based on performance criteria and level of achievement versus such criteria will be subject to a performance period of not less than twelve months, and the grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of Shares under any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award that is based solely upon continued employment and/or the passage of time may not vest or be settled in full prior to the thirty-sixth month following its date of grant, except that the Administrator may provide for the satisfaction and/or lapse of all conditions under any such Award in the event of the Participants death, disability, Retirement or in connection with a Change in Control, and the Administrator may provide that any such restriction or limitation will not apply in the case of a Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award that is issued in payment or settlement of compensation that has been earned by the Participant.  In addition, the Administrator may grant awards of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units that result in issuing up to 5% of the maximum aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance under the Plan (as set forth in Section 5(a)) without regard to the minimum vesting requirements set forth in the preceding sentence.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the performance criteria for any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit that is intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code will be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Administrator and specified when the Award is granted.
Vesting and Performance Criteria
 
 
 
10
 
(d)           :  Upon the Participants Termination of Employment, his or her rights to unvested Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units then held shall be only as follows, unless the Administrator specifies otherwise (either in an Award Agreement or otherwise):
Termination of Employment
 
(i)           .  In the event of a Participants Termination of Employment by reason of his or her death, Disability, or Retirement, any portion of any Award of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units that is not vested as of the date of a Participants Termination of Employment shall immediately be forfeited by the Participant; provided, however, that the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, provide for accelerated vesting of unvested Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units upon such terms and the Administrator deems advisable (either in an Award Agreement or otherwise).
Death, Disability, Retirement
 
(ii)           .  In the event of a Participants Termination of Employment for any reason other than those stated above in Section 8(d)(i), any portion of any Award of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units that is not vested as of the date of a Participants Termination of Employment shall immediately be forfeited by the Participant; provided, however, that the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, other than in the event of a Termination of Employment for Cause and in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 8(c), provide for accelerated vesting of unvested Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units upon such terms and the Administrator deems advisable (either in an Award Agreement or otherwise).
Other Reasons
 
(iii)           .  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8(d) to the contrary, with respect to any Performance Award granted pursuant to this Section 8, in the event a Participants Termination of Employment by reason of his or her death, Disability, Retirement, or involuntary Termination of Employment by the Company without Cause during a performance period (and, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the case of a termination by the Company without Cause, at least twelve (12) months after the beginning of the performance), the Participant shall receive a prorated payout of the Performance Award.  The prorated payout shall be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and shall be based upon the length of time that the Participant held the Performance Award during the performance period and the Companys actual results during the performance period as compared to the performance criteria to which the Performance Award is subject.
Performance Awards
 
(e)           .  Subject to the limits imposed under Section 162(m) of the Code for Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of Shares granted, issued, retainable and/or vested under an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units on account of either financial performance or personal performance evaluations may, to the extent specified in the Award Agreement, be reduced, but not increased, by the Administrator on the basis of such further considerations as the Administrator shall determine.
Discretionary Adjustments and Limits
 
(f)           .  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, Participants holding shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares during the period of restriction.  Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units unless and until such Shares are reflected as issued and outstanding shares on the Companys stock ledger.
Voting Rights
 
 
 
11
 
(g)           .  Participants in whose name an Award of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units is granted shall be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the Shares underlying such Award, unless determined otherwise by the Administrator.  The Administrator will determine whether any such dividends or distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional Shares or will be payable in cash; provided that such additional Shares and/or cash shall subject to the same restrictions and vesting conditions as the Award with respect to which they were distributed.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall dividends or dividend equivalents be currently payable with respect to unvested or unearned Performance Awards.
Dividends and Distributions
 
Incentive Bonuses
9.
 
 
(a)           .  Each Incentive Bonus Award will confer upon the Participant the opportunity to earn a future payment tied to the level of achievement with respect to one or more performance criteria established for a performance period of not less than one year.
General
 
(b)           .  The terms of any Incentive Bonus will be set forth in an Award Agreement or other written document establishing the terms and conditions of the Award.  Each such Award Agreement or other written document shall contain provisions regarding (i) the threshold, target and maximum amount payable to the Participant as an Incentive Bonus, (ii) the performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria that shall determine the amount of such payment, (iii) the term of the performance period as to which performance shall be measured for determining the amount of any payment, (iv) the timing of any payment earned by virtue of performance, (v) restrictions on the alienation or transfer of the Incentive Bonus prior to actual payment, (vi) forfeiture provisions and (vii) such further terms and conditions, in each case not inconsistent with this Plan as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator.
Incentive Bonus Document
 
(c)           .  The Administrator shall establish the performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria that shall determine the threshold, target and maximum amount payable under an Incentive Bonus, which criteria may be based on financial performance and/or personal performance evaluations.  The Administrator may specify the percentage of the target Incentive Bonus that is intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the performance criteria for any portion of an Incentive Bonus that is intended by the Administrator to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Administrator and specified at the time the Incentive Bonus is granted.  The Administrator shall certify the extent to which any Qualifying Performance Criteria has been satisfied, and the amount payable as a result thereof, prior to payment of any Incentive Bonus that is intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Performance Criteria
 
 
 
12
 
(d)           .  The Administrator shall determine the timing of payment of any Incentive Bonus.  Payment of the amount due under an Incentive Bonus may be made in cash or in Shares, as determined by the Administrator.  The Administrator may provide for or, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for the payment of any Incentive Bonus to be deferred to a specified date or event.
Timing and Form of Payment
 
(e)           .  Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals the amount paid under an Incentive Bonus on account of either financial performance or personal performance evaluations may, to the extent specified in the Award Agreement or other written document establishing the terms and conditions of the Award, be reduced or increased by the Administrator on the basis of such further considerations as the Administrator shall determine; provided, however, that with respect to Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall not have the discretion to increase the amount paid under an Incentive Bonus.
Discretionary Adjustments
 
Deferral of Gains
10.
 
 
The Administrator may, in an Award Agreement or otherwise, provide for the deferred delivery of Shares upon settlement, vesting or other events with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or in payment or satisfaction of an Incentive Bonus.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will any deferral of the delivery of Shares or any other payment with respect to any Award be allowed if the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, that the deferral would result in the imposition of the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.  No Award shall provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Board, at the time of grant, specifically provides that the Award is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  The Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Board.
 
Conditions and Restrictions Upon Securities Subject to Awards
11.
 
 
The Administrator may provide that the Shares issued upon exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or otherwise subject to or issued under an Award shall be subject to such further agreements, restrictions, conditions or limitations as the Administrator in its discretion may specify prior to the exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right or the grant, vesting or settlement of such Award, including without limitation, conditions on vesting or transferability, forfeiture or repurchase provisions and method of payment for the Shares issued upon exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award (including the actual or constructive surrender of Shares already owned by the Participant) or payment of taxes arising in connection with an Award.  Without limiting the foregoing, such restrictions may address the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued under an Award, including without limitation (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (ii) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (iii) restrictions in connection with any underwritten public offering by the Company of the Companys securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, (iv) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (v) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.

Adjustment of and Changes in the Stock
12.
 
 
The number and kind of Shares available for issuance under this Plan (including under any Awards then outstanding), and the number and kind of Shares subject to the individual limits set forth in Section 5 of this Plan, shall be equitably adjusted by the Administrator as it determines appropriate to reflect any reorganization, reclassification, combination of shares, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, dividend or distribution of securities, property or cash (other than regular, quarterly cash dividends), or any other event or transaction that affects the number or kind of Shares of the Company outstanding.  Such adjustment shall be designed to comply with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code or, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 5(c) of this Plan, may be designed to treat the Shares available under the Plan and subject to Awards as if they were all outstanding on the record date for such event or transaction or to increase the number of such Shares to reflect a deemed reinvestment in Shares of the amount distributed to the Companys securityholders.  The terms of any outstanding Award shall also be equitably adjusted by the Administrator as to price, number or kind of Shares subject to such Award, vesting, and other terms to reflect the foregoing events, which adjustments need not be uniform as between different Awards or different types of Awards.
 
In the event there shall be any other change in the number or kind of outstanding Shares, or any stock or other securities into which such Shares shall have been changed, or for which it shall have been exchanged, by reason of a Change in Control, other merger, consolidation or otherwise, then the Administrator shall, in its sole discretion, determine the appropriate and equitable adjustment, if any, to be effected.
 
No right to purchase fractional shares shall result from any adjustment in Awards pursuant to this Section 12.  In case of any such adjustment, the Shares subject to the Award shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.  The Company shall notify Participants holding Awards subject to any adjustments pursuant to this Section 12 of such adjustment, but (whether or not notice is given) such adjustment shall be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
 
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Award Agreement or another contract, including an employment agreement, or under the terms of a transaction constituting a Change in Control, the Administrator may provide that any or all of the following shall occur upon a Participants Termination of Employment within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control: (a) in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant shall have the ability to exercise any portion of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right not previously exercisable, (b) in the case of a Performance Award or Incentive Bonus, the Participant shall have the right to receive a payment equal to the target amount payable or, if greater, a payment based on performance through a date determined by the Administrator prior to the Change in Control, and (c) in the case of Shares issued in payment of an Incentive Bonus, and/or in the case of outstanding Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units, all conditions to the grant, issuance, retention, vesting or transferability of, or any other restrictions applicable to, such Award shall immediately lapse.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control in which the acquiring or surviving company in the transaction does not assume or continue outstanding Awards upon the Change in Control, immediately prior to the Change in Control, all Awards that are not assumed or continued shall be treated as follows effective immediately prior to the Change in Control: (a) in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant shall have the ability to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, including any portion of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right not previously exercisable, (b) in the case of a Performance Award or Incentive Bonus, the Participant shall have the right to receive a payment equal to the target amount payable or, if greater, a payment based on performance through a date determined by the Administrator prior to the Change in Control, and (c) in the case of Shares issued in payment of an Incentive Bonus, and/or in the case of outstanding Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units, all conditions to the grant, issuance, retention, vesting or transferability of, or any other restrictions applicable to, such Award shall immediately lapse.

Qualifying Performance-Based Compensation
13.
 
 
(a)           .  The Administrator may establish performance criteria and level of achievement versus such criteria that shall determine the number of Shares, units, or cash to be granted, retained, vested, issued or issuable under or in settlement of or the amount payable pursuant to an Award, which criteria may be based on Qualifying Performance Criteria or other standards of financial performance and/or personal performance evaluations.  A Performance Award may be identified as Performance Share, Performance Equity, Performance Unit or other such term as chosen by the Administrator.  In addition, the Administrator may specify that an Award or a portion of an Award is intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, provided that the performance criteria for such Award or portion of an Award that is intended by the Administrator to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Administrator and specified at the time the Award is granted.  The Administrator shall certify the extent to which any Qualifying Performance Criteria has been satisfied, and the amount payable as a result thereof, prior to payment, settlement or vesting of any Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of Shares issued under or the amount paid under an award may, to the extent specified in the Award Agreement, be reduced, but not increased, by the Administrator on the basis of such further considerations as the Administrator in its sole discretion shall determine.
General
 
(b)           .  For purposes of this Plan, the term Qualifying Performance Criteria shall mean any one or more of the following performance criteria, or derivations of such performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, applied to either the Company as a whole or to a business unit or Subsidiary, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to previous years results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Administrator: (i) cash flow (before or after dividends), (ii) earning or earnings per share (including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), (iii) stock price, (iv) return on equity, (v) total stockholder return, (vi) return on capital or investment (including return on total capital, return on invested capital, or return on investment), (vii) return on assets or net assets, (viii) market capitalization, (ix) economic value added, (x) debt leverage (debt to capital), (xi) revenue, (xii) income or net income, (xiii) operating income, (xiv) operating profit or net operating profit, (xv) operating margin or profit margin, (xvi) return on operating revenue, (xvii) cash from operations, (xviii) operating ratio, (xix) operating revenue, (xx) NSR and/or total backlog, (xxi) days sales outstanding, (xxii) customer service, (xxiii) operational safety, reliability and/or efficiency; (xxiv) environmental incidents.

Transferability
14.
 
 
Each Award may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and each Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable only by the Participant during his or her lifetime.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the Administrator, the person to whom an Award is initially granted (the Grantee) may transfer an Award to any family member of the Grantee (as such term is defined in Section 1(a)(5) of the General Instructions to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Form S-8)), to trusts solely for the benefit of such family members and to partnerships in which such family members and/or trusts are the only partners; provided that, (i) as a condition thereof, the transferor and the transferee must execute a written agreement containing such terms as specified by the Administrator, and (ii) the transfer is pursuant to a gift or a domestic relations order to the extent permitted under the General Instructions to Form S-8.  Except to the extent specified otherwise in the agreement the Administrator provides for the Grantee and transferee to execute, all vesting, exercisability and forfeiture provisions that are conditioned on the Grantees continued employment or service shall continue to be determined with reference to the Grantees employment or service (and not to the status of the transferee) after any transfer of an Award pursuant to this Section 14, and the responsibility to pay any taxes in connection with an Award shall remain with the Grantee notwithstanding any transfer other than by will or intestate succession.

Suspension or Termination of Awards
15.
 
 
Except as otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at any time (including after a notice of exercise has been delivered or an award has vested) the Chief Executive Officer or any other person designated by the Administrator (each such person, an Authorized Officer) reasonably believes that a Participant may have committed an Act of Misconduct as described in this Section 15, the Authorized Officer, Administrator or the Board may suspend the Participants rights to exercise any Option, to vest in an Award, and/or to receive payment for or receive Shares in settlement of an Award pending a determination of whether an Act of Misconduct has been committed.
 
If the Administrator or an Authorized Officer determines a Participant has committed an act of embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty, nonpayment of any obligation owed to the Company or any Subsidiary, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Company ethics policy or code of conduct, or deliberate disregard of the Company or Subsidiary rules resulting in loss, damage or injury to the Company or any Subsidiary, or if a Participant makes an unauthorized disclosure of any Company or Subsidiary trade secret or confidential information, solicits any employee or service provider to leave the employ or cease providing services to the Company or any Subsidiary, breaches any intellectual property or assignment of inventions covenant, engages in any conduct constituting unfair competition, breaches any non-competition agreement, induces any Company or Subsidiary customer to breach a contract with the Company or any Subsidiary or to cease doing business with the Company or any Subsidiary, or induces any principal for whom the Company or any Subsidiary acts as agent to terminate such agency relationship (any of the foregoing acts, an Act of Misconduct), then except as otherwise provided by the Administrator, (i) neither the Participant nor his or her estate nor transferee shall be entitled to exercise any Option or Stock Appreciation Right whatsoever, vest in or have the restrictions on an Award lapse, or otherwise receive payment of an Award, (ii) the Participant will forfeit all outstanding Awards and (iii) the Participant may be required, at the Administrators sole discretion, to return and/or repay to the Company any then unvested Shares previously issued under the Plan.  In making such determination, the Administrator or an Authorized Officer shall give the Participant an opportunity to appear and present evidence on his or her behalf at a hearing before the Administrator or its designee or an opportunity to submit written comments, documents, information and arguments to be considered by the  Administrator.
 
Compliance with Laws and Regulations
16.
 
 
This Plan, the grant, issuance, vesting, exercise and settlement of Awards thereunder, and the obligation of the Company to sell, issue or deliver Shares under such Awards, shall be subject to all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, stock exchange rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required.  The Company shall not be required to register in a Participants name or deliver any Shares prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any foreign, federal, state or local law or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Administrator shall determine to be necessary or advisable.  To the extent the Company is unable to or the Administrator deems it infeasible to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  No Option shall be exercisable and no Shares shall be issued and/or transferable under any other Award unless a registration statement with respect to the Shares underlying such Option is effective and current or the Company has determined that such registration is unnecessary.
 
 
 
17
 
 
In the event an Award is granted to or held by a Participant who is employed or providing services outside the United States, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, modify the provisions of the Plan or of such Award as they pertain to such individual to comply with applicable foreign law or to recognize differences in local law, currency or tax policy.  The Administrator may also impose conditions on the grant, issuance, exercise, vesting, settlement or retention of Awards in order to comply with such foreign law and/or to minimize the Companys obligations with respect to tax equalization for Participants employed outside their home country.
 
Withholding
17.
 
 
To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, a Participant shall be required to satisfy, in a manner satisfactory to the Company, any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of an Option exercise, the vesting of or settlement of an Award, an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code or otherwise with respect to an Award.  To the extent a Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, within ten days of filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service, the Participant must notify the Company in writing of such election.  The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to issue Shares, make any payment or to recognize the transfer or disposition of Shares until all withholding tax obligations are satisfied.  The Administrator may provide for or permit these obligations to be satisfied through the mandatory or elective sale of Shares and/or by having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued to him or her upon exercise of the Option or the vesting or settlement of an Award, or by tendering Shares previously acquired.  In addition, the Company shall be entitled to deduct from other compensation payable to each Participant any withholding tax obligations that arise in connection with an Award or require the Participant to pay such sums directly to the Company in cash or by check.
 
Administration of the Plan
18.
 
 
(a)           .  The Plan shall be administered by the Administrator who shall be the Compensation Committee of the Board or, in the absence of a Compensation Committee, the Board itself.  Any power of the Administrator may also be exercised by the Board, except to the extent that the grant or exercise of such authority would cause any Award or transaction to become subject to (or lose an exemption under) the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or cause an Award designated as a Performance Award not to qualify for treatment as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.  To the extent that any permitted action taken by the Board conflicts with action taken by the Administrator, the Board action shall control.  The Compensation Committee may by resolution authorize one or more officers of the Company to perform any or all things that the Administrator is authorized and empowered to do or perform under the Plan, and for all purposes under this Plan, such officer or officers shall be treated as the Administrator; provided, however, that the resolution so authorizing such officer or officers shall specify the total number of Awards (if any) such officer or officers may award pursuant to such delegated authority.  No such officer shall designate himself or herself as a recipient of any Awards granted under authority delegated to such officer.  In addition, the Compensation Committee may delegate any or all aspects of the day-to-day administration of  the Plan to one or more officers or employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, and/or to one or more agents.
Administrator of the Plan

(b)           .  Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Administrator shall be authorized and empowered to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the administration of this Plan, including, without limitation: (i) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to this Plan and to define terms not otherwise defined herein; (ii) to determine which persons are Participants, to which of such Participants, if any, Awards shall be granted hereunder and the timing of any such Awards; (iii) to grant Awards to Participants and determine the terms and conditions thereof, including the number of Shares subject to Awards and the exercise or purchase price of such Shares and the circumstances under which Awards become exercisable or vested or are forfeited or expire, which terms may but need not be conditioned upon the passage of time, continued employment, the satisfaction of performance criteria, the occurrence of certain events, or other factors; (iv) to establish and verify the extent of satisfaction of any performance goals or other conditions applicable to the grant, issuance, exercisability, vesting and/or ability to retain any Award; (v) to prescribe and amend the terms of the agreements or other documents evidencing Awards made under this Plan (which need not be identical) and the terms of or form of any document or notice required to be delivered to the Company by Participants under this Plan; (vi) to determine whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 12; (vii) to interpret and construe this Plan, any rules and regulations under this Plan and the terms and conditions of any Award granted hereunder, and to make exceptions to any such provisions if the Administrator, in good faith, determines that it is necessary to do so in light of extraordinary circumstances and for the benefit of the Company; (viii) to approve corrections in the documentation or administration of any Award; and (ix) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan.  The Administrator may, in its sole and absolute discretion, without amendment to the Plan, waive or amend the operation of Plan provisions respecting exercise after Termination of Employment or service to the Company or an affiliate and, except as otherwise provided herein, adjust any of the terms of any Award.
Powers of Administrator
 
(c)           .  All decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Administrator regarding the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan and the terms and conditions of or operation of any Award granted hereunder, shall be final and binding on all Participants, beneficiaries, heirs, assigns or other persons holding or claiming rights under the Plan or any Award.  The Administrator shall consider such factors as it deems relevant, in its sole and absolute discretion, to making such decisions, determinations and interpretations including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any officer or other employee of the Company and such attorneys, consultants and accountants as it may select.
Determinations by the Administrator
 
(d)           .  In the case of a grant of an Award to any Participant employed by a Subsidiary, such grant may, if the Administrator so directs, be implemented by the Company issuing Shares to the Subsidiary, for such lawful consideration as the Administrator may determine, upon the condition or understanding that the Subsidiary will transfer the Shares to the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Award specified by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, such Award may be issued by and in the name of the Subsidiary and shall be deemed granted on such date as the Administrator shall determine.

No amendment or alteration to the Plan or an Award or Award Agreement shall be made which would impair the rights of the holder of an Award, without such holders consent, provided that no such consent shall be required if the Administrator determines in its sole discretion and prior to the date of any Change in Control that such amendment or alteration either is required or advisable in order for the Company, the Plan or the Award to satisfy any law or regulation or to meet the requirements of or avoid adverse financial accounting consequences under any accounting standard.
 
No Liability of Company
20.
 
 
The Company and any Subsidiary or affiliate which is in existence or hereafter comes into existence shall not be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (i) the non-issuance or sale of Shares as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder; and (ii) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Award granted hereunder.
 
Non-Exclusivity of Plan
21.
 
 
Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor the submission of this Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or the Administrator to adopt such other incentive arrangements as either may deem desirable, including without limitation, an arrangement not intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
Governing Law
22.
 
 
This Plan and any agreements or other documents hereunder shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the Texas to the extent not preempted by federal law.  Any reference in this Plan or in the agreement or other document evidencing any Awards to a provision of law or to a rule or regulation shall be deemed to include any successor law, rule or regulation of similar effect or applicability.

No Right to Employment, Reelection or Continued Service
23.
 
 
Nothing in this Plan or an Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its affiliates to terminate any Participants employment, service on the Board or service for the Company at any time or for any reason not prohibited by law, nor shall this Plan or an Award itself confer upon any Participant any right to continue his or her employment or service for any specified period of time.  Neither an Award nor any benefits arising under this Plan shall constitute an employment contract with the Company, any Subsidiary and/or its affiliates.  Subject to Sections 4 and 19, this Plan and the benefits hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Board without giving rise to any liability on the part of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its affiliates.
 
Unfunded Plan
24.
 
 
The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan.  Participants are and shall at all times be general creditors of the Company with respect to their Awards.  If the Administrator or the Company chooses to set aside funds in a trust or otherwise for the payment of Awards under the Plan, such funds shall at all times be subject to the claims of the creditors of the Company in the event of its bankruptcy or insolvency.
 
Section 409A
25.
 
 
It is intended that any Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, and Restricted Stock issued pursuant to this Plan and any Award Agreement shall not constitute deferrals of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, as a result, shall not be subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  It is further intended that any Restricted Stock Units and Incentive Bonuses issued pursuant to this Plan and any Award Agreement or other written document establishing the terms and conditions of the Award (which may or may not constitute deferrals of compensation, depending on the terms of each Award) shall avoid any plan failures within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.  The Plan and each Award Agreement or other written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award is to be interpreted and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions.  However, no guarantee or commitment is made that the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award shall be administered in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, with respect to amounts that are subject to such requirements, or that the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award shall be administered in a manner that avoids the application of Section 409A of the Code, with respect to amounts that are not subject to such requirements.
 
 
 
21
 
 
Required Delay in Payment on Account of a Separation from Service
26.
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, any Award Agreement or any other written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award, if any Award recipient is a specified employee, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(i), as of the date of his or her Separation from Service (as defined in authoritative IRS guidance under Section 409A of the Code), then, to the extent required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(2), any payment made to the Award recipient on account of his or her Separation from Service shall not be made before a date that is six months after the date of his or her Separation from Service.  The Administrator may elect any of the methods of applying this rule that are permitted under Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-3(i)(2)(ii).
