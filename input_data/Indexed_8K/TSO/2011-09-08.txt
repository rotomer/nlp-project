Exhibit 99.1
TESORO TO BOOST REFINING AND MARKETING INTEGRATION WITH NEARLY 25 PERCENT INCREASE IN RETAIL STATIONS
SAN ANTONIO, TX - September 8, 2011 - Tesoro Corporation (NYSE: TSO) today announced that it will add approximately 290 retail stations to its existing portfolio of nearly 1,200 stations through separate purchase and lease agreements with SUPERVALU, Inc. (NYSE: SVU) and Thrifty Oil Co., respectively.
The combined purchase and lease of these stations strengthens our refining and marketing integration by about 12%, adds profitable and secure outlets for our refined products and improves our company's overall portfolio of retail assets, said Greg Goff, president and CEO, Tesoro.
Tesoro will purchase from SUPERVALU, Inc. 51 Albertson's Fuel Express stations for $34 million, and plans to invest an incremental $5 million in branding capital. These stations are located in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming with total fuel sales of more than 5,000 barrels per day. Tesoro expects to complete the transaction near the end of 2011.
Separately, Tesoro will lease from Thrifty Oil Co. 241 retail stations located primarily in southern California for an initial term of 10 years, and will invest $28 million in branding capital. These stations have total fuel sales of 25,000 - 30,000 barrels per day. Tesoro will take possession of the stations in a phased process, with approximately 190 stations online in 2012 and the balance of approximately 50 stations in 2014.
The majority of both the purchased and leased stations will be marketed under Tesoro's existing brands.

EBITDA represents earnings before interest and financing costs, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense. We present EBITDA because we believe some investors and analysts use EBITDA to help analyze our cash flows including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to use cash for other purposes, including capital expenditures. EBTIDA is also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and by management for internal analysis and as a component of the fixed charge coverage financial covenant in our credit agreement. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings, earnings before income taxes, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. 18 Non-GAAP Financial Measure (In millions) Unaudited Six Months Ended June 30, First Year Estimate 2009 2010 2011 Mandan Expansion Bakken Crude Oil to Anacortes Los Angeles Yield Improvement Net Earnings (Loss) $ 6 $ (88) $ 325 $ 43 $ 35 $ 15 Add (Less) income tax expense (benefit)* 4 (44 ) 205 26 22 9 Add interest and financing costs 56 74 103    Add depreciation and amortization expense 213 208 209 1 3 1 EBITDA $ 279 $ 150 $ 842 $ 70 $ 60 $ 25 * First year income tax expense for capital projects is estimated using the six months ended June 30, 2011 effective tax rate of 38%.
