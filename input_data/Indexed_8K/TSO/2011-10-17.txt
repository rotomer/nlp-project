The Facility Agreements are 364-day facilities that are non-recourse to the Company, meaning that only TPSA is liable to reimburse the lenders for any borrowed amounts or interest thereon. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, other than TPSA, are borrowers or guarantors under the Facility Agreements. This summary of the material terms of the Facility Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Facility Agreements, copies of which are attached as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.
The Company formed TPSA to further utilize its pipeline and tank assets in Panama by enhancing strategic partnerships, developing economies of scale around freight and storage opportunities, expanding global commercial relationships and evaluating opportunities to source crude from alternative supply markets for trade or transportation.
The Facility Agreements will provide for (a) up to $350 million in an uncommitted, senior-secured revolving credit facility (Facility A) available for revolving loans, swing line loans, daylight overdraft loans and the issuance on an uncommitted basis of letters of credit (LCs) and (b) up to $150 million in an uncommitted, senior-secured facility (Facility B) available for Trade LCs. Facilities A and B are each available on an uncommitted basis subject to the applicable facility maximum amount and collateral pool (at closing the Combined Facility Maximum Amount was $500 million comprised of $350 million for Facility A and $150 million for Facility B).
The Facility Agreements include an accordion feature which permits TPSA to increase the combined facilities up to $700 million, provided that the Facilities A and B maximum amounts do not exceed $550 million and $150 million, respectively.
Under the Credit Agreement, each extension of credit will bear interest, at the following rates per annum:
(i) If such extension of credit is a Revolving Loan, TPSA may select between an Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin (currently 2.75%), or an Alternative Base Rate (currently 1.75%).
(ii) If such extension of credit is a Daylight Overdraft Loan or Swing Line Loan, the Alternative Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin plus 0.50% per annum.
If an extension of credit is a Letter of Credit, TPSA will pay letter of credit fees of (i) 1.75% per annum of the face amount of Trade Letters of Credit, and (ii) 2.75% per annum of the face amount of Long Term Letters of Credit or Performance Letters of Credit.
The Credit Agreement contains the following default financial covenants:
 (i) The leverage ratio must be less than or equal to 10:1.
(ii) The Company must maintain a Minimum Adjusted Tangible Net Worth, based on the Combined Facility Maximum Amount (currently $50 million).
(iii) The Company must maintain Minimum Adjusted Net Working Capital, based on the Combined Facility Maximum Amount (currently $50 million).
(iv) The Company must maintain inventory levels below certain thresholds depending on the Combined Facility Maximum Amount (currently 4 million barrels).

of this Agreement shall be applicable), each of the Lenders hereunder shall be obligated, regardless of whether it has affirmatively agreed to fund its Pro Rata Share of the related Revolving Borrowing, prior to 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the date such Revolving Loan is to be made, to make available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Principal Office, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Loan, multiplied by the amount of such Revolving Loan. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of all applicable conditions precedent in
Article VI
hereof, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower, no later than close of business on that same Business Day, by crediting the amount of such Borrowing to the account of the Borrower more fully described in
Schedule 3.03
hereto (in which the Collateral Agent shall have been granted a first priority (subject to Permitted Liens) perfected security interest).
(b)    Each Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. The Borrower will indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure of the Borrower to fulfill, on or before
45
the date requested for a Borrowing in the related Borrowing Request, the applicable conditions precedent thereto set forth in
Article VI
hereof, including any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of any deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund any Loan to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
(c)    Unless the Administrative Agent has received a written Notice of Declining Lender from one or more Lenders in the form of
Exhibit J
prior to 5:00 p.m., New York time, one (1) Business Day prior to the Administrative Agent's receipt of any Borrowing Request, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender will make its portion of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
Section 3.03(a)
of this Agreement and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance on such assumption, cause to be distributed to the Borrower on such date the full amount of each of the Lenders' ratable portion of such Borrowing, and if such amount is not made available by any Lender as required pursuant to
Section 3.03(a)
of this Agreement, then with respect to such amounts that are unpaid for less than two (2) Business Days, the Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate and with respect to such amounts that are unpaid thereafter, the Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender with interest thereon at the interest rate otherwise applicable to such Loan (including the Applicable Margin) pursuant to
Section 3.07
of this Agreement and
provided
further
that in the event such amount shall not be paid by such Lender within five (5) Business Days, the Borrower shall be required to either prepay such Lender's pro rata portion of such Loan in full with any additional compensation required pursuant to
Section 5.05
of this Agreement or deposit Cash Collateral with the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount equal to such Lender's pro rata portion of such Loan.
(d)    The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.
SECTION 3.04    
Optional Prepayments
.    
The Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans or to Convert Loans of one Type into Loans of another Type or Continue Loans of one Type as Loans of the same Type, at any time or from time to time, in a minimum amount equal to $100,000 without premium or penalty; provided that (a) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each such prepayment, Conversion or Continuation (and, upon the date specified in any such notice of prepayment, the amount to be prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder); (b) any prepayment of Loans shall include a payment of accrued interest on the amounts prepaid through and including the date of prepayment, and (c) in the event that Eurodollar Rate Loans are prepaid or Converted on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans, the Borrower shall also be required to pay additional amounts as provided in
Section 5.05
of this Agreement. Upon full repayment of all of the Obligations of the Borrower hereunder and receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the facility
46
evidenced by this Agreement shall be terminated and all liens released in accordance with the provisions of the Security Agreements.
SECTION 3.05    
Mandatory Prepayments of Loans

Sections 2.04(a)
or
2.05
of this Agreement), (ii) the Collateral Pool, or (iii) $700,000,000, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day, and without notice or demand, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans outstanding at such time by an amount equal to the applicable excess and if upon repayment of all Loans there remains an excess amount, such excess amount shall be covered with Cash Collateral as provided in
Section 4.06
of this Agreement; and
(c)    if for any reason the aggregate amount of outstanding Swing Line Loans shall exceed the Swing Line Sublimit, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day, and without notice or demand, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Loans outstanding at such time by an amount equal to the applicable excess.
(d)    Upon the sale of any assets or property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the sale of Inventory or other disposition of obsolete or worn out property in the ordinary course of the Borrower's or such Subsidiary's business), the Borrowers shall immediately prepay the outstanding Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale (
provided
,
however
, that no such prepayment shall be required in an amount in excess of the then outstanding Loans).
(e)    Upon the issuance or incurrence of any senior Indebtedness (other than hereunder or under Facility B or Indebtedness otherwise permitted under
Section 9.05
of this Agreement) by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date, the Borrower shall immediately prepay the outstanding Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such senior Indebtedness (
provided
,
however
, that no such prepayment shall be required in an amount in excess of the then outstanding Loans).
47
(f)    Upon receipt by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any extraordinary gains resulting from a transaction not in the ordinary course of the Borrower's business, or any proceeds of insurance in an aggregate amount in excess of $100,000, with respect to any Collateral, the Borrower shall immediately prepay the outstanding Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such extraordinary gain or proceeds (
provided
,
however
, that no such prepayment shall be required in an amount in excess of the then outstanding Loans).
SECTION 3.06    
Repayment
.
The outstanding principal amount of each Loan shall be due and payable on the sooner to occur of (a) its Maturity Date or (b) the Expiration Date. All outstanding Obligations shall be due and payable on the Expiration Date.
SECTION 3.07    
Interest
.
(a)
The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by such Lender for the period from and including the date of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:
i.
If such Loan is a Revolving Loan, during such periods as such Revolving Loan is an Eurodollar Rate Loan, for each Interest Period relating thereto, the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period
plus
the Applicable Margin;
ii.
If such Loan is a Revolving Loan, during such periods as such Revolving Loan is an Alternative Base Rate Loan, the Alternative Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Margin; and
iii.
If such Loan is a Daylight Overdraft Loan or Swing Line Loan, the Alternative Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Margin
plus
0.50% per annum.
(b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount of principal of or interest on any Loan, or any other amount payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document is not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, demand or otherwise), the Borrower agrees to pay interest on such unpaid principal or other amount, from the date such amount becomes due until the date such amount is paid in full, and after as well as before any entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.
(c)
Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) (A) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the last day of each Interest Period therefore and the Maturity Date thereof, and (B) with respect to Alternative Base Rate Loans, on the last day of each calendar month and on the Maturity Date of such Loan, and (ii) upon the payment or prepayment thereof or the Conversion of such Loan to a Loan of another Type (but only on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or Converted), except that interest payable at the Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand of the Required Lenders. Promptly after the determination of any interest rate provided for
48
herein or any change therein, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and to the Borrower.
(d)
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required for any period for which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by the Administrative Agent would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to the Administrative Agent limiting the highest rate of interest that may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by the Administrative Agent, and in such event the Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent interest at the highest rate permitted by applicable law.
(e)
Regardless of any provision contained in any Note or in any of the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have contracted for or be entitled to receive, collect or apply as interest under any such Note or any Loan Document, or otherwise, any amount in excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law, and, in the event that the Administrative Agent receives, collects or applies as interest any such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of such Note, and, if the principal balance of such Note is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to the Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the highest lawful rate, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium, rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof, and (iii) spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of such Note so that the interest rate is uniform throughout such term; provided, that if all Obligations under the Notes and all Loan Documents are performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received
for
the actual term thereof exceeds the maximum lawful rate, the Administrative Agent shall refund to the Borrower the amount of such excess, or credit the amount of such excess against the aggregate unpaid principal balance of each of the Lenders' Notes on a pro rata basis based upon unpaid principal balances outstanding at the time in question.
SECTION 3.08    
Computation of Fees and Interest
.
(a)
All computations of fees and interest under this Agreement and, unless expressly provided for otherwise, under the other Loan Documents, shall be made (i) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the basis of a 360day year for the actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365day year, or 366-day year if applicable), and (ii) and with respect to all other amounts, on the basis of a 365 or 366day year, as applicable, for the actual days elapsed. Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.
49
(b)
Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
SECTION 3.09    
Payments by the Borrower
.
(a)
All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without setoff, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender or Lenders to which such payments are owed at the Administrative Agent's Principal Office, and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on the date specified herein. Any payment received by the Administrative Agent later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to the Fee Letters or
Sections 4.07(b)
or
5.01(a)
of this Agreement or any other amounts payable solely to any Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder for its own account) to the Lenders and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(b)
Whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be, provided that in the case of Interest Periods with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, if payment on the last day of such Interest Period would fall in another calendar month because the due date is not a Business Day, then such payment shall be due on the immediately preceding Business Day.
(c)
Notwithstanding the terms of
Section 12.09
of this Agreement, the Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent that any payment owed to such Lender is not paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent when due hereunder or under any other Loan Document, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.
(d)
Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from the Borrower before the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower has not so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date on which such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
    
50
    
SECTION 3.10    
Fees.
The Borrower shall pay those fees as set forth in the Fee Letters on or before the dates for payment for such fees set forth in the Fee Letters.
SECTION 3.11    
The Election of Approving Lenders to Continue Funding
.
(a)
If one or more Lenders (the 
Declining Lender
 or 
Declining Lenders
) provides the Administrative Agent with, and the Administrative Agent has actually received, a written Notice of Declining Lender in the Form of
Exhibit J
indicating that for reasons other than a Default that such Lenders have elected to thereafter not fund any Revolving Loans or Issue or participate in additional Letters of Credit, and in any such event any other Lender or Lenders do approve further Revolving Loans or the further Issuances of, or amendments to, Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders by 6:00 p.m. (New York City time) that same day.
(b)
If the Lender or Lenders which are not the Declining Lenders desire, in their full and absolute discretion, they may (on a pro rata basis, based on the Maximum Considered Limit of all Lenders that have elected to continue funding, as adjusted after such Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date) make the full amount of such requested Revolving Loan or Issue the requested Letter of Credit irrespective of the Declining Lenders' disapproval (in such case, the Lenders that elect to continue funding shall be referred to as the 
Approving Lenders
). In such event, from such date forward (the 
Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date
) (i) all subsequent Loans (which shall include any Continuations of any prior Loans) and Issuances or amendments of Letters of Credit (which shall include any extensions of any previously Issued Letters of Credit) shall be made unilaterally by the Approving Lenders and no Letter of Credit thereafter Issued (or extended), or Loans (including any such Continuations) related thereto shall be participated in by the Declining Lenders, and (ii) the Lenders' Aggregate Accommodations for each such Approving Lender shall be increased on the basis of each such Revolving Loan, and Issuance of a Letter of Credit, but in any event by an amount not more than its Pro Rata Share of the Declining Lender's Maximum Considered Limit (determined as of the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date).
(c)
A Lender that becomes a Declining Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender that becomes a Declining Lender shall not be considered a Swap Lender with respect to swap contracts entered into after the applicable Lender has become a Declining Lender. Accordingly, if a Swap Lender should enter into a Swap Contract with the Borrower after such Lender or its Affiliate that is a Lender has become a Declining Lender, the Borrower's obligations under such swap contract shall not be secured by the Collateral hereunder, and the Declining Lender or its Affiliate that is a Swap Lender shall not be entitled to any sharing of amounts pursuant to the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement with respect to such Swap Contracts entered into after it or its Affiliate that is a Lender has become a Declining Lender.
(d)
Until all Declining Lenders are fully repaid, repayments (including realizations from Collateral) shall be applied as follows:
51
(i)
For purposes of allocating repayments prior to the occurrence of a Sharing Event under the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement, all repayments of Revolving Loans shall be allocated among the Lenders according to the Pro Rata Share of each Lender as such Pro Rata Share existed on the day such Revolving Loan was made and the Administrative Agent shall apply such payment in chronological order of outstanding Obligations, oldest Obligation being repaid first. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 3.11
, in the event that a Letter of Credit is Issued hereunder prior to the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date and an L/C Advance is required to be made in respect of such Letter of Credit on or after the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date, each of the Declining Lenders who had originally purchased a participation in such Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section 4.01(b)
of this Agreement shall be required to fund, on a pro rata basis based upon its percentage of participation in the related Letter of Credit, its portion of such L/C Advance notwithstanding that such L/C Advance is being made after the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date and this
Section 3.11
shall survive any Declining Lenders' termination of its obligations under this Agreement so as to require enforcement of this obligation as against any Declining Lender.
(ii)
Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event under the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement and thereafter, repayments hereunder shall be allocated according to Section 2.01 of the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement.
SECTION 3.12    
Daylight Overdraft Loans
.
(a)
From time to time, subject to approval of the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, the Borrower may request that the Daylight Overdraft Bank pay certain accounts payable of the Borrower on a Business Day notwithstanding that the Accounts of the Borrower contain insufficient funds to make such payment on such Business Day. To cover payment of any such account payable prior to collection thereof, the Daylight Overdraft Bank may, in its sole discretion on an UNCOMMITTED AND ABSOLUTELY DISCRETIONARY basis, and without any obligation to do so, elect to make a Daylight Overdraft Loan by debiting the amount thereof to an account of the Borrower at the Daylight Overdraft Bank in which the Collateral Agent shall have been granted a security interest notwithstanding that sufficient collected funds are not available in such account to cover such payment, provided that after giving effect to any Daylight Overdraft Loan requested:
(i)
the aggregate principal amount of all Daylight Overdraft Loans outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the Daylight Overdraft Sublimit; and
(ii)
the Aggregate Outstanding Extensions of Credit (taking into account any new Daylight Overdraft Loans), shall not exceed the lesser of (1) the Maximum Availability Amount then in effect or (2) the Collateral Pool;
(iii)
the Combined Facilities Aggregate Outstanding Extensions of Credit (taking into account any new Daylight Overdraft Loans), shall not exceed
52
the least of (1) Combined Facilities Maximum Amount then in effect, (2) the Collateral Pool, or (3) $700,000,000; and
(iv)
the Daylight Overdraft Loans may be used only (i) to refinance reimbursement obligations owed to any Letter of Credit Issuer after a Letter of Credit Issuer honors a payment under a Letter of Credit at settlement, and (ii) to finance payments to be made from the related deposit account of the Borrower held with the Administrative Agent, so long as the proceeds of Eligible Accounts Receivable covering the same are reasonably expected to be received on the day such Daylight Overdraft Loan is made.
(b)
THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE DAYLIGHT OVERDRAFT BANK HAS NO DUTY TO FUND ANY DAYLIGHT OVERDRAFT LOAN REQUESTED BY THE BORROWER BUT THAT THE DAYLIGHT OVERDRAFT BANK WILL EVALUATE EACH LOAN REQUEST AND IN ITS ABSOLUTE AND SOLE DISCRETION WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO FUND SUCH LOAN REQUEST.
(c)
To the extent that any Daylight Overdraft Loan is not repaid at the end of any Business Day, the Administrative Agent may, on or after the immediately following Business Day, effect repayment of the unpaid amount of such Daylight Overdraft Loan as follows:
(i)
Without any request therefor from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent may make a Swing Line Loan to the Borrower on behalf of the Swing Line Lender, the proceeds of which shall be applied to repay all or a portion of the unpaid amount of such Daylight Overdraft Loan. Upon making such Loan, the Administrative Agent will send notice thereof to the Borrower and the Swing Line Lender, whereupon the Swing Line Lender shall fund such Swing Line Loan without offset, deduction or counterclaim.
(ii)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that all or any portion of such Swing Line Loan may not be (A) legally made by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower for any other reason (including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Borrower), or (B) made by the Administrative Agent because any of the conditions precedent to the making of a Loan pursuant to
Section 6.02
of this Agreement were not fulfilled as of the date such Swing Line Loan would otherwise have been made, each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased a participation interest in the unpaid amount of such Daylight Overdraft Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof and shall fund the amount of such participation interest to the Administrative Agent ON DEMAND. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received a Notice of Declining Lender from one or more Lenders one (1) Business Day prior to the Administrative Agent's receipt of any Borrowing Request (in which event the provisions of
Section 3.11
of this Agreement hereof shall be applicable), each Lender will immediately transfer to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation, and the
53
proceeds of such participation shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Daylight Overdraft Bank, to such extent as will reduce the amount of the participating interest retained by the Daylight Overdraft Bank in its Daylight Overdraft Loans.
(iii)
Each Lender purchasing a participating interest in Daylight Overdraft Loans under this
Section 3.12(c)
shall have the same rights as a Lender under this Agreement. In the event any Lender fails to make available to a Daylight Overdraft Bank the amount of any such Lender's participation as provided in this
Section 3.12(c)
, the Daylight Overdraft Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest at the customary rate set by the Daylight Overdraft Bank for correction of errors among banks for one (1) Business Day and thereafter.
(d)
Each Lender's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to
Section 3.12(c)
of this Agreement hereof shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or the Borrower may have against the Daylight Overdraft Bank, the Borrower or any other Person, as the case may be, for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the Borrower or any Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
(e)
Unless and until each Daylight Overdraft Loan is repaid from the proceeds of a Loan or otherwise, each such Daylight Overdraft Loan shall constitute a Loan from the Daylight Overdraft Bank to the Borrower which is payable ON DEMAND, which bears interest at the Alternative Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Margin
plus
0.50% per annum, and which shall otherwise be entitled to all of the benefits of, and the security provided for in, the Loan Documents.
(f)
Each of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.02
of this Agreement shall be fully applicable to any Daylight Overdraft Loans except to the extent expressly stated to the contrary in this
Section 3.12
.
(g)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, (i) the Daylight Overdraft Loans (including any Daylight Overdraft Loan converted into a Swing Line Loan pursuant to
Section 3.12(c)(i)
of this Agreement) shall rank pari passu with all other senior debt of the Borrower and shall be secured by the Collateral, and (ii) unless and until each Daylight Overdraft Loan (including any Daylight Overdraft Loan converted into a Swing Line Loan pursuant to
Section 3.12(c)(i)
of this Agreement) is funded by payment from the Swing Line Lender to the Administrative Agent, any and all payments by the Borrower in respect of any Daylight Overdraft Loan (including any Daylight Overdraft Loan converted into a Loan pursuant to
Section 3.12(c)(i)
of this Agreement) shall be made to the Administrative Agent solely for the benefit of the Daylight Overdraft Bank.
54
(h)
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Daylight Overdraft Bank may, in its sole discretion, require such Defaulting Lender or, in the event such Defaulting Lender fails to do so, require the Borrower to deposit Cash Collateral with the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount equal to such Defaulting Lender participations in any requested or outstanding Daylight Overdraft Loans, a first priority security interest in which Cash Collateral is hereby granted in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the sole benefit of the Daylight Overdraft Bank. In the event that such Defaulting Lender fails to deposit Cash Collateral as required hereby and the Borrower is required to do so, the Borrower may, at any time thereafter, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to such Defaulting Lender, require that such Defaulting Lender terminate its obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and transfer all of its Lender's Aggregate Accommodations to one or more of the existing Lenders(upon their consent to accept such accommodations) or to one or more new Lenders acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if such transferee Lenders can be found.
SECTION 3.13    
Swing Line Loans
.
(a)
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender may, in its sole discretion on an UNCOMMITTED AND ABSOLUTELY DISCRETIONARY basis, and without any obligation to do so, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, make one or more Swing Line Loans to the Borrower from time to time from the Closing Date to the last Business Day prior to the Expiration Date, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not exceed the Swing Line Sublimit;
provided
,
however
, that (i) each Swing Line Loan shall be deemed to reduce the Maximum Lender Pro Rata Share Limit of each Lender, as set forth on
Schedule 1.01
hereto, by such Lender's pro rata portion of the amount of such Swing Line Loan; and (ii) each Swing Line Loan shall mature and be repaid on the related Swing Line Maturity Date; and provided, further, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan requested:
(i)
the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line Loans outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the Swing Line Sublimit;
(ii)
the Aggregate Outstanding Extensions of Credit (taking into account any new Swing Line Loans), shall not exceed the lesser of (1) the Maximum Availability Amount then in effect or (2) the Collateral Pool; and
(iii)
the Combined Facilities Aggregate Outstanding Extensions of Credit (taking into account any new Swing Line Loans), shall not exceed the least of (1) Combined Facilities Maximum Amount then in effect, (2) the Collateral Pool, or (3) $700,000,000.
(b)
THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NO SWING LINE LENDER HAS ANY DUTY TO FUND ANY SWING LINE LOAN REQUESTED BY THE BORROWER BUT THAT THE SWING LINE LENDER WILL
55
EVALUATE EACH LOAN REQUEST AND IN ITS ABSOLUTE AND SOLE DISCRETION WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO FUND SUCH LOAN REQUEST.
(c)
In no event may Swing Line Loans be borrowed hereunder if (i) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders specifying that a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) such Default or Event of Default shall not have been subsequently cured or waived. All Swing Line Loans shall bear interest at the Alternative Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Margin
plus
0.50% per annum, and may not be converted to Loans of a different Type. Swing Line Loans shall be made by the Swing Line Lenders pro rata in accordance with the relative amounts of their Maximum Lender Pro Rata Share Limits which, after giving effect to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.13
, are available for the making of Swing Line Loans. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, repay, prepay and reborrow Swing Line Loans under this
Section 3.13
.
(d)
To request a Swing Line Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swing Line Loan;
provided
,
however
, that the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender may, in their sole and absolute discretion, consider requests for Swing Line Loans received after 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swing Line Loan. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender of a written Borrowing Request in the form of
Exhibit B
hereof. If no date of issuance for such Swing Line Loan is specified, then the date of issuance of such Swing Line Loan shall be assumed to be the date of the Borrowing Request. If no maturity date for such Swing Line Loan is specified, then the maturity date for such Swing Line Loan shall be assumed to be the third (3
rd
) Business Day following the date of the Borrowing Request.
(e)
If, for any reason a Swing Line Loan is not repaid on the applicable Swing Line Maturity Date, the Administrative Agent may, on or after the immediately following Business Day, effect repayment of the unpaid amount of such Swing Line Loan as follows:
(i)
Without any request therefor from the Borrower or the consent of any Lender, the Administrative Agent may make a Revolving Loan to the Borrower on behalf of the Lenders, the proceeds of which shall be applied to repay all or a portion of the unpaid amount of such Swing Line Loan. Upon making such Revolving Loan, the Administrative Agent will send notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon each Lender (including the Swing Line Lender to the extent that it is also a Lender) shall immediately and automatically be deemed to have purchased and received from the Swing Line Lender, in each case irrevocably and without any further action by any party, an undivided interest and participation in such Revolving Loan and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect thereof, in an amount equal to its
56
Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Loan, and shall fund its respective Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Loan without offset, deduction or counterclaim.
(ii)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that all or any portion of such Revolving Loan may not be (A) legally made by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower for any reason (including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Borrower), or (B) made by the Administrative Agent because any of the conditions precedent to the making of a Revolving Loan pursuant to
Section 6.02
of this Agreement could not be fulfilled as of the date such Revolving Loan would otherwise have been made, each Lender severally, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that it shall, without regard to the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, purchase a participating interest in such Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to such Lender's pro rata share of such Swing Line Loan. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received a Notice of Declining Lender from one or more Lenders one (1) Business Day prior to the Administrative Agent's receipt of any Borrowing Request (in which event the provisions of
Section 3.11
of this Agreement hereof shall be applicable), each Lender will immediately transfer to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation, and the proceeds of such participation shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Swing Line Lender, to such extent as will reduce the amount of the participating interest retained by the Swing Line Lender in its Swing Line Loans.
(iii)
Each Lender purchasing a participating interest in Swing Line Loans under
Section 3.13(e)(ii)
of this Agreement shall have the same rights as a Lender under this Agreement. In the event any Lender fails to make available to a Swing Line Lender the amount of any such Lender's participation as provided in this
Section 3.13(e)
, the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest at the customary rate set by the Swing Line Lender for correction of errors among banks for one (1) Business Day and thereafter.
(f)
Each Lender's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to
Section 3.13(e)
of this Agreement hereof shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or the Borrower may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person, as the case may be, for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the Borrower or any Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
(g)
Unless and until each Swing Line Loan is repaid to the Swing Line Lender, each such Swing Line Loan shall constitute a Loan from the Swing Line Lender to the Borrower which is payable on the applicable Swing Line Maturity Date or on
57
demand, whichever is earlier, which bears interest at the Alternative Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Margin
plus
0.50% per annum and which shall otherwise be entitled to all of the benefits of, and the security provided for in, the Loan Documents.
(h)
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Swing Line Lender may, in its sole discretion, require such Defaulting Lender or, in the event such Defaulting Lender fails to do so, require the Borrower to deposit Cash Collateral with the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount equal to such Defaulting Lender participations in any requested or outstanding Swing Line Loans, a first priority security interest in which Cash Collateral is hereby granted in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the sole benefit of the Swing Line Lender. In the event that such Defaulting Lender fails to deposit Cash Collateral as required hereby and the Borrower is required to do so, the Borrower may, at any time thereafter, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to such Defaulting Lender, require that such Defaulting Lender terminate its obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and transfer all of its Lender's Aggregate Accommodations to one or more of the existing Lenders(upon their consent to accept such accommodations) or to one or more new Lenders acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if such transferee Lenders can be found.
(i)
Each of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.02
of this Agreement shall be fully applicable to any Swing Line Loans except to the extent expressly stated to the contrary in this
Section 3.13
of this Agreement.
(j)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, (i) the Swing Line Loans shall rank pari passu with all other senior debt of the Borrower and shall be secured by the Collateral, and (ii) unless and until each Swing Line Loan is funded by payment from the Lenders to the Administrative Agent, any and all payments by the Borrower in respect of any Swing Line Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent solely for the benefit of the Swing Line Lender.
(k)
Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event under the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement and thereafter, repayments hereunder shall be allocated according to Section 2.01 of the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement.
SECTION 3.14    
Collection Account; Instructions to Account Debtors and Other Payors
.
(a)
A Cash Collateral Account (each, a 
Collection Account
) shall be established and maintained by the Borrower with the Administrative Agent for the purpose of (i) receiving all payments in respect of Accounts, and (ii) making all payments relating to any Letter of Credit and trade accounts payable. Such account shall be subject to a deposit account control agreement satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(b)
The Borrower shall irrevocably instruct all Account Debtors in writing to remit payments in respect of all Accounts to a Collection Account or such other account as the Administrative Agent shall designate;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that an Account is subject to credit enhancement provided by a Lender that requires payment at
58
such Lender's counter and such Account has been discounted, such Account may be paid at such Lender's counter to the extent that any such discounted amount has been paid to a Collection Account. As of the Closing Date, and thereafter within fifteen (15) days of the initiation of any new relationship that would require additional notices to be sent in compliance herewith, the Borrower shall have provided notification of the security interest of the Collateral Agent to all such Account Debtors, letter of credit issuing banks in respect of which the Borrower is a beneficiary of the related letter of credit and all bailees holding inventory of the Borrower at third party warehouses or other storage locations that are not part of Borrower's premises, each such notification to be in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

No Letter of Credit Issuer shall Issue any Letter of Credit unless an authorized officer of the Administrative Agent shall have consented to the Issuance of such Letter of Credit in writing. Each Letter of Credit Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the Issuance of any Letter of Credit. No such Issuance will be made if, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the proposed date of Issuance, the Administrative Agent has received a written Notice of Declining Lender (unless a Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date has occurred with respect to such Declining Lenders). If the Administrative Agent does receive a written Notice of Declining Lender on a timely basis (and no Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date has occurred with respect to such Declining Lender), the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Letter of Credit Issuer by 6:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day of the proposed date of Issuance, and the proposed Letter of Credit will not be Issued, unless one or more of the Lenders have elected to become Approving Lenders thereby triggering the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date. If the Approving Lenders elect to Issue the Letter of Credit in the absence of a Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date notwithstanding the

No Letter of Credit shall in any event have an expiration date later than 180 days after the Expiration Date and the aggregate Face Amount of Letters of Credit with expiration dates after the Expiration Date shall not exceed $125,000,000.
(b)
Immediately and automatically upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Letter of Credit Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other participating Lender, and each such Lender shall be deemed to have purchased and received from such Letter of Credit Issuer, in each case irrevocably and without any further action by any party, an undivided interest and participation in such Letter of Credit, each drawing thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect thereof, in an amount, subject to
Section 3.11
of this Agreement, equal to the product of (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Maximum Lender Pro Rata Share Limit of such Lender and the denominator of which is the Maximum Availability Amount, times (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (assuming compliance with all conditions to drawing).
(c)

In the event that such Defaulting Lender fails to deposit Cash Collateral as required hereby and the Borrower is required to do so, the Borrower may, at any time thereafter, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to such Defaulting Lender, require that such Defaulting Lender terminate its obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and transfer all of its Lender's Aggregate Accommodations to one or more of the existing Lenders (upon their consent to accept such accommodations) or to one or more new Lenders acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if such transferee Lenders can be found.
(d)
No Letter of Credit Issuer is under any obligation to consider any Issuance unless such Letter of Credit Issuer shall have consented to such Issuance in its sole discretion. No Letter of Credit Issuer shall, in any event, make any Issuance if:
(i)
any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Letter of Credit

Section 2.01
or

at any time the outstanding aggregate available Face Amount of any Letters of Credit shall exceed any sublimit applicable to such Letters of Credit pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.03
of this Agreement;
(ix)

SECTION 4.02    
Amendment and Renewal of Letters of Credit

(a)
From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding, prior to the Expiration Date and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 4.01(d)
of this Agreement, the Borrower may request the Issuance of an amendment to a Letter of Credit, by giving the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer a Letter of Credit Request, and simultaneously giving the Administrative Agent and each other Lender a copy thereof, on the Business Day of the requested Issuance of such amendment to a Letter of Credit. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 4.01(d)
of this Agreement, on an UNCOMMITTED AND ABSOLUTELY DISCRETIONARY basis and on the terms and conditions set forth therein, each Letter of Credit Issuer will, upon receipt by such Letter of Credit Issuer of such a Letter of Credit Request on the Business Day of the proposed date of amendment, consider the Issuance of an amendment of any Letter of Credit Issued by it. Any such Letter of Credit Request for an amendment received by a Letter of Credit Issuer or the Administrative Agent
later than 12:00 noon, New York time, shall be deemed to have been received thereby at the opening of business on the next Business Day;
provided
,
however
, that the Administrative Agent and the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer may, in their sole and absolute discretion, consider requests for amendments to Letters of Credit received after 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed amendment, so long as such amendment is not for the increase of the Face Amount of a Letter of Credit or for the extension of the expiry of a Letter of Credit.
Each such request for an amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile or other electronic means acceptable to the Administrative Agent, shall be irrevocable and shall be effective upon receipt by such Letter of Credit Issuer or the Administrative Agent. Each such request for amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made accompanied by an L/C Amendment Application and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to such Letter of Credit Issuer: (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (ii) the proposed date of amendment of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (iv) such other matters as such Letter of Credit Issuer may require.

Each Letter of Credit Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and each other Lender as to the Issuance of an amendment to any Letter of Credit. No such Issuance will be made for the increase of the Face Amount of a Letter of Credit or for the extension of the expiry of a Letter of Credit if, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the proposed Business Day of Issuance, the Administrative Agent has received a written Notice of Declining Lender (unless a Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date has occurred with respect to such Declining Lenders).

62
Declining Lender), the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Letter of Credit Issuer by 6:00 p.m., New York time, time on the Business Day of the proposed date of Issuance, and any such proposed amendment to a Letter of Credit will not be Issued, unless one or more of the Lenders have elected to become Approving Lenders thereby triggering the Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date. If the Approving Lenders elect to Issue the amendment to a Letter of Credit for the increase of the Face Amount of a Letter of Credit or for the extension of the expiry of a Letter of Credit in the absence of a Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date notwithstanding the Administrative Agent's receipt of such Notice of Declining Lender, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall (on a pro rata basis among the Approving Lenders) Issue the amendment increasing the applicable Letter of Credit by the full amount of such requested amendment or extending the expiry of the applicable Letter of Credit;
provided
,
however
, that if such Letter of Credit Issuer shall not be able to Issue the amendment increasing the applicable Letter of Credit by the full amount of such requested amendment or extending the expiry of the applicable Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall not issue such amendment and neither such Letter of Credit Issuer nor any Lender shall be considered a Declining Lender (other than the Lender having issued a Notice of Declining Lender) or Defaulting Lender as a result of such Letter of Credit Issuer not having Issued such amendment.
(b)
Each Letter of Credit Issuer agrees that, while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and prior to the Expiration Date, at the option of the Borrower and upon the written request of the Borrower received by such Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent on the Business Day of the proposed date of notification of renewal, no later than 12:00 p.m., New York time, unless a Lender has provided the Administrative Agent with, and the Administrative Agent has actually received, a Notice of Declining Lender by 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the proposed date of renewal (and no Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date has occurred with respect to such Declining Lender), such Letter of Credit Issuer shall be entitled to authorize the renewal of any Letter of Credit Issued by it. Each such request for renewal of a Letter of Credit made by the Borrower shall be made by facsimile or other electronic means acceptable to the Administrative Agent, accompanied by an L/C Amendment Application, and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to such Letter of Credit Issuer and the Lenders: (i) the Letter of Credit to be renewed; (ii) the proposed date of renewal of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the revised expiration date of the Letter of Credit; and (iv) such other matters as such Letter of Credit Issuer may require. Neither such Letter of Credit Issuer nor the Lenders participating therein shall be under any obligation so to renew any Letter of Credit.
(c)
If any outstanding Letter of Credit Issued by a Letter of Credit Issuer shall provide that it shall be automatically renewed unless the beneficiary thereof receives notice from such Letter of Credit Issuer that such Letter of Credit shall not be renewed, and if at the time of renewal such Letter of Credit Issuer would be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal of such Letter of Credit in accordance with this
Section 4.02(c)
, then unless, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day immediately
63
preceding the last date for such Letter of Credit Issuer to provide notice to the beneficiary of non-renewal, the Administrative Agent has received either (i) written notice from the Borrower, copied to the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer, directing that such Letter of Credit not be renewed, or (ii) a written Notice of Declining Lender (unless a Conversion to Approving Lenders Funding Date has occurred with respect to such Declining Lenders), such Letter of Credit Issuer shall be permitted to allow such Letter of Credit to renew, and the Borrower and each Lender hereby authorize such renewal, and, accordingly, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall be deemed to have received an L/C Amendment Application requesting such renewal.
(d)
Each Letter of Credit Issuer may, with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, deliver any notices of non-renewal or other communications to any Letter of Credit beneficiary or transferee or take any other action as necessary or appropriate, at any time and from time to time, in order to cause the expiration date of such Letter of Credit to be a date not later than the Expiration Date (
provided
,
however
, that no Letter of Credit Issuer may take any action that would result in the expiration date of such Letter of Credit in the case of Letters of Credit with expiry dates after the Expiration Date being earlier than the current expiration date thereof, so long as such Letter of Credit is otherwise in compliance with the last sentence of
Section 4.01(a)
of this Agreement).
(e)

SECTION 4.03    
Drawings and Reimbursements

(a)
Not later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on the day of any drawing under any Letter of Credit (or in the event that such drawing shall occur after 10:00 a.m. on such day, or the Borrower shall not have received notice of such drawing prior to 10:00 a.m. on such day, the immediately succeeding Business Day), the Borrower will pay to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer an amount equal to the amount so drawn. Any amount of such a drawing that is not reimbursed when due will be automatically and without further action be converted to a Loan in the amount of such drawing, which Loan shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate for an Interest Period of one month unless a timely Borrowing Request shall have been received by the Administrative Agent requesting a different rate and/or Interest Period.
(b)
In the event that a drawing under any Letter of Credit is not reimbursed by the Borrower by the time specified in
Section 4.03(a)
of this Agreement, the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer will promptly so notify the Administrative Agent, which will promptly so notify each other Lender. Each such Lender will then, on the Business Day of such notification, make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer, at the Administrative Agent's Principal Office, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the amount of such Lender's participation in such
64
drawing, to reimburse such Letter of Credit Issuer for the applicable portion of such drawing. The amount of such reimbursement to such Letter of Credit Issuer shall also be deemed to be each such Lender's share of the related Loan occurring as a result of such non-payment by the Borrower. In the event that any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer the amount required pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 4.03(b)
of this Agreement, the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer will be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate.
(c)
In the event that a Loan shall be required to be made as a result of failure to make reimbursement with respect to any Letter of Credit, all conditions precedent to a Borrowing hereunder shall be required to be satisfied, including, the provisions of
Section 3.05
of this Agreement.

(b)

(c)
The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) any Letter of Credit Issuer
65
may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary; and (ii) no Letter of Credit Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which appears on its face to be in order but may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

Section 4.06
of this Agreement no longer are continuing, or (y) the obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders covered thereby have been indefeasibly repaid or otherwise reduced by the Borrower by the amount of such repayment or reduction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, unless the Expiration Date has been
67
extended on or before the date that such Expiration Date is to occur or the Borrower has previously provided Cash Collateral in accordance with the terms of this
Section 4.06
, the Borrower shall deposit into a deposit account of the Borrower held at the Collateral Agent in which the Collateral Agent has been granted a first priority (subject to Permitted Liens) perfected security interest, cash collateral in an amount sufficient to cover one hundred and five percent (105%) of the sum of (I) the aggregate undrawn Face Amount of all Letters of Credit and all unpaid fees related thereto and (II) the aggregate amount of any drawings under outstanding Letters of Credit which have not yet been reimbursed by the Borrower to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer as of such Expiration Date.

SECTION 5.01    
Additional Costs
.
(a)
If, after the date hereof, any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation or Regulatory Change or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration thereof either (a) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special-deposit or similar requirement against loans, letters of credit, guaranties, or other extensions of credit made or issued by or participated in, or assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender or (b) imposes on any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender any other condition regarding this Agreement, such Letter of Credit Issuer, such Lender or any Letter of Credit, and the result of any event referred to in the preceding clause (a) or (b) is to increase the cost to any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining any participation therein, then, upon demand by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender through the
69
Administrative Agent, the Borrower will pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender through the Administrative Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender for such increased cost and such Letter of Credit Issuer or Lender as of such date may, at the Borrower's option, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent and such Letter of Credit Issuer or Lender, be treated as a Declining Lender pursuant to
Section 3.11
of this Agreement. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost (including reasonable detail concerning the basis therefor), submitted to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to each Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any increase in costs that are attributable to its making or maintaining of any Alternative Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to make any Alternative Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called 
Additional Costs
), resulting from any Regulatory Change that:
(i)
shall subject any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans) to any tax, duty or other charge in respect of such Loans or its Notes or changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or its Note in respect of any of such Loans (excluding changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or of such Applicable Lending Office by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or such Applicable Lending Office); or
(ii)
imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements (including any Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the Alternative Base Rate for such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender (including any of such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition of Alternative Base Rate in
Section 1.01
of this Agreement), or any uncommitted obligation of such Lender (including the uncommitted obligations of such Lender hereunder); or
(iii)
imposes any other condition (other than addressed in
Section 5.07
of this Agreement) affecting this Agreement or its Note (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities).
If any Lender requests compensation from the Borrower under this
Section 5.01(a)
of this Agreement, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender thereafter to make or Continue Alternative Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate Loans or to Convert Eurodollar Rate Loans into Alternative Base Rate Loans or vice versa, until the Regulatory Change giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of
Section 5.04
of
70
this Agreement shall be applicable),
provided
,
however
, that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.
(b)
Without limiting the effect of the provisions of
Section 5.01(a)
of this Agreement, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Alternative Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes Alternative Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Eurodollar Rate Loans into, Alternative Base Rate Loans hereunder (or vice versa) shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of
Section 5.04
of this Agreement shall be applicable) and such Lender as of such date may, at the Borrower's option, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, be treated as a Declining Lender pursuant to
Section 3.11
of this Agreement.
(c)
Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.01
(but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay directly to each Lender from time to time on request such amounts as such Lender may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender (or, without duplication, the bank holding company or other holding company of which such Lender is a subsidiary) for any costs (which increases in cost, or reductions in amount receivable, shall be the result of such Lender's or holding company's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such increases or reductions resulting from such event) that are attributable to the maintenance by such Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company or other holding company), pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) of any court or governmental or monetary authority implemented after the date hereof following any Regulatory Change, including without limitation instituting any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by any government or governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the national level the Basel Accord (including the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 C.F.R. Part 208, Appendix A; 12 C.F.R. Part 225, Appendix A) and the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (12 C.F.R. Part 3, Appendix A)), of capital in respect of its Loans (such compensation to include an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on assets or equity of such Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company or other holding company) to a level below that which such Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company or other holding company) could have achieved but for such law, regulation, interpretation, directive or request).
71
(d)
Each Lender shall notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the date hereof entitling such Lender to compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this
Section 5.01
as promptly as practicable;
provided
,
however
, that each Lender will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loans of such Lender affected by such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the opinion of such Lender, be disadvantageous to such Lender, and (iii) each affected Lender shall use best efforts to take other measures as such Lender may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this
Section 5.01
would be materially reduced. Each Lender will furnish to the Borrower a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender for compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this
Section 5.01
. Determinations and allocations by any Lender for purposes of this
Section 5.01
of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section 5.01
, or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Section 5.01
, on its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to compensate such Lender under this
Section 5.01
, shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable basis and do not evidence manifest error.
(e)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 5.01
, no Additional Costs shall be payable to any Lender to the extent that such Additional Costs result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender.
SECTION 5.02    
Inability to Determine Interest Rate
.
(a)
If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
(i)
the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the relevant Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or
(ii)
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders and from the Facility B Lenders with greater than fifty percent (50%) of the maximum considered limits under Facility B that the relevant Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their affected Revolving Loans, or to the extent applicable, if ever, the Facility B Lenders from making or maintaining affected loans under Facility B, during such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower, and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.
72
(b)
If such notice is given with respect to the Eurodollar Rate applicable to Revolving Loans, (i) any such Eurodollar Rate Loan requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall instead bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of (1) the Alternative Base Rate or (2) a rate per annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next 1/16
th
of 1%) equal to the rate of interest for the applicable Interest Period quoted on or about the commencement of such Interest Period by the Administrative Agent as its cost of funds for the Credit Extension for such Interest Period, as determined solely by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion, which determination may include, without limitation, such factors as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate from time to time, including, without limitation, market, regulatory, and liquidity conditions, (ii) any Alternative Base Rate Loan that was to have been Converted on the first day of such Interest Period to an Eurodollar Rate Loan shall continue as an Alternative Base Rate Loan, and (iii) any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be converted as set forth in
subclause (2)
of
clause (i)
of this
Section 5.02(b)
on the first day of such Interest Period. Until such notice has been revoked by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made or Continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to Convert Alternative Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans.
(c)
The Administrative Agent shall promptly revoke (i) any such notice pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 5.02
if the Administrative Agent determines that the relevant circumstances have ceased to exist and (ii) any such notice pursuant to
clause (a)(ii)
of this
Section 5.02
upon receipt of notice from the Required Lenders that the relevant circumstances described in such
clause (a)(ii)
of this
Section 5.02
have ceased to exist.
SECTION 5.03    
Illegality
.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder (and, in the opinion of such Lender, the designation of a different Applicable Lending Office would either not avoid such unlawfulness or would be disadvantageous to such Lender), then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and such Lender's obligation to consider making or Continuing, or to Converting Loans of any other Type into, Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be (in which case the provisions of
Section 5.04
of this Agreement shall be applicable) and such Lender as of such date may, at the Borrower's option, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, be treated as a Declining Lender pursuant to
Section 3.11
of this Agreement.
SECTION 5.04    
Treatment of Affected Loans
.
If the obligation of any Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Alternative Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended pursuant to
Section 5.01
or
5.03
hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be automatically Converted into Alternative Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be (or, in the case of a Conversion
73
required by
Section 5.01(b)
or
5.03
of this Agreement, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in
Section 5.01
or
5.03
of this Agreement that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
(a)
to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Loans, as applicable, shall be applied instead to its Alternative Base Rate Loans; and
(b)
all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be made or Continued instead as Alternative Base Rate Loans, and all Alternative Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall remain as Alternative Base Rate Loans.
If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent that the circumstances specified in
Section 5.01
or
5.03
of this Agreement that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, pursuant to this
Section 5.04
no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Rate Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lender's Alternative Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective uncommitted obligations hereunder.
SECTION 5.05    
Compensation
.
The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense that such Lender determines is attributable to:
(a)
any payment, mandatory or optional prepayment or Conversion of an Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender for any reason (including the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to
Article X
of this Agreement) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or
(b)
any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including the failure of any of the conditions precedent specified in
Section 6.01
of this Agreement to be satisfied) to (i) borrow, convert into or continue an Eurodollar Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant Borrowing Request given pursuant to
Section 3.03
hereof, or (ii) prepay an Eurodollar Rate Loan from such Lender on the date for such prepayment specified in the relevant notice of prepayment given pursuant to
Section 3.04

Section 5.05
.
SECTION 5.06    
Compensation of Lenders
.
If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 5.01
, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 5.07
, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, at its sole expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 12.08
), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
,
however
, that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in any payment made by any Letter of Credit Issuer in respect of any Letter of Credit, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 5.01
or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 5.07
, such assignment will result in the elimination of such additional compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 5.07    
Taxes
.
(a)
Any and all payments by the Borrower to any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall (except to the extent required by law) be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrower shall pay all Other Taxes.
(b)
The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, the Administrative Agent and each Letter of Credit Issuer for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by such Lender, Administrative Agent or such Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Administrative Agent makes written demand therefore or the Expiration Date, which ever is earlier.
75
(c)
If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer then:
(i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Administrative Agent, Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made;
(ii)
the Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings; and
(iii)
the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(d)
Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Borrower of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)
If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, then the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Letter of Credit Issuer shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to (i) change the jurisdiction of its lending office or Letter of Credit issuing office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the judgment of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Letter of Credit Issuer is not otherwise disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Letter of Credit Issuer, and (ii) use its best efforts to take such other measures as the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Letter of Credit Issuer may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section would be materially reduced.
(f)
Each of the Administrative Agent and any Lender that is not incorporated or otherwise formed under the laws of the United States or a state thereof (a 
Non-U.S. Person
) agrees that it shall on the date it becomes a Lender or Administrative Agent hereunder, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (x) for the purpose of establishing foreign status and claiming that payments made to it hereunder are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, one duly completed and executed copy of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or replacement or successor form thereto), (y) for the purpose of establishing foreign status and exemption from, or a reduced rate of, withholding as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty, one duly completed and executed copy of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
76
(or replacement or successor form thereto), or (z) for the purpose of establishing the portfolio interest exemption from United States Federal withholding tax pursuant to Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, both (i) one duly completed and executed copy of a United States Internal Revenue Service Form W8BEN (or replacement or successor form thereto), and (ii) a certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Person is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower, and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code), in each case such documentation certifying that such Lender or the Administrative Agent is entitled to receive payments hereunder payable to it without deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income taxes, or subject to a reduced rate thereof;
provided
,
however
, that any Administrative Agent or Lender that is not the beneficial owner of a payment, as defined in Treasury Regulation  1.1441-1(c)(6), and therefore is unable to provide a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, may provide the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with (x) one duly completed and executed copy of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (in lieu of the Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI), and (y) all additional forms or certifications, as provided in Treasury Regulation  1.1441-1(e)(3), required to be attached to such Form W-8IMY, necessary to establish that the Administrative Agent or the Lender, in its capacity as an intermediary, is entitled to receive payments hereunder without deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income taxes, or subject to a reduced rate thereof. A Non-U.S. Person shall be required to furnish any such form or certificate only if it is entitled to claim an exemption from, or a reduced rate of, withholding.
(g)
If any Lender which is a Non-U.S. Person sells an assignment or participating interest pursuant to
Section 12.08
of this Agreement or otherwise ceases to own the beneficial interest in a all or a portion of its L/C Obligations or Loans (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.1441-1(c)(6)), such Lender shall, at the time of the sale of the beneficial interest, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with revised forms, reflecting the portion of its L/C Obligations and Loans which have been sold on one duly completed and executed copy of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or replacement or successor from thereto) and required attachments thereto, and that portion of its L/C Obligations and Loans retained on one duly completed and executed copy of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or replacement or successor form thereto).
(h)
Each of the Administrative Agent or any Lender that delivers to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent any such form or certification as required under this
Section 5.07
further undertakes to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent further copies of any such form or certification as required under this
Section 5.07
or other manner of certification reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower on or before the date that any such form or certification as required under this
Section 5.07
expires or becomes obsolete or the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms or certifications previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, certifying that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is entitled to receive payments hereunder without deduction
77
or withholding of any United States Federal income taxes, or subject to a reduced rate thereof except as otherwise provided in the next sentence. If at any time there has occurred, on or prior to the date on which any delivery of any such form or certification as required under this
Section 5.07

Section 3.10
of this Agreement and
Section 4.07
of this Agreement shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders' respective Pro Rata Share (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender's Maximum Considered Limit); and

Section 5.11(c)(ii)
, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit fees payable under

. The Borrower agrees that, subject to any mandatory requirements of applicable law then in effect, the Collateral Agent shall, in addition to any rights now or hereafter existing under applicable law, have all rights as a secured creditor under the UCC as in effect from time to time in all relevant jurisdictions and may, upon the occurrence of, and while such is continuing, an Event of Default:
(a)
    
personally, or by agents, receiver, manager or attorneys, immediately take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, from the Borrower or any other Person who then has possession of any part thereof with or without notice or process of law, and for that purpose may to the extent permitted by law enter upon the Borrower's premises where any of the Collateral is located and remove the same and, in connection with such removal, use any and all services, supplies, aids, and other facilities of the Borrower; and

- 10 -
SECTION 5.02
    
Remedies; Disposition of the Collateral
. Any Collateral repossessed by the Collateral Agent under or pursuant to
Section 5.01
herein, and any Collateral whether or not so repossessed by the Collateral Agent, may be sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of under one or more contracts, and without the necessity of gathering at the place of sale of the property to be sold, and in general in such manner, at such time or times, at such place or places and on such terms as the Collateral Agent may, in compliance with any mandatory requirements of applicable law, determine to be commercially reasonable. Any of the Collateral may be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of in the condition in which the same existed when taken by the Collateral Agent or after any processing, manufacturing, overhaul or repair which the Collateral Agent shall determine to be commercially reasonable. Any such disposition which shall be a private sale or other private proceeding permitted by such requirements shall be made upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Borrower specifying the time at which such disposition is to be made and the intended sale price or other consideration therefor. Unless specified otherwise in another Loan Document with respect to such Collateral, any such disposition which shall be a public sale permitted by such requirements shall be made upon not less than ten (10) days' written notice to the Borrower specifying the time and place of such sale and, in the absence of applicable requirements of law, shall be by public auction (which may, at the Collateral Agent's option, be subject to reserve), after publication of notice of such auction not less than ten (10) days prior thereto in at least two (2) newspapers in general circulation in the location where such Collateral is located or where it is customary to advertise auctions of such a type. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. To the extent permitted by any such requirement of law, the Collateral Agent on behalf of all of the Secured Parties may bid for and become the purchaser of the Collateral or any item thereof, offered for sale in accordance with this
Section 5.02
without accountability to the Borrower (except to the extent of surplus money received as provided in
Section 5.04
herein). If, under mandatory requirements of applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall be required to make disposition of the Collateral within a period of time which does not permit the giving of notice to the Borrower as hereinabove specified, the Collateral Agent need give the Borrower only such notice of disposition as shall be reasonably practicable in view of such mandatory requirements of applicable law.
SECTION 5.03
    
Waiver
. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTICE AND JUDICIAL HEARING IN CONNECTION WITH THE COLLATERAL AGENT'S TAKING POSSESSION OR THE COLLATERAL AGENT'S DISPOSITION OF ANY OF THE COLLATERAL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL PRIOR NOTICE AND HEARING FOR ANY PREJUDGMENT REMEDY OR REMEDIES AND ANY SUCH RIGHT WHICH ANY BORROWER WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OR ANY STATUTE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF ANY STATE, and the Borrower hereby further waives, to the extent permitted by law:
(a)
    
all damages occasioned by such taking of possession except any damages which are the direct result of the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct;
- 11 -
(b)
    
all other requirements as to the time, place and terms of sale or other requirements with respect to the enforcement of the Collateral Agent's rights hereunder, and
(c)
    
all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any applicable law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof; and the Borrower, for itself and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or they now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all such laws.
Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other realization upon, any Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand, either at law or in equity, of the Borrower therein and thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against the Borrower and against any and all Persons claiming or attempting to claim the Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof from, through and under the Borrower.
SECTION 5.04
    
Application of Proceeds
. The proceeds of any Collateral obtained pursuant to
Sections 3.03
or
5.01
herein or disposed of pursuant to
Section 5.02
herein may, in the discretion of the Collateral Agent to the extent permitted by law, be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the Obligations and/or then or at any time thereafter and applied in accordance with the Credit Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreements (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement).
SECTION 5.05
    
Remedies Cumulative
. No failure or delay on the part of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder, under any other Loan Document or Swap Contract (to which a Swap Lender is a party) and no course of dealing between the Borrower and the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder, under any other Loan Document or Swap Contract (to which a Swap Lender is a party) preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other Loan Document or Swap Contract (to which a Swap Lender is a party) expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any form shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
SECTION 5.06
    
Discontinuance of Proceedings
. In case the Collateral Agent shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this Agreement by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Collateral Agent then and in every such case the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and each Secured Party shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral subject to the security interest created under this Agreement, and all rights, remedies, and powers of the Collateral Agent shall continue as if no such proceeding had been instituted.

UNCOMMITED LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT
(Agreement)
Dear Sirs,
We are pleased to inform you that an uncommitted and secured revolver letter of credit facility (the "
Facility
") subject to a collateral pool (the 
Collateral Pool
 as defined in the Facility A Agreement, as defined below) in favour of Tesoro Panama Company, S.A. with registered office at c/o Arias, Fabrega & Fabrega, Plaza 2000, 16th Floor, 50th Street, Panama, Republic of Panama, a company validly and duly incorporated and existing under the laws of Panama has been approved by the credit committee of BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA, Geneva ("

The Facility is granted in connection with, and is subject to availability of, a credit facility made available by BNP Paribas New York Branch and other lenders (

Facility A Agreement
), executed by and among, inter alia, the Borrower and BNP Paribas New York Branch, as Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Facility A Agreement.

The duties of the BNP Paribas New York Branch (in its capacity as a collateral agent) and the Bank (in its capacity as a collateral agent), collectively, the 
Security Agents
, are set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (
Combined Facilities Intercreditor Agreement
) entered into by and between the Bank and BNP Paribas New York Branch for and on behalf of the Lenders under the Faciltiy A Agreement.
4. Facility Type:    
Uncommitted, revolving, secured collateral pool credit facility.
It is understood that the Bank is under no obligation whatsoever to issue Documentary Credits or to countersign LOIs or to make Advances and retains the right at its sole and absolute discretion to accept or reject any drawing requested by the Borrower at its sole and absolute discretion, notwithstanding whether the Conditions Precedent and Subsequent (Annex 1) are fulfilled and whether or not an Event of Default has occurred.
The Borrower intends to reimburse the Facility either:
(a) through drawings under Facility A; or
(b) the proceeds of receivables relating to the resale of Products.
The Facility is available through:
(c) the issuance of letters of credit and standby letters of credit (collectively "
Documentary Credits
") in favour of suppliers;
(d) countersignature of letters of indemnity ("
LOI
" as defined below) issued by the Borrower in favour of its buyers to which it sold Products or in favour of BNP Paribas New York Branch; and
"LOI"
shall mean the undertaking made by the Borrower, countersigned by the Bank, in favour of either
The Bank will only countersign a LOI if the relevant shipping documents are subject to a Documentary Credit issued by the Bank and will be presented to the Bank by the beneficiary.
To determine the Outstanding Amount hereunder:
(a)
Documentary Credits
are accounted for at the Banks net liability to the beneficiary, calculated on a daily basis (in particular owing to the impact of price fluctuation clauses contained in the Documentary Credit); and
(b)
    LOI
are accounted for at US$ 1 each.
The Borrower agrees that the Bank and BNP Paribas New York Branch may fully disclose and exchange any and all information and documentation in respect of this Facility and Facility A (including but not limited to the regular Collateral Pool Reports) and the Borrower releases the Bank and BNP Paribas New York Branch from all applicable banking secrecy and any other confidentiality obligations with respect to such mutual exchange of any information by the Bank and BNP Paribas New York Branch as contemplated by this Facility or Facility A.
Precedent and
(b)    delivery of a Collateral Pool Report evidencing that the Obligations (as defined in the Facility A Agreement) and all outstanding obligations hereunder (including contingent obligations) are not greater than the value of Collateral Pool.
Agreements:
(1) cash located in bank accounts at BNP Paribas New York Branch :
(2) all accounts receivable of the Borrower relating to the re-sale of Products;
(3) all investment and hedging accounts (to be held at approved brokers and subject to tripartite agreements),
(4) all inventory of the Borrower, whether in storage or in transit
(5) all bills of lading to the order of or endorsed to the order of either Agent or other documents evidencing the storage of Products such as tank warrants;
(6) any machinery and equipment of the Borrower;

(8) all contract rights of the Borrower;

The Borrower will be required under the transaction documents to maintain
satisfactory insurance on all tangible Pledged Collateral and other assets with respect to which the Collateral Agent (BNP Paribas New York Branch, in such capacity) shall be listed as additional insured or loss payee.
The Facility A Lenders, the Bank and the Swap Lenders will also enter into an intercreditor agreement or agreements (collectively, the
Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement)
governed by New York law for purposes of clarifying their respective rights with respect to the Pledged Collateral.
Should the Borrower not reimburse the same value (for example due to non-availability under Facility A), the Bank may at its full discretion agree to account amounts paid under the Documentary Credit as an advance (Advance) or insist on immediate reimbursement. If granted, such Advance is due for reimbursement no later than ten (10) Business Days after the day on which reimbursement was due as per the first paragraph of this section 12, or, if earlier on the Expiration Date.
Advances will be accounted as overdrafts (respectively as current account debt) and will bear interest at the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 2.75% per annum. Interest is compounded on quarterly basis (interest on interest). The same applies if the Bank refuses to grant an Advance and demands immediate reimbursement of amounts paid under Documentary Credits or LOI
(e) an Event of Default has occurred under the Facility A Agreement;
then
(1) the Borrower shall:
- procure that the liabilities and obligations of the Bank under all Documentary Credits and LOI are immediately reduced to zero and/or provide cash collateral within 1 Business Day from the receipt of the written demand in an amount specified by the Bank (up to the aggregate Face Amount of the Documentary Credits and LOI then outstanding);
- immediately reimburse all Advances (in principal, interest and commissions); and
and (2) the Bank shall be entitled to enforce its rights over the shipping documents (and apply the proceeds of such per the terms of the Combined Facilities Intercreditor Agreement and the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement to the outstanding amounts under this Facility and Facility A).
In the event that any Advance is not repaid when due, or in the event that any other amount payable hereunder is not paid within 5 days following the Bank's request, then the Bank has the right to claim from the Borrower in addition to the interest stipulated in Section 13 hereof a penalty interest on such amounts outstanding from time to time at a rate of 2% per annum.
The Bank will disclose to the Borrower the identity of each Participant and its share in the Facility.
The Borrower acknowledges that each issuance of a Documentary Credit or countersignature of LOI may be subject to prior approval of all such Participants, and accordingly such issuance may only occur at the earliest 24 hours (during business hours) after delivery of a suitable request for the Documentary Credit or LOI (as determined by the Bank) to such Participants. Equally the granting of an Advance may be subject to approval by such Participants.
The Bank may, with the consent of the Borrower in the event an Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing, assign all or any of its rights and benefits under the Facility, or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under the Facility to any other person or insure its risks under the Facility.
The Bank may, without the consent of the Borrower in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing assign all or any of its rights and benefits under the Facility or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under the Facility to any other person or insure its risks under the Facility.
For the above purposes, the Bank (and BNP Paribas New York Branch) may fully disclose and exchange any and all information and documentation in respect of this Facility and Facility A (including but not limited to the regular Collateral Pool Reports under Facility A) with potential Participants and assignees and the Borrower releases the Bank and BNP Paribas New York Branch from all applicable banking secrecy and any other confidentiality obligations as relating to such disclosures and exchanges with prospective participants and assignees.

Amendment no 2 to the
UNCOMMITED LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT
(Amendment no 2)
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the Uncommitted Letter of Credit Facility Agreement, dated 18 October 2010 (
Agreement
) and Amendment no 1 dated 4 February 2011 (
Amendment no 1
). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.
Please find below an overview of the agreed to amendments.
1. New Clauses 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 and 17
Clauses 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 and 17 of the Agreement (as amended by Amendment no 1) is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety by the following:
4. Facility Type:    
Uncommitted, revolving, secured collateral pool credit facility.
It is understood that the Bank is under no obligation whatsoever to issue Documentary Credits or to countersign LOIs or to make Cash Advances or Advances and retains the right at its sole and absolute discretion to accept or reject any drawing requested by the Borrower at its sole and absolute discretion, notwithstanding whether the Conditions Precedent and Subsequent (Annex 1) are fulfilled and whether or not an Event of Default has occurred.
The Borrower intends to reimburse the Facility either:
(a) through drawings under Facility A; or
(b) the proceeds of receivables relating to the resale of Products.
The Facility is available through:
(c) the issuance of letters of credit and standby letters of credit (collectively
Documentary Credits
) in favour of suppliers;
(d) countersignature of letters of indemnity (
LOI
 as defined below) issued by the Borrower in favour of its buyers to which it sold Products or in favour of BNP Paribas New York Branch;
Execution Copy
LOI
 shall mean the undertaking made by the Borrower, countersigned by the Bank, in favour of either
(i) a buyer to indemnify the same for all damages, losses and other costs such buyer may suffer arising from the fact that the Borrower is unable to timely deliver the relevant shipping documents to such buyer (the foregoing in order to induce the buyer to make payment for amounts due to the Borrower under the relevant sale contract); or
(ii) BNP Paribas New York Branch to indemnify the same for all damages, losses and other costs BNP Paribas New York Branch may suffer arising from the fact that the Borrower is unable to deliver the relevant shipping documents to BNP Paribas New York Branch (the foregoing in order to induce BNP Paribas New York Branch to approve a corresponding drawing under Facility A as per Section 5(a) above)
The Bank will only countersign a LOI if the relevant shipping documents are subject to a Documentary Credit issued by the Bank and will be presented to the Bank by the beneficiary.
(e) the disbursement of advances in cash
(Cash Advances
) paid directly to the suppliers.
To determine the Outstanding Amount hereunder:
(a)
Documentary Credits
are accounted for at the Banks net liability to the beneficiary, calculated on a daily basis (in particular owing to the impact of price fluctuation clauses contained in the Documentary Credit);
(b)
LOI
are accounted for at US$ 1 each;
10. Conditions         
Issuance of any Documentary Credit or countersignature of a LOI
or disbursement of any
Precedent and         
of any Cash Advance is subject to:
Subsequent:        
(a) completion of the General and Specific Conditions Precedent as per Annex 1;
Execution Copy
and;
(b) delivery of a Collateral Pool Report evidencing that the Obligations (as defined in the Facility A Agreement) and all outstanding obligations hereunder (including contingent obligations) are not greater than the value of Collateral Pool.
13. Repayment and     
Amounts paid by the Bank under Documentary Credits or LOI are due for reimbursement by the Borrower the same value day.
Maturity:        
Should the Borrower not reimburse the same value (for example due to non-availability under Facility A), the Bank may at its full discretion agree to account amounts paid under the Documentary Credit as an advance (
Advance
) or insist on immediate reimbursement. If granted, such Advance is due for reimbursement no later than ten (10) Business Days after the day on which reimbursement was due as per the first paragraph of this section 13, or, if earlier on the Expiration Date.
Cash Advances (and interest accrued) are due for reimbursement 45 days after disbursement.
Advances and Cash Advances will be accounted as overdrafts (respectively as current account debt) and will bear interest at the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 2.75% per annum. Interest is compounded on quarterly basis (interest on interest). The same applies if the Bank refuses to grant an Advance and demands immediate reimbursement of amounts paid under Documentary Credits or LOI.
16. Event of Default:    
If:
(a) any amount due under this Agreement is not paid at its maturity; or
(b) the Borrower breaches any material obligation hereunder or contained in any Security Agreement; or
(c) any material provision of this Agreement and in the Security Agreements is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any applicable jurisdiction; or
(d) the Borrower fails to provide any documents listed in the section Condition Subsequent upon reasonable request from the Bank; or
(e) an Event of Default has occurred under the Facility A Agreement; or
(f) Any representation or warranty by the Borrower made or deemed made herein or which is contained in any certificate or document prepared by the Borrower (including any Collateral Pool Report or schedule or attachment thereto), is false or misleading in any material respect on or as of the date made or deemed made;
then
(1) the Borrower shall:
- procure that the liabilities and obligations of the Bank under all Documentary Credits and LOI are immediately reduced to zero and/or provide cash collateral within 1 Business Day from the receipt of the written demand in an amount specified by the Bank (up to the aggregate Face Amount of the Documentary Credits and LOI then outstanding);
Execution Copy
and (2) the Bank shall be entitled to enforce its rights over the shipping documents (and apply the proceeds of such per the terms of the Combined Facilities Intercreditor Agreement and the Swap Lender Intercreditor Agreement to the outstanding amounts under this Facility and Facility A).
In the event that any Advance or Cash Advance is not repaid when due, or in the event that any other amount payable hereunder is not paid within 5 days following the Bank's request, then the Bank has the right to claim from the Borrower in addition to the interest stipulated in Section 13 hereof a penalty interest on such amounts outstanding from time to time at a rate of 2% per annum.
17. Sub-participation    
The Bank may, without the consent of the Borrower, enter into risk participation
The Bank will disclose to the Borrower the identity of each Participant and its share in the Facility.
The Borrower acknowledges that each issuance of a Documentary Credit or LOI or countersignature of LOI may be subject to prior approval of all such Participants, and accordingly such issuance may only occur at the earliest 24 hours (during business hours) after delivery of a suitable request for the Documentary Credit (as determined by the Bank) to such Participants. Equally the granting of a Cash Advance or of an Advance may be subject to approval by such Participants.
The Bank may, with the consent of the Borrower in the event an Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing, assign all or any of its rights and benefits under the Facility, or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under the Facility to any other person or insure its risks under the Facility.
The Bank may, without the consent of the Borrower in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing assign all or any of its rights and benefits under the Facility or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under the Facility to any other person or insure its risks under the Facility.
For the above purposes, the Bank (and BNP Paribas New York Branch) may fully disclose and exchange any and all information and documentation in respect of this Facility and Facility A (including but not limited to the regular Collateral Pool Reports under Facility A) with potential Participants and assignees and the Borrower releases the Bank and BNP Paribas New York Branch from all applicable banking secrecy and any other confidentiality obligations as relating to such disclosures and exchanges with prospective participants and assignees.
2. Other terms and conditions of the Agreement and Amendment no 1
Except as expressly modified by this Amendment no 2, the terms and provisions set forth in the Agreement and Amendment no 1 remain unchanged and in full force and effect..
3. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction
The Facility, the Agreement, Amendment no 1 and this Amendment no 2 are governed by and construed in accordance with Swiss law.
The exclusive jurisdiction shall be the courts of the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, provided that the Bank may at its discretion bring proceedings before any United States federal court located in the State of New York.
