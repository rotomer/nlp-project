Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Reports Third Quarter Results
SAN ANTONIO - November 2, 2011
- Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported third quarter 2011 net income of $345 million, or $2.39 per diluted share compared to net income of $56 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010.
We are pleased with the exceptional third quarter results. This marks the highest quarterly earnings since the second quarter of 2007, when the Tesoro Index was $24 per barrel (/bbl), more than $10/bbl higher than this quarter, said Greg Goff, President and CEO.
For the third quarter, the Company recorded segment operating income of $622 million, compared to segment operating income of $201 million in the third quarter of 2010, excluding one-time pre-tax expenses of $23 million associated with the Anacortes refinery outage. The year-over-year operating income improvement was driven by higher refinery utilization and capturing a significant crude cost advantage and improved margin environment.
For the third quarter, the Tesoro Index of $13.33/bbl gained more than $3/bbl from a year ago. Feedstock cost advantage, particularly in the mid-continent, drove the benchmark index higher during the quarter. West Coast benchmark diesel crack spreads were up over $1/bbl relative to last year, while gasoline crack

spreads lost more than $6/bbl. U.S. exports of distillates and continued demand growth in Asia and Latin America provided support to distillate crack spreads during the quarter. High unemployment and a year-over-year increase in retail street prices, however, tempered gasoline demand. The Company captured a gross margin of $18.43/bbl.
The Company's strong margin performance relative to the Tesoro Index was driven by capturing an advantaged crude oil cost relative to benchmark grades of crude oil and delivering reliable refining operations. On the West Coast, discounts for foreign heavy crude oil relative to domestic alternatives widened year-over-year. In the mid-continent region, crude oil priced off of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at a discount to Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS). Total throughput in the quarter was 609 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) or 92% of total crude oil capacity, the highest level in three years. The improvement from 578 mbpd or 87% of capacity in the second quarter of this year marks another sequential increase in refinery utilization rates. Sustaining higher utilization rates is a key priority for the Company.
Direct manufacturing costs in the third quarter averaged $4.57/bbl, down $0.66/bbl relative to the second quarter of 2011, excluding the benefit of $5 million in property damage insurance proceeds.
We continued to improve refinery utilization and delivered the lowest quarterly manufacturing cost per barrel in four years. We made progress on our high-return capital program and announced two additional refinery projects that leverage regional feedstock advantages and improve refinery yields. We also announced the addition of approximately 290 retail stations to our existing portfolio, strengthening our refining and marketing integration by about 12%, said Goff.

Retail fuel sales volumes were up 16% year-over-year reflecting growth in the Company's branded jobber and dealer business. Same store fuel sales during the quarter were up nearly 1% on a year-over-year basis, a significant improvement relative to the second quarter of this year. Retail operating income was $22 million, down $10 million from a year ago driven by lower fuel margins.
Corporate and unallocated costs, net of $3 million of corporate depreciation and excluding a $17 million non-cash stock-based compensation credit primarily associated with stock appreciation rights, were $39 million in the third quarter. This exceeds prior guidance due primarily to an incentive-based compensation accrual made during the quarter.
Refining and Marketing Integration
On September 8, 2011, Tesoro announced that it will add approximately 290 retail stations to its existing portfolio of nearly 1,200 stations, an increase of about 25%, through separate purchase and lease agreements with SUPERVALU, Inc. (NYSE: SVU) and Thrifty Oil Co., respectively.
 
"The combined purchase and lease of these stations increases our refining and marketing integration from about 35% to about 47%, adding profitable and secure outlets for our refined products," said Goff.
 
Tesoro has agreed to acquire from SUPERVALU, Inc. 50 Albertson's Fuel Express stations for $34 million, and plans to invest an incremental $5 million in branding capital. These stations are located in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming with total fuel sales of more than 5 mbpd. Tesoro expects to complete the transaction early in 2012.

Separately, Tesoro has agreed to lease from Thrifty Oil Co. approximately 240 retail stations located primarily in southern California for an initial term of 10 years, and expects to invest $28 million in branding capital. These stations have total fuel sales of 25 - 30 mbpd. Tesoro will take possession of the stations in a phased process, with approximately 190 stations online in 2012 and the balance of approximately 50 stations in 2014.
The majority of both the purchased and leased stations will be marketed under Tesoro's existing brands.
Capital Spending and Liquidity
Capital spending for the third quarter was $86 million and turnaround spending was $17 million. The Company currently anticipates capital spending in 2011 to be approximately $320 million. Expectations for full year 2011 turnaround spending remain at $110 million. The Company ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, up more than $500 million from the second quarter of this year, and remained undrawn with $1.0 billion of availability on the Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility. Tesoro Panama and Tesoro Logistics LP ended the quarter with $20 million and $50 million borrowed, respectively, on their separate revolving credit facilities.
Continued Debt Reduction
During the third quarter, Tesoro retired through open market purchases $84 million in senior notes and reduced total debt to total capitalization to 28%, down three percentage points from the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, the Company has reduced outstanding debt by $329 million, or 18%. The Company expects to continue to reduce total leverage, a key strategic priority, and intends to repurchase the remaining 6 % senior notes due in 2012.

Stock-Based Compensation Dilution Management Program
During the third quarter, the Company's Board of Directors approved a program designed to offset the dilutive effect of outstanding and future stock-based compensation awards. The Board authorized, and the Company subsequently executed, the purchase of 4.7 million shares of Tesoro stock to offset the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and grants. The Board also authorized a program to purchase additional shares in subsequent years to offset the dilutive effect of future stock-based compensation programs.
