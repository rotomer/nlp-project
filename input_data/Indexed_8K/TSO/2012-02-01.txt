Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Reports 2011 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
SAN ANTONIO - February 1, 2012
- Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported a fourth quarter 2011 net loss of $124 million, or $0.89 per diluted share compared to net income of $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010.
For the full year 2011, the Company reported net income of $546 million, or $3.81 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $29 million, or $0.21 per diluted share for the full year 2010.
The fourth quarter was a challenging period as a result of the dramatic change in crude oil price differentials, said Greg Goff, President and CEO of Tesoro. Despite the loss in the fourth quarter, our full year results were better than any year since 2007 when we posted similar earnings on a Tesoro Index that was 40% higher. The Company's strong performance for the year clearly demonstrates our ability to deliver fundamental improvements in the business. With a strategic focus on operational efficiency and effectiveness, the Company increased refinery utilization rates, capturing additional gross margin while reducing manufacturing costs per barrel during 2011. The resulting strong free cash flow allowed the company to reduce debt by $328 million, further strengthening its balance sheet. The Company also increased the integration between refining and marketing and successfully launched Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP).
For the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a segment operating loss of $96 million, compared to segment operating income of $85 million, excluding business interruption and property damage insurance proceeds, net of costs related to repair work at the Anacortes refinery and the write-off of goodwill at the Hawaii refinery in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in operating income is due primarily to an
1
extremely weak margin environment in California and the collapse of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to Brent crude oil spread.
The Tesoro Index was $7.50 per barrel (/bbl) for the fourth quarter, up slightly relative to a year ago. However, the Tesoro Index for the California region was a negative five cents per barrel, down more than $6/bbl relative to the fourth quarter of 2010. Unusually high prices for heavy California crude oil relative to light sweet crude oil negatively impacted the benchmark. During the quarter, heavy California crude oil traded at a narrow $1/bbl discount relative to Brent versus a wider discount of $7/bbl a year ago. Additionally, West Coast benchmark gasoline crack spreads declined nearly 50% relative to the fourth quarter of 2010. The Company captured a gross margin of $6.02/bbl.
The Company's margin underperformance relative to the Index was impacted by the collapse of the WTI to Brent crude oil spread. The discount of WTI to Brent during the fourth quarter narrowed by $18/bbl, dropping from $26/bbl at the end of September to $8/bbl at the end of December. This market price movement impacted fourth quarter results in two ways. First, by reducing benchmark margins at our refineries that run WTI-priced barrels. Second, by reducing the margin on long-haul foreign crude oil barrels indexed to WTI.
Total throughput in the quarter was 567 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) or 85% of total crude oil capacity. The decline from 609 mbpd or 92% of capacity in the third quarter of this year is due primarily to turnaround activity in the California and Pacific Northwest regions.
Direct manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter were $5.03/bbl, up $0.46/bbl from the third quarter of 2011, a result of higher maintenance spending and lower refinery throughput.
2
Retail fuel sales volumes in the fourth quarter were up 14% year-over-year reflecting growth in the Company's branded jobber and dealer business. Same store fuel sales during the quarter were essentially flat year-over-year. Retail operating income was $27 million, up $16 million from a year ago driven by higher fuel margins.
Corporate and unallocated costs, net of $2 million of corporate depreciation and excluding $21 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily associated with stock appreciation rights, were $36 million in the fourth quarter.
Capital Spending and Liquidity
Capital spending for the full year 2011 was $320 million. Turnaround spending for the full year was $109 million. Expectations for 2012 capital spending remain at $670 million, as expenditures related to the high-return capital program increase. Turnaround spending of $300 million in 2012 is projected. The Company ended the year with $900 million in cash on the balance sheet and remained undrawn on the parent company revolving credit facility with over $810 million of availability.
2012 Strategic Focus
We delivered in 2011 what we set out to deliver, said Goff. But it was the first year of a multi-year plan. As we begin 2012, our strategic priorities remain the same. Our primary focus is to reinvest free cash flow in high-return capital projects that drive significant future earnings growth. We'll also continue to drive earnings improvements that are not dependent on capital spending and we remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet with the planned retirement of the remaining $299 million of 6 1/4% senior notes due in November. Full details of the 2012 business plan can be viewed in the December Analyst Day presentation posted on the Investor Relations section of the www.tsocorp.com website.

Plan to Sell Hawaii Operations
On January 10, 2012, Tesoro Corporation announced its intention to sell its Hawaii operations, including the 94 mbpd Kapolei refinery, operations at 32 retail stations and all associated logistical assets.
Following a comprehensive analysis, we've determined that our business in Hawaii does not align with our strategic focus on the MidContinent and West Coast, said Goff. While the Hawaii business is no longer in-line with our vision for Tesoro's future, there is no question that it offers value for the right investor.
Tesoro Hawaii anticipates completing the sale no sooner than the second half of 2012, subject to regulatory and other approvals.
Refining and Marketing Integration
Tesoro recently closed on the purchase of 49 Albertson's Fuel Express retail stations from SUPERVALU, Inc. (NYSE: SVU). These stations are located in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming with total fuel sales of about 5 mbpd.
