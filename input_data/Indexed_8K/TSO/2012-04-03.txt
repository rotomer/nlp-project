Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2.):
Effective April 1, 2012, Tesoro Corporation ("Tesoro") entered into a transaction (the "Contribution") among Tesoro Logistics LP (the "Partnership" or "TLLP"), Tesoro Logistics GP LLC (the "General Partner"), Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company ("TRMC") and Tesoro Logistics Operations, LLC (the "Operating Company") to contribute from TRMC through the General Partner and the Partnership to the Operating Company the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal and associated pipelines (the "Terminal") in Martinez, California. The Contribution was made in exchange for consideration from the Partnership to the General Partner of $75.0 million, comprised of $67.5 million in cash financed with borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility and the issuance of equity with a combined fair value of $7.5 million. The equity is comprised of 4,212 general partner units to maintain the General Partner's 2% general partner interest in the Partnership and 206,362 common units representing an approximate 1% limited partner interest in the Partnership.
The Terminal contributed is near Tesoro's Martinez, California refinery (the "Refinery") and is located on the Carquinez Straight of San Francisco Bay near the Sacramento River. The Terminal consists of a single-berth dock (the "Wharf Assets and Related Leasehold Improvements"), five crude oil storage tanks with a combined capacity of 425,000 shell barrels and related pipelines that receive crude oil from third-party vessels for delivery to the Refinery and a third-party terminal. Total throughput capacity for the terminal is estimated to be approximately 145,000 barrels per day ("bpd").
Waterborne crude oil can be received at the proprietary wharf for delivery to the Refinery. The Terminal can receive ships of up to 188,500 dead weight tons.
There are five hydrocarbon tanks, with a total shell capacity in excess of 425,000 barrels, and two firewater tanks, with 48,000 barrels of total shell capacity. The tanks have an average age of 72 years with an average estimated 13 years until the next scheduled maintenance turnaround and internal inspection. The facility was recommissioned in 2001. The estimated remaining useful life of all assets contributed ranges from five to 27 years.
The pipelines associated with the Terminal include three crude oil pipelines, one products pipeline and one water pipeline that connect the Terminal to the Refinery and an adjacent third-party terminal.
The Wharf Assets and Related Leasehold Improvements are situated on an offshore parcel of land that is currently being leased by Tesoro from the California State Lands Commission under a term lease (the "Wharf Lease"). The Wharf Lease and the Related Leasehold Improvements and the pipelines will not be transferred to the Partnership until the Wharf Lease is renewed and extended and the transfer is approved by the California State Lands Commission. Fee title to the 70 acre onshore parcel where the tanks are located was conveyed to the Operating Company effective April 1, 2012. The Partnership will manage the operation of all of the assets and receive fees for services commencing April 1, 2012.
 
The Partnership will reimburse Tesoro and its subsidiaries for the provision of field-level employees supporting the Terminal under the terms of the Amended and Restated Operational Services Agreement.
On April 2, 2012, Tesoro issued a press release announcing the contribution of the Terminal to the Partnership which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
In connection with the Contribution, Tesoro entered into the following material definitive agreements:
Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement
The description of the Contribution Agreement (as defined below) provided below under Item 2.01 is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference. A copy of the Contribution Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement
Effective April 1, 2012, in connection with the Contribution, Tesoro entered into an Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (the "Amended Omnibus Agreement") among the Partnership, the General Partner, TRMC, Tesoro Alaska Company ("Tesoro Alaska") and Tesoro Companies, Inc. ("TCI") that amends and restates the original agreement those parties entered into at the time of the Partnership's initial public offering. The Amended Omnibus Agreement added the following matters to the original agreement:
So long as Tesoro controls the General Partner, the Amended Omnibus Agreement will remain in full force and effect unless mutually terminated by the parties. If Tesoro ceases to control the General Partner, either party may terminate the Amended Omnibus Agreement, provided that the indemnification obligations of the parties made under the Omnibus Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Omnibus Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Amorco Marine Terminal Use and Throughput Agreement
Effective April 1, 2012, in connection with the Contribution, TRMC entered into a 10-year use and throughput agreement (the "Amorco Marine Terminal Use and Throughput Agreement") with the Operating Company under which the pipelines and tanks at the Terminal will be dedicated and used exclusively for the throughput and storage of TRMC's crude oil and refined products. Under the agreement, TRMC is obligated to transport an average of at least 65,000 bpd of crude oil per month at a throughput and tankage fee of $0.55 per barrel. An excess volume throughput fee of $0.10 per barrel will be charged for volumes in excess of 70,000 bpd. In addition, TRMC will pay a $30,000 per month fee for unlimited use of the refined products pipeline at the Terminal. The fees under the agreement are indexed for inflation and the agreement gives TRMC the option to renew for two five-year terms.
If TRMC fails to transport aggregate volumes equal to its minimum throughput commitment during any calendar month, TRMC will owe the Operating Company a shortfall payment equal to the volume of the shortfall multiplied by the throughput and tankage fee. The amount of any shortfall payment paid by TRMC will be credited against any amounts owed by TRMC for the transportation of volumes in excess of its minimum throughput commitment during any of the succeeding three months.
Prior to the assignment of the Wharf Lease and Related Leasehold Improvements to the Operating Company, the Operating Company will manage operation of these assets and reimburse TRMC for its ongoing lease expenses.
The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amorco Marine Terminal Use and Throughput Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Relationships
Each of the Partnership, the General Partner, TRMC, Tesoro Alaska, TCI and the Operating Company is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Tesoro. As a result, certain individuals, including officers and directors of Tesoro and the General Partner, serve as officers and/or directors of more than one of such other entities. After the Contribution, the General Partner, as the general partner of the Partnership, holds 626,861 general partner units of the Partnership, which represents a 2% general partner interest, and 206,362 common units of the Partnership, which represents an approximate 1% limited partner interest in the Partnership. Tesoro, together with TRMC, Tesoro Alaska and the General Partner, holds 511,252 common units and 15,254,890 subordinated units of the Partnership, which represent a 50% limited partner interest, in addition to the 2% general partner interest in the Partnership discussed above.
In addition, some of the lenders under our Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below) and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Tesoro and its subsidiaries or the Partnership or its subsidiaries.
Amendment No. 1 and Joinder to Credit Agreement
 
In addition to the agreements entered into in connection with the Contribution, the Partnership entered into the following material agreement:
 
On March 30, 2012, the Partnership entered into an Amendment No. 1 and Joinder (the "First Amendment") to its senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated April 26, 2011, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of banks and financial institutions as lenders. Concurrently with the execution of the First Amendment, and pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Partnership exercised its option to increase the size of the loan commitments under the Credit Agreement to an aggregate of $300 million.
The First Amendment provides for certain amendments to the Credit Agreement relating to the Contribution, modified certain definitions and permits the Partnership to request that the loan commitments under the Credit Agreement be increased up to an aggregate of $450 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders. The Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, is guaranteed by all of the Partnership's subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, is scheduled to mature on April 25, 2014.
 
The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full First Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

The Operating Company has the option to rescind the Contribution if the California State Lands Commission has issued a final determination, after the exhaustion of all possible administrative appeals within the applicable agency, (i) to refuse to extend and renew the Wharf Lease to allow the Operating Company to operate the Wharf for the initial 10-year term of the Amorco Marine Terminal Use and Throughput Agreement, (ii) to refuse to approve the assignment of the Wharf Lease to the Operating Company at the time of the extension of the Wharf Lease (or earlier if the Operating Company requests an assignment pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, or (iii) to impose conditions upon an extension and renewal or an assignment of the Wharf Lease that are unacceptable to the Operating Company and not consistent with the current terms thereof (other than increased rent, in accordance with current standards). If rescinded, the consideration previously paid will be reimbursed, the assets shall be assigned back to TRMC and the agreements entered into with respect to the Contribution shall be terminated.
In addition, at least 30 days prior to any expiration or termination of the Amorco Marine Terminal Use and Throughput Agreement (except for a termination based on cessation of Refinery operations (as defined in the Amorco Marine Terminal Use and Throughput Agreement)), TRMC may deliver written notice to the Operating Company of its intent to repurchase all of the contributed assets. Such purchase shall be at the fair market value of such assets.

As soon as practicable, but in any event within 60 days after receipt of the Offer, the General Partner shall notify the Tesoro Entity in writing that either (i) the General Partner has elected not to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, in which event the Tesoro Entity shall be forever free to continue to own or operate such Subject Assets, or (ii) the General Partner has elected to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, in which event the procedures outlined in the remainder of this
Section 2.3

If the Parties agree that the Administrative Fee for that year should be reduced, then Tesoro shall promptly pay to the Partnership the amount of any reduction for that year.

2. Anchorage #2 Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. The site is considered characterized and is currently undergoing groundwater monitoring and treatment. Off-site groundwater investigations are scheduled for 2012.
3. Stockton Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline and diesel releases from pipelines and/or product storage tanks. The site is considered substantially characterized and is undergoing groundwater treatment and groundwater monitoring. Off-site groundwater impacts are commingled with neighboring petroleum storage terminals.
4. Burley Terminal groundwater was impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. Groundwater impacts were commingled with neighboring petroleum storage terminals. Hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater samples do not exceed previously established target levels for groundwater and surface water protection. Regulatory closure is pending.
5. Wilmington Sales Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. Groundwater investigation and monitoring is on-going. Tesoro is indemnified by the previous owner for Investigation and remediation obligations.
6. Salt Lake City Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline and diesel releases from pipelines and/or product storage tanks occurring prior to Tesoro's purchase of the facility. The site is considered characterized and is currently undergoing removal of product from the water table and long-term monitoring.

7. The Stockton Terminal emits volatile organic compounds (VOCs) below major source emission criteria. In 2010, the San Joaquin Air Quality Management District announced it is reducing its major source threshold. When the Stockton Terminal expands its operations or increases throughput, the potential to emit VOC will increase and the Stockton terminal will become subject to regulation as a major source. This will require a Title V Air Operating Permit. In addition, the Stockton facility will be required to install an automated continuous emission monitor at a cost of approximately $75,000.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the effective Operating Capacity of the Amorco Assets, each Month during the Term, TRMC shall be entitled to receive the Minimum Throughput Commitment at the Wharf. The Pipelines identified on
Schedule A
attached hereto and the Tanks identified on
Schedule B
attached hereto shall be dedicated and used exclusively for the throughput and storage of TRMC's Products. For those dedicated Pipelines and Tanks, TRMC shall be responsible for providing all line fill and tank heels required for the operation of such Pipelines and Tanks. At any time after any such Product has been received in such Tanks, TLO may, for operational, environmental or safety reasons, move such Product to one or more other Tanks within the Storage Facility, at TLO's sole cost and expense.
The Parties anticipate that the 
Commencement Date
 will be April 1, 2012. The actual Commencement Date shall be the date specified by TLO in a written notice to TRMC. The Parties agree that there are a number of factors that may affect the actual Commencement Date. Consequently, neither Party shall have any right or remedy against the other Party if the actual Commencement Date is earlier or later than the anticipated Commencement Date.
The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall continue through March 31, 2022 (the 
Initial Term
);
provided
,
however
, that TRMC may, at its option, extend the Initial Term for up to two (2) renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, an 
Extension Period
) by providing written notice of its intent to TLO no less than ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then-current Extension Period. The Initial Term, and any extensions of this Agreement as provided above, shall be referred to herein as the 
Term
.
(a)    
Throughput and Tankage Fees
. TRMC agrees to pay to TLO the following fees for all Barrels of crude oil throughput by TRMC at the Wharf and on the Crude Oil Pipelines, and stored at the Storage Facility (collectively, the 
Throughput and Tankage Fees
):
(i)    a Minimum Throughput Commitment Fee (the 
MTCF
) of $1,087,395.65 per Month which is $0.55/Barrel multiplied by the Minimum Throughput Commitment;
plus
(ii)    $0.55/Barrel for all vessel receipts throughput in a Month in excess of the Minimum Throughput Commitment but less than 2,129,167 Barrels (the 
Incremental Volume Throughput Fee
);
plus
(iii)     $0.10/Barrel for all vessel receipts throughput in a Month in excess of 2,129,167 Barrels (the 
Excess Volume Throughput Fee
), such excess encompassing the aggregate use of the Wharf, Tanks and Crude Oil Pipelines, and such fee to be the exclusive throughput fee for
6
\36164683.6
volumes in excess of 2,129,167 Barrels in a Month;
provided
,
however
, that any applicable costs specified in Section 6 below shall still apply to any such excess volumes.
(b)    
Unlimited Refined Products Pipeline Use Fee
. TRMC agrees to pay to TLO a $30,000/Month flat fee for TRMC's unlimited use of the Refined Products Pipeline (the 
URPP Use Fee
), subject to the physical capacity thereof.
(c)    
Fee Adjustments
.
(i)    All fees set forth in Section 5(a) and (b) above shall be increased on July 1 of each year of the Term,
by a percentage equal to the greater of zero or the positive change in the CPI-U (All Urban Consumers), as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
(ii)    TLO has the right to adjust the MTCF to include the actual increase of any CSLC lease rental expense under the Lease Renewal.
(a)
Surcharges and Reimbursements
. TRMC shall reimburse TLO for, or TLO shall be permitted to charge TRMC an additional per Barrel surcharge for any and all of the following:
(i)
the actual cost of any capital expenditures that TLO agrees to make upon TRMC's request, including those provided for in Section 6(c) through (e) below;
(ii)
any cleaning, degassing or other preparation of the Tanks at the expiration of this Agreement or as specifically requested by TRMC;
(iii)
The costs that TLO incurs in complying with any new Applicable Laws that affect the Storage Facility, the Pipelines or services provided by TLO to TRMC hereunder;
provided
, that (A) compliance by TLO with any such new law or regulation requires substantial unanticipated capital expenditures by TLO, (B) TLO has made good faith efforts to mitigate the effect of any such law or regulation and (C) TLO has negotiated in good faith with TRMC in order to agree on the level of any such surcharge;
(iv)
Any capital expenditures or other costs incurred by TLO for currently unanticipated improvements to the Wharf that may be required by the CSLC in connection with the Lease Renewal;
provided
, that (A) TLO has made good faith efforts to mitigate those costs and (B) TLO has negotiated in good faith with TRMC in order to agree on the level of any surcharge;
(v)
All taxes (other than ad valorem taxes, property taxes, income taxes, gross receipt taxes, payroll taxes and similar taxes) that TLO specifically incurs on TRMC's behalf for the services TLO provides to TRMC hereunder, if such reimbursement is not prohibited by law;
(vi)
Any costs for Wharf dredging beyond routine maintenance dredging that materially increases operating costs above historical levels;
(vii)
Any future assessments made by the Army Corp of Engineers or other agencies for dredging or deepening of the channels leading to the Wharf;
provided
,
7
\36164683.6
however
, that TRMC will have approval authority for discretionary Army Corp of Engineers expenditures that may require a surcharge to be imposed; and
(viii)
If TRMC objects to TLO incurring any costs under items (iv), (vi) or (vii) above, or to the level of any surcharge under (iii) above, then TLO shall incur and impose a surcharge for those expenditures as it deems, in its sole discretion, to be mandatory. In such case, if TLO determines that all or some costs to which TRMC has objected could be reduced or mitigated by changes in operation of any of the Amorco Assets, including taking an Amorco Asset out of service, reducing capacity of an Amorco Asset, or restricting use of an Amorco Asset, then TRMC may request that TLO do so, rather than imposing a surcharge to maintain service at a particular level, and in that event, TLO shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate such request;
provided
that TLO shall not be required to take any actions that it believes in good faith might result in a violation of any Operating Requirement and such reduction in capacity shall not be a Force Majeure event or other basis for any reduction in TRMC's Minimum Throughput Commitment or for a reduction in any fees except surcharges avoided by such reduction in capacity.
(b)
Lease Renewal Costs
. TLO shall be permitted to charge TRMC an additional per Barrel surcharge for an amount sufficient to compensate TLO for an increase in operating costs resulting from the actual increase of any CSLC lease rental expense under the Lease Renewal;
(c)
Service Interruptions
. TLO shall use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the interruption of service at the Wharf, the Storage Facility and each Pipeline. TLO shall promptly inform TRMC's operational personnel of any anticipated partial or complete interruption of service at the Wharf, any Pipeline or Tank, including relevant information about the nature, extent, cause and expected duration of the interruption and the actions TLO is taking to resume full operations,
provided
that TLO shall not have any liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, TRMC of any such matters except to the extent TRMC has been materially prejudiced or damaged by such failure or delay. To the extent practicable, TLO shall coordinate repairs and maintenance on the Amorco Assets with TRMC's planned shipping schedule to minimize downtime when TRMC has scheduled use of the Amorco Assets. Notwithstanding any of the immediately foregoing to the contrary, if TRMC is unable to throughput 65,000 Barrels on any day when TRMC has scheduled the berthing of a vessel at the Wharf, by reason of any of the Amorco Assets being out of service, the Minimum Throughput Commitment shall be reduced by 65,000 Barrels per day for each full day that the Wharf remains out of service to allow berthing and unloading by such vessel and delivery of the cargo at the Refinery.
(d)
Maintenance and Repair Standards
. Subject to Force Majeure and interruptions for routine repair and maintenance, consistent with customary terminal industry standards, TLO shall maintain the Wharf and each Pipeline and Tank in a condition and with a capacity sufficient to throughput a volume of TRMC's Products at least equal to the current Operating Capacity for such Pipeline and Tanks and the Wharf and Storage Facility as a whole. TLO's obligations may be temporarily suspended during the occurrence of, and for the entire duration of, a Force Majeure or other interruption of service, to the extent such Force Majeure or other interruption of service impairs TLO's ability to perform such obligations. If for any reason, including, without limitation, a Force Majeure event, the throughput or storage capacity of the Wharf, any Pipeline or Tank should fall below its current Operating Capacity, then within a reasonable period of time thereafter, TLO shall make commercially reasonable repairs to restore the capacity of the Wharf, such Pipeline or Tank to current Operating Capacity (
Restoration
). Except as provided below in Section 6(e), all of such Restoration shall be at TLO's cost and expense unless the damage creating the need for such repairs was caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of TRMC, its employees, agents or customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TLO shall have only one Tank and
8
\36164683.6
transfer pump at a time out for scheduled maintenance. TLO will make best commercial efforts to coordinate major scheduled maintenance projects or other planned Dock outages with the Refinery's #50 Crude Unit turnaround schedule.
(e)
Capacity Resolution
.    In the event of the failure of TLO to maintain the Wharf, any Pipeline or Tank in a condition and with a capacity sufficient to throughput and store a volume of TRMC's Products equal to its current Operating Capacity, then either Party shall have the right to call a meeting between executives of both Parties by providing at least two (2) Business Days' advance written notice. Any such meeting shall be held at a mutually agreeable location and will be attended by executives of both Parties each having sufficient authority to commit his or her respective Party to a Capacity Resolution (as defined below). At the meeting, the Parties will negotiate in good faith with the objective of reaching a joint resolution for the Restoration of capacity on the Wharf, Pipeline or Tank which will, among other things, specify steps to be taken by TLO to fully accomplish Restoration and the deadlines by which the Restoration must be completed (the 
Capacity Resolution
). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Capacity Resolution shall set forth an agreed upon time schedule for the Restoration activities. Such time schedule shall be reasonable under the circumstances, consistent with customary terminal industry standards and shall take into consideration TLO's economic considerations relating to costs of the repairs and TRMC's requirements concerning its refining and marketing operations. TLO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide storage and throughput of TRMC's Products at the Wharf, Pipelines and Storage Facility, to the extent the Wharf, Pipelines and Storage Facility have capability of doing so, during the period before Restoration is completed;
provided
,
however
, that the Throughput and Tankage Fee shall be reduced to account for the reduced Operating Capacity until such Restoration is complete. In the event that TRMC's economic considerations justify incurring additional costs to restore the Wharf, Pipeline or Tank in a more expedited manner than the time schedule determined in accordance with the preceding sentences, TRMC may require TLO to expedite the Restoration to the extent reasonably possible, subject to TRMC's payment, in advance, of the estimated incremental costs to be incurred as a result of the expedited time schedule. In the event that the Operating Capacity of a Tank is reduced, and the Parties agree that the Restoration of such Tank to its full Operating Capacity is not justified under the standards set forth in the preceding sentences, then the Parties shall negotiate an appropriate adjustment to the Throughput and Tankage Fees to account for the reduced Operating Capacity available for TRMC's use. In the event the Parties agree to an expedited Restoration plan in which TRMC agrees to fund a portion of the Restoration cost or a reduced Throughput and Tankage Fee, then neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 20 below as a result of the events necessitating the Restoration contemplated by this Section 6(e), so long as any such Restoration is completed with due diligence. TRMC shall pay its portion of the Restoration costs to TLO in advance based on an estimate
based on reasonable engineering standards promulgated by the Association for Facilities Engineering
.
Upon completion, TRMC shall pay the difference between the actual portion of Restoration costs to be paid by TRMC pursuant to this Section 6(e) and the estimated amount paid under the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after receipt of TLO's invoice therefor, or, if appropriate, TLO shall pay TRMC the excess of the estimate paid by TRMC over TLO's actual costs as previously described within thirty (30) days after completion of the Restoration.
(f)
TRMC's Right To Cure
. If at any time after the occurrence of (x) a Partnership Change of Control or (y) a sale of the Refinery, TLO either (i) refuses or fails to meet with TRMC within the period set forth in Section 6(e), (ii) fails to agree to perform a Capacity Resolution in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 6(e), or (iii) fails to perform its obligations in compliance with the terms of a Capacity Resolution, TRMC may, as its sole remedy for any breach by TLO of any of its obligations under Section 6(e), require TLO to complete a Restoration of the affected Amorco Asset, and the Throughput and Tankage Fee shall be reduced to account for the reduced Operating Capacity until such Restoration is completed. Any such Restoration required under this Section 6(f) shall be completed by TLO at TRMC's cost. TLO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide storage and
9
\36164683.6
throughput of TRMC's Products at the affected Amorco Asset while such Restoration is being completed. Any work performed by TLO pursuant to this Section 6(f) shall be performed and completed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable pipeline industry standards and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and/or regulations. Additionally, during such period after the occurrence of (x) a Partnership Change of Control or (y) a sale of the Refinery, TRMC may exercise any remedies available to it under this Agreement (other than termination), including the right to immediately seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief for specific performance by TLO of the applicable provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to make Restorations as described herein.
7.
OPERATION OF THE WHARF AND PIPELINES DURING INTERIM PERIOD
(a)    
TLO Covenants
. During the Interim Period, TLO covenants as follows:
(i)    the General Partner, on behalf of TLO, will provide necessary personnel, equipment and other services for the operation and maintenance of the Wharf and the Pipelines.
(ii)    TLO will reimburse TRMC for:
(1) all rentals under the Wharf Lease;
 
(2) any and all repairs and maintenance costs and capital expenditures for the Wharf and Pipelines, including without limitation all state required Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance Standards (
MOTEMS
) obligations (other than those originally scheduled prior to the Commencement Date), but excluding those Amorco related-items specified in Schedule VI of the Omnibus Agreement, and any and all repairs and maintenance costs and capital expenditures resulting from a defect in existence at the time of the conveyance of the Wharf and Pipelines to TLO to the extent to which TRMC shall indemnify TLO pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement;
(3) all right of way expenses for the Pipelines; and
(4) without duplication of any amounts reimbursed or paid under the Omnibus Agreement or the Operational Services Agreement, any and all taxes, fees, insurance premiums, assessments or spill planning and/or response costs (except those costs for oil spill response services provided by the Marine Preservation Association related to obligations for oil spill prevention response, as provided in Schedule IV of the Omnibus Agreement) incurred by TRMC as lessee under the Wharf Lease or owner of the Pipelines.
(iii)    To the extent that any costs for which TLO should reimburse TRMC would be costs that could be immediately recovered by TLO by reason of per barrel surcharge to TRMC, as otherwise provided in Section 6, then TLO shall not be required to reimburse TRMC, and the surcharges shall not apply to such costs.
(iv)    TLO will also indemnify TRMC against any other claims, liabilities or losses that TRMC incurs in its status as lessee under the Wharf Lease or owner of the Pipelines during the Interim Period.
(b)    
TRMC Covenants
. During the Interim Period, TRMC covenants as follows:
(i)    TRMC shall pay to TLO those fees specified in Section 5 above.
10
\36164683.6
(ii)    If the Lease Renewal requires a retroactive payment for increased rentals under the Wharf Lease prior to the date the Lease Renewal is issued by the CSLC, then TRMC shall remain solely responsible for paying such increased rentals for the prior period. TLO shall not be required to reimburse TRMC for any such retroactive increase attributable to the Interim Period, nor shall the MTCF be increased to cover such retroactive increased rentals attributable to the Interim Period.
(
iii)    It is anticipated that TRMC may seek to obtain from the CSLC a renewal and extension of its nearby Avon wharf at the same time that it obtains a renewal and assignment of the Wharf Lease for the Amorco Wharf. TRMC will remain solely responsible for all costs associated with renewal and extension of the lease for the Avon wharf.
(c)    
Mutual Covenants
. During the Interim Period, both TRMC and TLO covenant as follows:
(i)    To cooperate in good faith to complete the Lease Assignment and the Lease Renewal and to complete the COFR Assignment. The Parties will cooperate and proceed in good faith to expedite issuance by the CSLC of the Lease Renewal and Lease Assignment as soon as reasonably practicable, under terms and procedures consistent with CSLC and state requirements.
    
(
ii)    At any time before the issuance of the Lease Renewal, TLO will have the right to request that TRMC assign to TLO the current holdover Wharf Lease, and upon such request, TRMC will act with reasonable diligence, and TLO will cooperate with TRMC, in order to obtain CSLC approval of the transfer of the Wharf Lease as soon as reasonably practicable, under terms and procedures consistent with CSLC and state requirements. Ownership of the Pipelines will be transferred concurrently with such assignment of the Wharf Lease and the Parties will cooperate in good faith to consummate such conveyance.
(a)    
Monthly Shortfall Credit
. If, during any Month, actual Barrels throughput by TRMC are less than the Minimum Throughput Commitment, then TRMC shall nevertheless pay to TLO the MTCF. TRMC shall be entitled to a credit (a 
Shortfall Credit
) equal to the product of $.55/Barrel multiplied by the difference between the Minimum Throughput Commitment and the volumes actually received at the Wharf during such Month. The Shortfall Credit shall be posted as a credit to TRMC's account, and shall be applied in subsequent Monthly invoices against amounts owed by TRMC for Incremental Volume Throughput Fees and Excess Volume Throughput Fees during any of the succeeding three (3) Months. A Shortfall Credit will be applied in the order in which such Shortfall Credit accrues and any portion of the Shortfall Credit that is not used by TRMC during the succeeding three (3) Months will expire (e.g., a Shortfall Credit which accrues in January will be available in February, March and April, will expire at the end of April, and must be applied prior to applying such Shortfall Credit which accrues in February).
(b)    
Monthly Reconciliation
. Actual volumes are to be determined Monthly, based upon vessel receipts during that Month and credited towards the Minimum Throughput Commitment in such Month. Deliveries of a vessel's cargo will apply to the Month in which unloading is completed;
provided
,
however
, that if a cargo cannot be unloaded in the Month in which unloading was scheduled due to the failure of TLO to perform the unloading as scheduled, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate Month in which to credit receipt of such cargo. At the end of each Month, TLO
11
\36164683.6
will calculate the total fees that TRMC incurred for throughputting Barrels during such Month, as follows:
TLO will also calculate the amount of any special reimbursements required under Section 6(a), setting forth reasonable detail of the basis for such reimbursement.
TRMC will calculate all costs incurred by TRMC as lessee under the Wharf Lease and owner of the Pipelines during the Interim Period for reimbursement by TLO, as required under Section 7.
(c)    
Invoices
. Each Party will invoice the other Party Monthly, providing its calculations of all the applicable items set forth above, and all amounts owed shall be due and payable no later than ten (10) Business Days after such Party's receipt of the other Party's invoice. The MTCF shall be invoiced at the end of the Month for which it applies. Netting shall be permitted for amounts owed by TRMC to TLO against amounts owed by TLO to TRMC for costs incurred by TRMC as lessee under the Wharf Lease and owner of the Pipelines. Any past due payments owed by either Party to the other shall accrue interest, payable on demand, at the lesser of (i) the rate of interest announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase Bank, in New York, New York, as JPMorgan Chase Bank's prime rate (which Parties acknowledge and agree is announced by such bank and used by the Parties for reference purposes only and may not represent the lowest or best rate available to any of the customers of such bank or the Parties),
plus
four percent (4%), and (ii) the highest rate of interest (if any) permitted by Applicable Law, from the due date of the payment through the actual date of payment.
All vetting of vessels and scheduling of receipts into the Wharf and delivery into and redelivery out of the Tanks into the Pipelines shall be made in accordance with those procedures and general terms and conditions substantially set forth in the form attached hereto as
Schedule C
. TRMC shall identify to TLO prior to the delivery of any Product to the Wharf the specific Pipelines and Tanks to be used for receiving, transporting and storing such Product. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, TLO shall in no way be responsible for demurrage.
(a)    
Services
. The services provided by TLO pursuant to this Agreement shall consist of throughputting, handling and storage of the Products at the Wharf, the Storage Facility and the Pipelines.
12
\36164683.6
(b)    
Operations
. TLO will operate the Wharf, Storage Facility and the Pipelines consistent with customary industry practices, as applicable for a single user operation. The Wharf, Storage Facility and Pipelines will be available on 24/7/365 basis, as needed.
(c)    
Volume Gains and Losses
. TLO shall have no obligation to measure volume gains and losses and shall have no liability whatsoever for normal course physical losses that may result from the storage of the Products at the Tanks and the transportation of the Products through the Wharf and Pipelines, except if such losses are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of TLO, as further described in Section 19 herein. TRMC will bear any volume gains and losses that may result from the storage or transportation of the Products at the Wharf, Storage Facility and through the Pipelines, respectively.
In order to effectuate the underlying objectives of this Agreement, TLO agrees that during the Term, the Amorco Assets shall be dedicated exclusively to the use of TRMC, and TLO shall not use any Amorco Asset to provide services for any third party, except upon specific directions from TRMC. The Pipelines identified on
Schedule A
attached hereto and the Tanks identified on
Schedule B
attached hereto shall be dedicated and used exclusively for the throughput and storage of TRMC's Products. At any time after any such Product has been received in such Tanks, TLO may, for operational, environmental or safety reasons, and in its sole discretion, move such Product to one or more other Tanks within the Storage Facility, at TLO's sole cost and expense.
TLO shall be deemed to have custody of the Product being transported through the Wharf, in the Storage Facility and on the Pipelines to the Storage Facility at the time it enters the Wharf; for other Products, TLO shall be deemed to have custody where it enters the receiving line at the Storage Facility. TRMC shall be deemed to receive custody of the Product at the time it enters the Refinery from the Pipelines. Upon re-delivery of any Product to TRMC's account, TRMC shall become solely responsible for any loss, damage or injury to Person or property or the environment, arising out of transportation, possession or use of such Product
after transfer of custody
. Title and risk of loss to all TRMC's Products received at the Wharf, in the Storage Facility, the Tanks, and the Pipelines shall remain with TRMC at all times. Both Parties acknowledge that this Agreement represents a bailment of Products by TRMC to TLO and not a consignment of Products, it being understood that TLO has no authority hereunder to sell or seek purchasers for the Products of TRMC. TRMC hereby warrants that it shall have good title to and the right to deliver, store and receive Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. TRMC acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and except with respect to the Wharf and the Pipelines during the Interim Period, TRMC has or acquires no right, title or interest in or to any of Wharf, the Storage Facility (including the Tanks) and the Pipelines, except the right to receive, deliver, load, unload and store the Products in the Tanks and through the Pipelines as set forth herein. TLO shall retain control of the Storage Facility, including the Tanks, and after Lease Assignment, the Wharf and the Pipelines, at all times.
Each of the Parties hereby agrees to strictly abide by the Operating Requirements. Each Party, to the extent applicable, shall also carry out the handling of the Products at the Wharf, Storage Facility, the Tanks, and the Pipelines in accordance with the Operating Requirements.
13
\36164683.6
(a)
Tank Modifications
. Each of Tanks shall be used for its historical service,
provided
however
, that TRMC may request that a Tank be changed for storage of a different grade or type of Product. In such an instance, TLO shall agree in good faith to a change in such service, if the same can be accomplished in accordance with reasonable commercial standards, accepted industry and engineering guidelines, permit requirements and Applicable Law. If any such modifications, improvements, vapor recovery, cleaning, degassing, or other preparation of the Tanks is performed by TLO at the request of TRMC, TRMC shall bear all direct costs attributable thereto, including, without limitation, the cost of removal, processing, transportation, and disposal of all waste and the cost of any taxes or charges TLO may be required to pay in regard to such waste. TLO may require TRMC to pay all such amounts prior to commencement of any remodeling work on the Tanks, or by mutual agreement, the Parties may agree upon an increase in the Throughput and Tankage Fees reimburse TLO for its costs of such modifications, plus a reasonable return on capital.
(b)
Responsibility for Fees
. Should TLO take any of Tanks out of service for regulatory requirements, repair, or maintenance, TRMC shall be solely responsible for any alternative storage or product movements as required and all fees associated with such movements. TRMC shall not be reimbursed for any outside storage or transportation costs associated with any alternative movements that result from foregoing requirements. TRMC shall not be responsible to TLO for any throughput fees and dedicated tank storage fees associated with any Tanks taken out of service during the period that such Tank is out of service.
15.
LIEN WAIVERS
TLO hereby waives, relinquishes and releases any and all liens, including without limitation, any and all warehouseman's liens, custodian's liens, rights of retention and/or similar rights under all applicable laws, which TLO would or might otherwise have under or with respect to all Products stored or handled hereunder. TLO further agrees to furnish documents reasonably acceptable to TRMC and its lender(s) (if applicable), and to cooperate with TRMC in assuring and demonstrating that Product titled in TRMC's name shall not be subject to any lien on the Storage Facility or TLO's crude oil and other products stored there.
TRMC shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes, levies, royalties, assessments, licenses, fees, charges, surcharges and sums due of any nature whatsoever (other than ad valorem taxes, property taxes, income taxes, gross receipt taxes, payroll taxes and similar taxes) imposed by any federal, state or local government that TLO incurs on TRMC's behalf for the services provided by TLO under this Agreement. If TLO is required to pay any of the foregoing, TRMC shall promptly reimburse TLO in accordance with the payment terms set forth in this Agreement.
(a)

Applicable Law
. The Parties are entering into this Agreement in reliance upon and shall fully comply with all Applicable Law which directly or indirectly affects the Products throughput hereunder, or any receipt, throughput delivery, transportation, handling or storage of Products hereunder or the ownership, operation or condition of the Amorco Assets. Each Party shall be responsible for compliance with all Applicable Laws associated with such Party's respective performance hereunder and the operation of such Party's facilities. To the extent required by Applicable Law, and as applicable to the services performed under this Agreement, each Party shall specifically comply, and require its contractors and subcontractor(s) to comply with California Civil Code, Section 1714.43, as applicable to ensure that all contractors, subcontractors, vendors and suppliers comply with all labor laws, including laws against slave labor and human trafficking and that such contractors, subcontractors, vendors and suppliers verify that the materials incorporated into any products manufactured for either Party are in compliance with all such laws.

(d)    
New Or Changed Applicable Law
. If during the Term, any new Applicable Law becomes effective or any existing Applicable Law or its interpretation is materially changed, which change is not addressed by another provision of this Agreement and which has a material adverse economic impact upon a Party, then either Party, acting in good faith, shall have the option to request renegotiation of the relevant provisions of this Agreement with respect to future performance. The Parties shall then meet and negotiate in good faith amendments to this Agreement that will conform this Agreement to the new Applicable Law while preserving the Parties' economic, operational, commercial and competitive arrangements in accordance with the understandings set forth herein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except to the extent set forth herein, neither Party shall be liable or responsible to the other Party or such other Party's affiliated Persons for any consequential, incidental, or punitive damages (including demurrage, whether related to marine movements or otherwise), or for loss of profits or revenues (collectively referred to as special damages) incurred by such Party or its affiliated Persons that arise out of or relate to this Agreement, regardless of whether any such claim arises under or results from contract, tort, or strict liability;
provided
that the foregoing limitation is not intended and shall not affect special damages imposed in favor of unaffiliated Persons that are not Parties to this Agreement. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither Party makes any guarantees or warranties of any kind, expressed or implied, and each Party specifically disclaims all implied warranties of any kind or nature, including any implied warranty of merchantability and/or any implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, TLO shall release, defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless TRMC and each of its respective affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees, successors-in-interest and assignees (each individually, a 
TRMC Indemnitee

TRMC Indemnitees

PROVIDED
THAT
TLO SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY OR HOLD HARMLESS ANY TRMC INDEMNITEE FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT THEY RESULT FROM THE BREACH OF CONTRACT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH TRMC INDEMNITEE.
(b)    Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, TRMC shall release, defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless TLO and each of its respective affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees, successors-in-interest and assignees (each individually, a 
TLO Indemnitee
, and collectively, the 
TLO Indemnitees
) from and against any and all demands, claims (including third-party claims), losses, costs, suits, or causes of action (including, but not limited to, any judgments, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, expenses, interest, reasonable legal fees, costs of suit, and damages, whether in law or equity and whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) for or relating to (i) personal or bodily injury to, or death of the employees of any TLO Indemnitee and, as applicable, its carriers, customers, representatives, and agents; (ii) loss of or damage to any property, products, material, and/or equipment belonging to any TLO Indemnitee and, as applicable, its carriers, customers, representatives, and agents, and each of their respective affiliates, contractors, and subcontractors (except for those volume losses provided for herein); (iii) loss of or damage to any other property, products, material, and/or equipment of any other description (except for those volume losses provided for herein), and/or personal or bodily injury to, or death of any other Person or Persons; and with respect to clauses (i) through (iii) above, to the extent caused by or resulting from the wrongful acts and omissions of TRMC, in connection with TRMC's use of the Amorco Assets and the services provided hereunder and TRMC's Products stored hereunder, and, as applicable, its carriers, customers, representatives, and agents, or those of their respective employees with respect to such matters; and (iv) any losses incurred by any TLO Indemnitee due to violations of this Agreement by TRMC, or, as applicable, its carriers, customers, representatives, and agents;
PROVIDED
THAT
TRMC SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY OR HOLD HARMLESS ANY TLO INDEMNITEE FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT THEY RESULT FROM THE BREACH OF CONTRACT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH TLO INDEMNITEE. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall constitute a release by TRMC of any volume losses that are caused by the TLO's gross negligence, breach of this Agreement or willful misconduct.
(c)    THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSLY NEGOTIATED IN EVERY DETAIL, ARE INTENDED TO BE GIVEN FULL AND LITERAL EFFECT, AND SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS,
16
\36164683.6
LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES OR DAMAGES IN QUESTION ARISE OR AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND CONSTITUTES CONSPICUOUS NOTICE. NOTICE IN THIS CONSPICUOUS NOTICE IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SPECIFIED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.    
(a)
Termination for Default
. A Party shall be in default under this Agreement if:
(i)
the Party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within fifteen (15) Business Days after notice thereof (which notice shall describe such breach in reasonable detail) is received by such Party; or
(ii)
the Party (A) files a petition or otherwise commences, authorizes or acquiesces in the commencement of a proceeding or cause of action under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Applicable Law, or has any such petition filed or commenced against it, (B) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors, (C) otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced) or (D) has a liquidator, administrator, receiver, trustee, conservator or similar official appointed with respect to it or any substantial portion of its property or assets.
If either Party is in default as described above, then (i) if TRMC is in default, TLO may or (ii) if TLO is in default, TRMC may: (1) terminate this Agreement upon notice to the defaulting Party; (2) withhold any payments due to the defaulting Party under this Agreement; and/or (3) pursue any other remedy at law or in equity.
(b)    
Termination due to Rescission by TLO
. In the event that TLO should reasonably determine that the CSLC has finally:
(i)    refused to approve the Lease Renewal for TRMC;
(ii)    refused to approve the Lease Assignment at the time of the Lease Renewal, or earlier if TLO should request that TRMC seek an earlier assignment of the Wharf Lease; or
(iii)    imposed conditions upon the Lease Renewal or Lease Assignment that are unacceptable to TLO and not consistent with current terms (other than increased rent, in accordance with current standards);
and TLO has rescinded the contribution of the Amorco Assets made pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, then TLO may terminate this Agreement effective as of the date of rescission specifically provided for in the Contribution Agreement;
provided
,
however
, that indemnities will remain in place for liabilities and conditions arising prior to the Commencement Date and for liabilities relating to TLO's operation of the Amorco Assets between the Commencement Date and the date of rescission. Revenues
17
\36164683.6
and expenses during the time period between the Commencement Date and the date of rescission will not be refunded or reimbursed.
(c)    
Obligations at Termination
. TRMC shall, upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, promptly remove all of its Products from the Storage Facility and Pipelines within thirty (30) days of such termination or expiration. In the event all of the Product is not removed within such thirty (30) day period, TRMC shall be assessed a holdover storage fee, calculated on the same basis as the Throughput and Tankage Fees, to all Products held in storage more than thirty (30) days beyond the termination or expiration of this Agreement until such time TRMC's entire Product is removed from the Tanks and the Storage Facility.
(d)    
Right to Enter New Agreement
. Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than (x) a default by TRMC, (y) a termination due to rescission, and (y) any other termination of this Agreement initiated by TRMC pursuant to Section 21 or Section 22, TRMC shall have the right to require TLO to enter into a new marine terminal use and throughput agreement with TRMC that (i) is consistent with the terms set forth in this Agreement, (ii) relates to the same Amorco Assets that are the subject matter of this Agreement, and (iii) has commercial terms that are, in the aggregate, equal to or more favorable to TLO than fair market value terms as would be agreed by similarly-situated parties negotiating at arm's length;
provided
,
however
, that the term of any such new marine terminal use and throughput agreement shall not extend
beyond April 30, 2031
.
(e)    
Right of First Refusal
. In the event that TLO proposes to enter into a marine terminal use and throughput agreement with a third party upon the termination of this Agreement for reasons other than (x) by default by TRMC, (y) termination due to rescission, and (z) any other termination of this Agreement initiated by TRMC pursuant to Section 21 or Section 22, TLO shall give TRMC ninety (90) days prior written notice of any proposed new marine terminal use and throughput agreement with a third party, including (i) details of all of the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii) a thirty (30)-day period (beginning upon TRMC's receipt of such written notice) (the 
MTUTA First Offer Period
) in which TRMC may make a good faith offer to enter into a new marine terminal use and throughput agreement with TLO (the 
MTUTA Right of First Refusal
).  If TRMC makes an offer on terms no less favorable to TLO than the third-party offer with respect to such marine terminal use and throughput agreement during the MTUTA First Offer Period, then TLO shall be obligated to enter into a marine terminal use and throughput agreement with TRMC on the terms set forth in subsection (c) above. If TRMC does not exercise its MTUTA Right of First Refusal in the manner set forth above, TLO may, for the next ninety (90) days, proceed with the negotiation of the third-party marine terminal use and throughput agreement. If no third-party marine terminal use and throughput agreement is consummated during such ninety-day period, the terms and conditions of this Section 20(e) shall again become effective. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 20(e) to the contrary, TRMC's MTUTA Right of First Refusal shall only be available and exercisable for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days after termination of this Agreement for reasons other than (x) by default by TRMC, (y) termination due to rescission, and (z) any other termination of this Agreement initiated by TRMC pursuant to Section 21 or Section 22.
(a)    As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure, TLO shall provide TRMC with written notice of the occurrence of such Force Majeure (a 
Force Majeure Notice
). TLO shall identify in such Force Majeure Notice the approximate length of time that TLO reasonably believes in good faith such Force Majeure shall continue (the 
Force Majeure Period
). If TLO is unable to perform or is delayed in performing, in whole or in part, its obligations hereunder as a result of such Force Majeure, then TLO's obligations shall be suspended during, but no longer than, the continuance of such
18
\36164683.6
Force Majeure event, subject to Sections 6(c) through (f) above. If TLO advises in any Force Majeure Notice that it reasonably believes in good faith that the Force Majeure Period shall continue for more than twelve (12) consecutive Months, then, subject to Section 6 above, at any time after TLO delivers such Force Majeure Notice, either Party may terminate that portion of this Agreement relating to the affected Wharf, Pipeline(s) and/or Tank(s) (with a corresponding and pro rata adjustment in the applicable Throughput and Tankage Fees and URPP Use Fee), but only upon delivery to the other Party of a notice (a 
Termination Notice
) at least twelve (12) Months prior to the expiration of the Force Majeure Period;
provided
,
however
; that such Termination Notice shall be deemed cancelled and of no effect if the Force Majeure Period ends prior to the expiration of such twelve-Month period. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Party may exercise its right under this Section 21(a) to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure with respect to any machinery, storage, tanks, lines of pipe or other equipment that has been unaffected by, or has been restored to working order since, the applicable Force Majeure, including pursuant to a Restoration under Section 6.
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if TRMC delivers a Termination Notice to TLO (the 
TRMC Termination Notice
) and, within thirty (30) days after receiving such TRMC Termination Notice, TLO notifies TRMC that TLO reasonably believes in good faith that it shall be capable of fully performing its obligations under this Agreement within a reasonable period of time, then the TRMC Termination Notice shall be deemed revoked and the applicable portion of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such TRMC Termination Notice had never been given.
(a)    In the event that TRMC decides to permanently or indefinitely suspend refining operations at the Refinery for a period that shall continue for at least twelve (12) consecutive Months, TRMC may provide written notice to TLO of TRMC's intent to terminate this Agreement (the 
Suspension Notice
). Such Suspension Notice shall be sent at any time after TRMC has publicly announced such suspension and, upon the expiration of the twelve (12)-Month period following the date such notice is sent (the 
Notice Period
), this Agreement shall terminate. If TRMC publicly announces, more than two (2) Months
prior to the expiration of the Notice Period, its intent to resume operations at the Refinery, then the Suspension Notice shall be deemed revoked, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such Suspension Notice had never been delivered.
(b)    During the Notice Period, TRMC shall remain liable for Monthly payments of the Throughput and Tankage Fees and the URPP Use Fee and any reimbursements or surcharges hereunder.
(c)    During the Notice Period, TLO will not be obligated to provide exclusive dedicated use of the Amorco Assets for TRMC;
provided
,
however
, that TLO shall continue to allow TRMC use of the Amorco Assets on a priority basis, and TLO shall not dedicate any portion of the Amorco Assets to common carrier service without the prior written approval of TRMC, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(d)    Upon the expiration of the Notice Period, this Agreement shall terminate, except as provided in subsection (e) below, and TRMC's approval shall not be required for TLO to dedicate any of the Amorco Assets to common carrier service.
(e)    If the Notice Period shall occur during the Interim Period, then TRMC and TLO shall cooperate in good faith to obtain all required approvals of the CSLC and CDFG and other state agencies to permit the Lease Assignment and COFR Assignment and the transfer of the Pipelines as early as reasonably practicable, but the provisions specified in Section 6 of this Agreement regarding
19
\36164683.6
reimbursement for TRMC's costs as Lessee of the Wharf Lease and owner of the Pipelines shall continue through the Interim Period.
(f)    TRMC is not permitted to suspend or reduce its obligations under this Agreement in connection with a shutdown of the Refinery for scheduled turnarounds or other regular servicing or maintenance. If refining operations at the Refinery are suspended for any reason (including Refinery turnarounds and other scheduled maintenance), then TRMC shall remain liable for the Throughput and Tankage Fees and the URPP Use Fee and any reimbursements or surcharges under this Agreement for the duration of the suspension, unless and until this Agreement is terminated as provided above. TRMC shall provide at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of any suspension of operations at the Refinery due to a planned turnaround or scheduled maintenance.
(a)
TRMC shall not assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without TLO's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided
,
however
, that TRMC may assign this Agreement without TLO's consent in connection with a sale by TRMC of the Refinery so long as the transferee: (i) agrees to assume all of TRMC's obligations under this Agreement and (ii) is financially and operationally capable of fulfilling the terms of this Agreement, which determination shall be made by TRMC in its reasonable judgment.
(b)
TLO shall not assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without TRMC's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided
,
however
, that (i) subject to Section 23(d) below,
TLO may assign this Agreement without TRMC's consent in connection with a sale by TLO of all or substantially all of the Amorco Assets so long as the transferee: (A) agrees to assume all of TLO's obligations under this Agreement; (B) is financially and operationally capable of fulfilling the terms of this Agreement, which determination shall be made by TLO in its reasonable judgment; and (C) is not a competitor of TRMC; and (ii) TLO shall be permitted to make a collateral assignment of this Agreement solely to secure working capital financing for TLO.
(c)
Any assignment that is not undertaken in accordance with the provisions set forth above shall be null and void
ab initio
. A Party making any assignment shall promptly notify the other Party of such assignment, regardless of whether consent is required. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
(d)
In the event that TLO proposes to sell all or substantially all of the Amorco Assets
to a third party, TLO shall give TRMC ninety (90) days' prior written notice of any such sale, including (i) details of all of the material terms and conditions thereof, including without limitation, a firm commitment by a capable third party purchaser to purchase the Amorco Assets at specified price, and (ii) a sixty (60)-day period (beginning upon TRMC's receipt of such written notice) (the 
Purchase First Offer Period
) in which TRMC may make a good faith offer to purchase the Amorco Assets from TLO (the 
Purchase Right of First Refusal
).  If TRMC makes an offer on terms no less favorable to TLO than the third-party offer with respect to such sale during the Purchase First Offer Period, then TLO shall be obligated to sell the Amorco Assets to TRMC on the same terms set forth in such offer to purchase by the third party. If TRMC does not exercise its Purchase Right of First Refusal in the manner set forth above, TLO may, for the next ninety (90) days, proceed with the negotiation of the sale of the Amorco Assets. If such sale is not consummated during such ninety (90) period, the terms and conditions of this Section 23(d) shall again become effective.
20
\36164683.6
(e)
TRMC's obligations hereunder shall not terminate in connection with a Partnership
Change of Control,
provided
,
however
, that in the case of any Partnership Change of Control or the sale of all or substantially all of the Amorco Assets
to a purchaser other than TRMC, TRMC shall retain the option to extend the Term of this Agreement as provided in Section 4, and the Identification Date (as defined in the Omnibus Agreement) shall be deemed to have occurred, if it has not already occurred by reason of the passage of time. TLO shall provide TRMC with notice of any Partnership Change of Control at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date thereof.
24.

Such insurance shall provide coverage to each Party, as applicable, and such policies, other than Worker's Compensation Insurance, shall include each Party as an Additional Insured, as applicable.

(a)
Obligations
. Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to retain the other Parties' Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose the same to any third party nor use the same, except as authorized by the disclosing Party in writing or as expressly permitted in this
Section 26
. Each Party further agrees to take the same care with the other Party's Confidential Information as it does with its own, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Excepted from these obligations of confidence and non-use is that information which:
(i)    is available, or becomes available, to the general public without fault of the receiving Party;
(ii)    was in the possession of the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to receipt of the same from the disclosing Party;
(iii)    is obtained by the receiving Party without an obligation of confidence from a third party who is rightfully in possession of such information and, to the receiving Party's knowledge, is under no obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; or
23
\36164683.6
(iv)    is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to or use of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information.
For the purpose of this
Section 26
, a specific item of Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by, or underlies, more general information in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving Party.
(b)
Required Disclosure
. Notwithstanding Section 26(a) above, if the receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose the Confidential Information by a court, Governmental Authority or Applicable Law, or is required to disclose by the listing standards of any applicable securities exchange, any of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the receiving Party shall promptly advise the disclosing Party of such requirement to disclose Confidential Information as soon as the receiving Party becomes aware that such a requirement to disclose might become effective, in order that, where possible, the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or such other remedy as the disclosing Party may consider appropriate in the circumstances. The receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information that it is required to disclose and shall cooperate with the disclosing Party in allowing the disclosing Party to obtain such protective order or other relief.
(c)
Return of Information
. Upon written request by the disclosing Party, all of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information in whatever form shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed with destruction certified by the receiving Party upon termination of this Agreement, without the receiving Party retaining copies thereof except that one copy of all such Confidential Information may be retained by a Party's legal department solely to the extent that such Party is required to keep a copy of such Confidential Information pursuant to Applicable Law, and the receiving Party shall be entitled to retain any Confidential Information in the electronic form or stored on automatic computer back-up archiving systems during the period such backup or archived materials are retained under such Party's customary procedures and policies;
provided
,
however
, that any Confidential Information retained by the receiving Party shall be maintained subject to confidentiality pursuant to the terms of this Section 26, and such archived or back-up Confidential Information shall not be accessed except as required by Applicable Law.
(d)
Receiving Party Personnel
. The receiving Party will limit access to the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party to those of its employees, attorneys and contractors that have a need to know such information in order for the receiving Party to exercise or perform its rights and obligations under this Agreement (the 
Receiving Party Personnel
). The Receiving Party Personnel who have access to any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party will be made aware of the confidentiality provision of this Agreement, and will be required to abide by the terms thereof. Any third party contractors that are given access to Confidential Information of a disclosing Party pursuant to the terms hereof shall be required to sign a written agreement pursuant to which such Receiving Party Personnel agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, which written agreement will expressly state that it is enforceable against such Receiving Party Personnel by the disclosing Party.
(e)
Survival
. The obligation of confidentiality under this Section 26 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.
27.

Modification; Waiver
. This Agreement may be terminated, amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by the Parties. Any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing at any time by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof. No waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any breach thereof, will be effective unless in writing signed by a
24
\36164683.6
duly authorized individual on behalf of the Party against which the waiver is sought to be enforced.

Tesoro Marine Vessel Vetting Process
Tesoro Corporation (Tesoro) is a San Antonio, Texas based refining and marketing company with deepwater access refineries and/or terminals in Nikiski, Alaska; Anacortes Washington; Martinez, California; Los Angeles, California, and Kapolei, Hawaii.
VETTING POLICY
All vessels must be vetted and accepted before they can be approved to berth at a facility owned or operated by Tesoro.
Vetting is used to determine the suitability and acceptability/non-acceptability of a vessel with the following objectives:
VETTING PROCESS
Vetting is performed by the Tesoro Vetting group utilizing a dedicated vetting program designed and maintained by Marine Information Systems. The program is called Tesoro Assessment & Ship Clearance (TASC), and it is internet based and provides a central process and record of all vetting activity. TASC includes direct links with Lloyds List Intelligence and Q88.com as well as links with SIRE, USCG PSIX, Equasis, Paris MOU, Tokyo MOU, Indian Ocean MOU and other sites that may be useful in the vetting process. TASC also includes a Terminal/Superintendent feedback capability which is an important element of the vetting process.
Vetting requests must be submitted in TASC by Tesoro personnel.
When a vessel is submitted for a vetting clearance the owner or operator must provide or update the following to the Terminal scheduler (as indicated in Annex B) with carbon copy to
vetting@tsocorp.com
:
The vetting process includes numerous factors such as those listed below, but may include other considerations as circumstances warrant:

Exhibit 99.1
TESORO CORPORATION CONTRIBUTES MARTINEZ CRUDE OIL MARINE TERMINAL
TO TESORO LOGISTICS
Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) and Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) today announced that Tesoro Corporation (Tesoro) has contributed the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal located in Martinez, California to Tesoro Logistics LP (the Partnership) for total consideration of $75 million, effective April 1, 2012.
The contribution of the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal marks Tesoro's first drop-down to the Partnership and demonstrates Tesoro's commitment to capturing the full value of our logistics assets and helping the Partnership expand its portfolio, said Greg Goff, Tesoro Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tesoro Logistics' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We are committed to growing the Partnership's distributions and expect this transaction to be immediately accretive.
The Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal is located on the Sacramento River near Tesoro's Martinez refinery and consists of a single-berth dock, five crude oil storage tanks with a combined 425,000 barrels of capacity and related pipelines. The terminal receives crude oil through marine vessels for delivery to Tesoro's Martinez refinery. Total throughput capacity for the terminal is approximately 145,000 barrels per day.
The purchase price of $75 million included cash of $67.5 million and Tesoro Logistics equity valued at approximately $7.5 million. The cash consideration was financed with borrowings under Tesoro Logistics' revolving credit facility. The equity consideration was based on the average daily closing price for the 10 trading days prior to the effective date of April 1, 2012, or $35.62 per unit, with 98% in the form of common units and 2% in the form of general partner units.
In connection with the closing of the proposed transaction, Tesoro and the Partnership have entered into a 10-year terminalling agreement with a minimum throughput commitment. Tesoro Logistics expects that this contribution will result in an estimated $15 million of incremental revenue, of which more than 90% is based on minimum committed throughput, and $8 million of incremental annual EBITDA.
On March 30, 2012, the Partnership amended its senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A, as administrative agent and a syndicate of banks and financial institutions and lenders. Concurrent with the execution of the amendment, the Partnership exercised its option to increase the size of the loan commitments to an aggregate of $300 million. Additionally, the Partnership is permitted to request that the loan commitments under the Credit Agreement be increased up to an aggregate of $450 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by all of the Partnership's subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on April 25, 2014.
