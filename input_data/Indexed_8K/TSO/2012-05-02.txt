Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Reports First Quarter 2012 Results
SAN ANTONIO - May 2, 2012
- Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported first quarter 2012 net income of $56 million, or $0.39 per diluted share compared to net income of $107 million, or $0.74 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2011.
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect a solid operating performance and continued execution of our strategic plan, said Greg Goff, President and CEO. We completed nearly half of our planned turnaround activity for 2012 during the quarter; made significant progress on our high-return capital program; further strengthened our refining and marketing integration; and completed the first asset drop-down to Tesoro Logistics.
For the first quarter, the Company recorded segment operating income of $187 million, compared to segment operating income of $305 million in the first quarter of 2011. The year-over-year decline in operating income was driven primarily by major turnaround activity in the California region.
The Tesoro Index of $10.10 per barrel (/bbl), for the first quarter, was down about fifty cents from a year ago. Lower year-over-year light product crack spreads in California negatively impacted the index in the quarter. West Coast benchmark diesel crack spreads were down 13% year-over-year while gasoline crack spreads lost 3%. Partially off-setting these detriments, however, were additional feedstock cost advantage in the mid-continent and Pacific Northwest, resulting in a gross margin of $12.15/bbl.

Driving the Company's positive margin performance relative to the Tesoro Index were advantaged crude oil discounts compared to benchmark grades of crude oil. Partially off-setting these benefits, however, were negative product yield impacts associated with the turnaround activity in the California region. On the West Coast, foreign heavy crude oil continued to price at a discount to domestic alternatives. In the mid-continent region, crude oil priced off of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at a discount to Brent. Total throughput in the quarter was 529 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) or 80% utilization, driven by the turnaround activity which was completed in March. The Company expects throughput in the second quarter 2012 of about 580 mbpd, or 87% utilization, which includes the impact associated with the majority of the remaining 2012 turnaround plan.
Despite the lower throughput, direct manufacturing costs in the first quarter averaged $4.97/bbl, slightly below fourth quarter 2011.
Retail fuel sales volumes were up 7% year-over-year driven by the Company's recently acquired Albertson's Fuel Express retail stations and the addition of the Shell wholesale supply contracts during the first quarter last year. Same store fuel sales during the quarter were down about 1% on a year-over-year basis. Retail fuel margins were down during the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year. This is typical in a rising price environment where street prices tend to lag increases in wholesale spot prices.
Corporate and unallocated costs, net of $2 million of corporate depreciation and excluding a $12 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense associated with stock appreciation rights, were $39 million in the first quarter.

Refining and Marketing Integration
During the first quarter 2012, Tesoro closed on the purchase of 49 Albertson's Fuel Express retail stations from SUPERVALU, Inc. (NYSE: SVU). These stations are located in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming with expected total fuel sales of about 5 mbpd.
During the month of April, Tesoro started taking possession of retail stations primarily in Southern California from Thrifty Oil Co., per the lease agreement announced in September 2011. Tesoro expects to take possession of the stations in a phased process, with approximately 175 stations scheduled to be transferred to Tesoro during the second and third quarters of 2012 and the balance of approximately 50 stations in 2014. The Thrifty retail network, which is under lease agreement with an initial term of ten years, is expected to provide total fuel sales of between 20 and 25 mbpd.
These transactions add ratable and profitable supply outlets, further strengthening our refining and marketing integration, said Goff.
Value-Driven Growth in Logistics
On April 2, 2012, Tesoro Corporation and Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) announced that Tesoro Corporation contributed the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal to Tesoro Logistics LP (the Partnership) for total consideration of $75 million, effective April 1, 2012.
The contribution of the Martinez Crude Oil Marine Terminal marks Tesoro's first drop-down to the Partnership and demonstrates Tesoro's commitment to capturing the full value of our logistics assets. As the Partnership expands its portfolio and grows cash distributions to unitholders, significant value accrues to Tesoro through its 52% equity ownership, said Goff.

The purchase price of $75 million included cash of $67.5 million and Tesoro Logistics equity valued at approximately $7.5 million. The cash consideration was financed with borrowings under Tesoro Logistics' revolving credit facility, which was expanded to an aggregate of $300 million, concurrent with the transaction.
Capital Spending and Liquidity
Capital spending for the first quarter was $139 million, including $37 million for the retail acquisition. Turnaround spending was $126 million. Expectations for full year 2012 capital and turnaround spending remain at $670 million and $300 million, respectively. The Company ended the first quarter with $710 million in cash on the balance sheet and remained undrawn with $819 million of availability on the Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility. Tesoro Panama and Tesoro Logistics LP ended the quarter with $90 million and $50 million borrowed, respectively, on their separate credit facilities.
