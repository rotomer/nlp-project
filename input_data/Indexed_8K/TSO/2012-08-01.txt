Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2012 Results
SAN ANTONIO - August 1, 2012
- Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported second quarter 2012 net income of $387 million, or $2.75 per diluted share compared to net income of $218 million, or $1.52 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011.
The 2012 results include after-tax expenses totaling $0.08 per diluted share related to legal matters, primarily the settlement of the claims arising from the April 2010 incident at our Anacortes, Washington refinery. Additionally, these results include after-tax expenses totaling $0.04 per diluted share related to a change in benefits for retirement eligible employees. Excluding these items, the Company earned $404 million, or $2.87 per diluted share.
We are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, said Greg Goff, President and CEO. Despite significant planned turnaround activity, we delivered a solid operating performance capturing attractive market conditions and building cash by more than $600 million during the quarter.
1
For the quarter, the Company recorded segment operating income of $728 million, excluding special items, compared to segment operating income of $448 million, excluding special items, in the second quarter of 2011. The year-over-year improvement in operating income was driven by strong operational reliability, improved market conditions and advantaged crude oil discounts.
The second quarter Tesoro Index of $14.90 per barrel (/bbl) was up $2.75/bbl from a year ago. Higher year-over-year West Coast benchmark gasoline crack spreads, which were up over 25% in California and nearly 50% in the Pacific Northwest, positively impacted the Tesoro Index in the quarter. Reliable operations throughout the system and additional feedstock cost advantage in the mid-continent and Pacific Northwest drove incremental improvement, resulting in a gross margin of $20.32/bbl.
Driving the Company's strong margin performance relative to the Tesoro Index were advantaged crude oil discounts compared to benchmark grades of crude oil. On the West Coast, foreign heavy and Canadian light sweet crude oil continued to price at a discount to domestic alternatives. In the mid-continent region, crude oil priced off of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) continued to trade at a discount to Brent. Total throughput in the quarter was 579 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) or 87% utilization. Excluding the Hawaiian and Alaskan operations, which were impacted by planned turnaround activity, utilization was 98%.
Direct manufacturing costs in the second quarter averaged $4.69/bbl, excluding special items, down relative to the first quarter of this year, benefiting from the continued cost improvement in the California region.
2
Retail fuel sales volumes were up 11% year-over-year driven by the addition of 165 retail stations from Thrifty Oil Co. in the second quarter and the 49 Albertson's Fuel Express retail stations acquired in the first quarter of this year. The additional ratable and profitable volumes were a result of the Company's strategic focus on refining and marketing integration. Same store fuel sales during the quarter were higher by about 2% on a year-over-year basis. Retail fuel margins were up during the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year.
Corporate and unallocated costs, net of $6 million of corporate depreciation and excluding $7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation credit associated with variable share-based awards, were $39 million in the second quarter.
Refining and Marketing Integration
During the second quarter, Tesoro took possession of 165 retail stations primarily in Southern California from Thrifty Oil Co., per the lease agreement announced in September 2011. Tesoro expects to take possession of nine additional stations in the third quarter of 2012 and the balance of approximately 50 stations in 2014. The Thrifty retail network, which is under lease agreement with an initial term of ten years, is expected to provide total fuel sales of between 20 and 25 mbpd, further strengthening the Company's refining and marketing integration.
Value-Driven Growth
Tesoro has made significant progress on its large capital refinery projects. At the end of the second quarter, the Company completed the 10 mbpd expansion of the Mandan, North Dakota refinery and today that facility is running at full capacity of 68 mbpd, capturing a significant feedstock advantage.

Additionally, the Company expects to load the first unit train with advantaged Bakken crude oil destined for the Anacortes, Washington refinery in August. The project to build a rail unloading facility, with current permitted capacity of 50 mbpd, is nearing the estimated September completion.
Tesoro Corporation today announced that the Company intends to offer its Long Beach marine terminal and Los Angeles short-haul pipelines to Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE: TLLP). These assets, located near the Company's Wilmington, California refinery, consist of a two-vessel berth dock leased from the City of Long Beach, six storage tanks with combined capacity of 235,000 barrels and six related pipelines with 70 mbpd throughput connecting the marine terminal, Tesoro's refinery and other third party facilities.
These assets have expected annual logistics EBITDA in the $20 to $25 million range and include significant third party revenue. While the purchase price has not yet been negotiated, the Company expects to enter into terminalling and throughput agreements with minimum volume commitments, consistent with prior transactions. The Company expects to close the sale during the third quarter 2012.
Today, Tesoro Corporation reaffirmed its intention to offer the Anacortes, Washington unit train unloading facility to TLLP. The unloading facility, which is expected to be operational in the third quarter 2012, should generate an expected annual logistics EBITDA in the $15 to $20 million range. Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter 2012 and include corresponding throughput and minimum volume commitment agreements.

Capital Spending and Liquidity
Capital spending for the second quarter was $148 million. Turnaround spending was $64 million. Expectations for full year 2012 capital spending remain at $670 million. Turnaround spending in 2012 is currently estimated to be approximately $260 million, down $40 million from prior guidance. The Company ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and remained undrawn with nearly $950 million of availability on the Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility. Tesoro Panama and Tesoro Logistics LP ended the quarter with $50 million and $118 million borrowed, respectively, on their separate credit facilities.
Tesoro Corporation intends to redeem the remaining 6 % senior notes due in November of 2012.
Cash Return to Shareholders
Tesoro Corporation today announced that the Company's board of directors has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. The shares will be repurchased at management's discretion in the open market. The authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The dividend is payable on September 14, 2012 to holders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2012.
Our priorities for cash include maintaining strong liquidity and leverage below 30%, then investing in growth opportunities that drive value creation and returning excess cash flow to shareholders, said Goff. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong and we're investing in high-return, short pay-back projects that will drive fundamental improvements in our business and deliver further cash flow growth.

We're now well positioned to begin returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and a regular dividend. The dividend signals our confidence in future free cash flows while the share repurchase program signals our confidence in the future value of Tesoro.
