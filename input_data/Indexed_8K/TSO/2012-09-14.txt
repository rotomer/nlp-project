Effective September 14, 2012, Tesoro Corporation ("Tesoro") entered into a transaction (the "Sale") with Tesoro Logistics LP (the "Partnership" or "TLLP"), Tesoro Logistics GP LLC (the "General Partner"), Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company ("TRMC") and Tesoro Logistics Operations LLC (the "Operating Company") pursuant to which TRMC sold, through the General Partner and the Partnership to the Operating Company, the marine terminal leased from the City of Long Beach, California and related assets, upon the completion of certain approvals discussed below, as well as the Los Angeles short-haul pipelines.
The Sale was made in exchange for consideration from the Partnership to the General Partner of $210 million, comprised of $189 million in cash and the issuance of equity with a combined fair value of $21 million. The equity is comprised of 9,446 general partner units and 462,825 common units representing an approximate 1% limited partner interest in the Partnership.
The Long Beach assets consist of:
1.        The marine terminal leased from the City of Long Beach, California ("Long Beach Marine Terminal") consisting of a dock ("Dock") with two vessel berths ("Berths") and various fixtures and improvements located in, on and around the Dock, including piping, loading arms and sheds (together with the Berths and the Dock, the "Wharf"). The Berths receive crude oil and other feedstocks from marine vessels for delivery to TRMC's Wilmington refinery located in Wilmington, California ("Refinery") and other third-party refineries and terminals, and receive refined and intermediate products from the Refinery for delivery to marine vessels. The Wharf is located on lands leased by TRMC from the City of Long Beach, California under a term lease (the "Terminal Lease"). Following approval from the City of Long Beach, California, the Terminal Lease and the leasehold interests in the Wharf are expected to be assigned or subleased to the Operating Company.
2.        Six staging tanks at the Wharf with an aggregate shell capacity of 235,000 barrels for the storage of intermediate and refined petroleum products, along with related hydrocarbon transfer pumps, piping, sheds and equipment (including electrical switching and communications facilities and equipment) for such staging tanks (collectively, the "Staging Facility").
3.        The pipeline system located in the Los Angeles, California metropolitan area consisting of three separate U.S. Department of Transportation-regulated pipelines, each approximately 1.6 miles in length, that transport crude oil, feedstocks and refined petroleum products between the Refinery and the Long Beach Marine Terminal and various third party facilities, together with the associated permits, rights of way and easements ("Wharf Pipelines"). The operation of the Staging Facility and the Wharf Pipelines by the Operating Company will require a Certificate of Financial Responsibility ("COFR") issued by the California Department of Fish and Game ("CDFG"). It is intended that the COFR will be issued at the same time as the assignment or sublease of the Terminal Lease.
4.        One jet fuel pipeline ("Jet Fuel Pipeline") and one gasoline/diesel pipeline (together with the Jet Fuel Pipeline, the "LAR Short-Haul Pipelines"), both of which connect to a petroleum products terminal in Carson, California that is owned and operated by Shell Oil Products US.
5.        One pipeline segment that connects a third-party pipeline to the Kinder Morgan Carson Terminal and runs through the Refinery property, for which TRMC established a use license agreement with a third-party for light product movements effective May 1, 2009 through December 1, 2013 (the "810 Pipeline").
The Long Beach Marine Terminal will be conveyed upon completion of the sublease or assignment of the Terminal Lease and the issuance of the COFR. The Wharf Pipelines and LAR Short-Haul Pipelines will be conveyed to the Operating Company upon the receipt of all requisite easements, rights of way and property agreements. The estimated remaining useful life of all assets contributed ranges from 1 to 28 years.
Tesoro issued a press release on September 14, 2012, announcing the transaction, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
In connection with the Sale, Tesoro entered into the following material definitive agreements:

Long Beach Berth Access Use and Throughput Agreement
On September 14, 2012, in connection with the Sale, TRMC entered into a berth access use and throughput agreement with the Operating Company (the "BAUTA"), to be effective on the date on which the assignment or sublease of the Terminal Lease, as applicable, takes effect (the "Commencement Date").

Under the BAUTA, TRMC is obligated to transport an aggregate volume of at least 1,520,833 barrels of crude oil and refined products per month across the Berths at a throughput fee of $0.40 per barrel (the "Throughput Volume Fee"). TRMC is also obligated to throughput (i) an aggregate volume of 912,500 barrels of crude oil and refined products between the Long Beach Marine Terminal and the Refinery from the Commencement Date through December 31, 2014 and (ii) an aggregate volume of 1,520,833 barrels of crude oil and refined products per month between the Long Beach Marine Terminal and the Refinery from January 1, 2015 through the termination of the BAUTA, each at a fee of $0.10 per barrel (the "Pipeline Use Fee"). TRMC is subject to (i) a $0.15 per barrel use fee for marine vapor recovery throughput at the Long Beach Marine Terminal, and (ii) a $0.70 per barrel storage and transportation fee for the use of the 235,000 shell capacity of the staging facility. The fees under the agreement are indexed for inflation. The initial term of the BAUTA is ten years from the Commencement Date and TRMC, at its sole option, may extend the term for two renewal terms of five years each, or, it may modify the term of the BAUTA to a twenty year term by providing notice to the Operating Company no later than the fifth anniversary of the Commencement Date.
If TRMC does not transport aggregate volumes equal to the minimum throughput commitments described above during any calendar month, TRMC shall pay the Operating Company a shortfall payment equal to the difference between the minimum throughput commitments described above and the actual volume received during the month multiplied by the Throughput Volume Fee or the Pipeline Use Fee, as applicable. The amount of any shortfall payment paid by TRMC will be credited against any amounts owed by TRMC for the transportation of volumes in excess of its minimum throughput commitments during any of the succeeding three months.

As a result, certain individuals, including officers and directors of Tesoro and the General Partner, serve as officers and/or directors of more than one of such other entities.

Financing Agreements
On September 14, 2012, the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiary Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp. (together with the Partnership, the "Issuers") closed their previously announced offering (the "Offering") of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Senior Notes") pursuant to a private placement transaction conducted under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Partnership used the proceeds from the Offering to fund a cash payment of $189 million in connection with the Sale, to repay approximately $118 million of outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and the Sale. All remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes.
Senior Notes and Indenture
The Senior Notes were issued under and are governed by an indenture, dated as of September 14, 2012 (the "Indenture"), by and among the Issuers, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee ("Trustee"), and certain of the Partnership's existing subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). The Indenture contains customary terms, events of default and covenants relating to, among other things, making investments, incurring additional indebtedness or issuing preferred units, paying dividends or making distributions on units or redeeming or repurchasing subordinated debt, creating liens, incurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries, selling assets, merging or consolidating with other entities and entering into transactions with affiliates. On or after October 1, 2016, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 102.938% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any, such optional redemption prices decreasing to 101.469% on or after October 1, 2017, and 100.000% on or after October 1, 2018. Prior to October 1, 2015, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at 105.875% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any. Prior to October 1, 2016, the Issuers may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a make-whole price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any. If a change of control occurs, the holders of the Senior Notes may require the Issuers to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any.
The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers' existing and future senior debt and senior to any future indebtedness of the Issuers that expressly provides for subordination to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors. The guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior debt of the Guarantors and senior to any future indebtedness of the Guarantors that expressly provides for subordination to the guarantees. The Senior Notes and guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt, to the extent of the assets securing such debt, including indebtedness under the Partnership's revolving credit agreement.
The foregoing summaries of the Indenture and the Senior Notes do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture, which includes the form of the certificate for the Senior Notes, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the Offering, the Issuers and the Guarantors entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of September 14, 2012, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuers and the Guarantors have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Senior Notes for substantially identical notes (other than with respect to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate) that are registered under the Securities Act so as to permit the exchange offer to be consummated by the 365th day after September 14, 2012. Under specified circumstances, the Issuers and Guarantors have also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Notes. The Issuers will be obligated to pay additional interest if they fail to comply with their obligations to register the Notes within the specified time periods.
The foregoing summary of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.2 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Opinion of Counsel nor an Officers' Certificate, nor a board resolution, shall be required in connection with the addition of a Guarantor under this Indenture upon execution and delivery by such Guarantor, the Issuers and the Trustee of a supplemental indenture to this Indenture, the form of which is attached as Exhibit D hereto.
 
Section 9.02
With Consent of Holders of Notes.
Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Issuers and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture (including, without limitation, Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof) and the Notes and the Note Guarantees with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium or interest and Special Interest, if any, on, the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes or the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Section 2.08 hereof shall determine which Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this Section 9.02.
Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of their Boards of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee will join with the Issuers and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
It is not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Issuers will mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Issuers to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then-outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Issuers with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes or the Note Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes; ,, that any purchase or repurchase of Notes, including pursuant to Sections 4.10 or 4.15 hereof, shall not be deemed a redemption of the Notes;
provided
however
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest or Special Interest, if any, on any Note;
(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, and Special Interest, if any, or premium on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
(5) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Notes;
 
(6) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest and Special Interest, if any, or premium, if any, on, the Notes (other than as permitted by clause (7) below);
(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Sections 4.10 or 4.15 hereof);
(8) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; or
(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
Section 9.03
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes will be set forth in an amended or supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
Section 9.04
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms (except as provided in the second succeeding paragraph) and thereafter binds every Holder.
The Issuers may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the second to last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies) and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment or waiver or revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of the clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02, in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder of a note who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same indebtedness as the consenting Holder's Note.
Section 9.05
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuers in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
Section 9.06
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
The Trustee will sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Issuers may not sign an amended or supplemental indenture until the Boards of Directors of each of the Issuers approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) will be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 12.04 hereof, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental
 
indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Opinion of Counsel nor an Officers' Certificate, nor a board resolution, shall be required for the Trustee to execute any supplemental indenture to this Indenture, the form of which is attached as Exhibit D hereto, adding a new Guarantor under this Indenture.
Section 10.01
Guarantee.
(a) Subject to this Article 10, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees, in an unsecured senior basis, to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Issuers hereunder or thereunder, that:
(1) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest and Special Interest, if any, on, the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Issuers to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
(2) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
(b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuers, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by law, hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of an Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against an Issuer, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Note Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture.
(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to an Issuer, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to any of the Issuers or the Guarantors, any amount paid by an Issuer or any Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full force and effect.
(d) Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of its Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed thereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee. The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.
 
Section 10.02
Limitation on Guarantor Liability.
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Section 10.03
Note Guarantee Evidenced by Indenture; No Notation of Subsidiary Guarantee.
The Note Guarantee of any Guarantor shall be evidenced solely by its execution and delivery of this Indenture (or, in the case of any Guarantor that is not party to this Indenture on the date of this Indenture, a supplemental indenture hereto) and not by an endorsement on, or attachment to, any Note of any Note Guarantee or notation thereof. To effect any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor not party to this Indenture on the date of this Indenture, such future Guarantor shall execute and deliver a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D hereto, which supplemental indenture shall be executed and delivered on behalf of such Guarantor by an Officer of such Guarantor.
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01 hereof will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on any Note a notation of such Note Guarantee.
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of each of the Guarantors.
Section 10.04
Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.05 hereof, no Guarantor may sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Issuers or another Guarantor, unless:
(1) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
(2) either:
(a) subject to Section 10.05 hereof, the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger is a Guarantor, or unconditionally assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under this Indenture, its Note Guarantee and the Registration Rights Agreement on the terms set forth herein or therein, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; or
(b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation, Section 4.10 hereof.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person will succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon
 
may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuers and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clauses 2(a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes will prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Issuers or another Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuers or another Guarantor.
Section 10.05
Releases.

Upon delivery by the Issuers to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Issuers in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10 hereof, the Trustee will execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee.

provided

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit) and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other material instrument to which any Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which any Issuer or any Guarantor is bound;

provided
however
(b) Each Participant, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, the Guarantors, their respective directors (or equivalent), their respective officers who sign any Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls either Issuer or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Issuers, the Guarantors or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus, (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Participant, furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Participant, specifically for use therein or (iii) an offer or sale of Securities or Exchange Securities occurring during a Shelf Suspension Period by a Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer to whom the Issuers theretofore provided notice thereof pursuant to Section 6(c) hereof; and subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will reimburse, as incurred, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the Issuers, the Guarantors or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending against or appearing as a third party
 
witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. The indemnity provided for in this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that the Participants may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. A Participant shall not be liable under this Section 8 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by the Participants, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of such Participant, effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such Participant is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Participant, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of such Participant, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Participant, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of such Participant.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof in writing; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest (based on the advice of counsel to the indemnified person); (ii) such action includes both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded (based on the advice of counsel to the indemnified person) that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice
provided
however
 
of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or separate but related or substantially similar proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction) representing the indemnified parties under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this Section 8, as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions. Any such separate firm for any Participants shall be designated in writing by Participants who sold a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities and Exchange Securities sold by all such Participants in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 8 or the Issuers in the case of paragraph (b) of this Section 8. In the event that any Participants are indemnified persons collectively entitled, in connection with a proceeding or separate but related or substantially similar proceedings in a single jurisdiction, to the payment of fees and expenses of a single separate firm under this Section 8(c), and any such Participants cannot agree to a mutually acceptable separate firm to act as counsel thereto, then such separate firm for all such Indemnified Persons shall be designated in writing by Participants who sold a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities and Exchange Securities sold by all such Participants. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any statement as to, or any admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. All fees and expenses reimbursed pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be reimbursed as they are incurred and following a written request therefor.
(d) After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the third sentence of paragraph (c) of this Section 8 or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. After such notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnified party waived in writing its rights under this Section 8, in which case the indemnified party may effect such a settlement without such consent.
 
(e) In circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 8 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (other than for the reasons specified in Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof, including by virtue of the failure of an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of its right to indemnification pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, where such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party (through the forfeiture of substantial rights or defenses)), each indemnifying party, in order to provide for just and equitable contribution, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof). The relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and such Participant on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion that the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) of the Securities received by the Issuers bear to the total discounts and commissions received by such Participant in connection with the initial sale of the Securities by the Issuers (or if such Participant did not receive discounts or commissions, the value or receiving the Securities). The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand, or the Participants on the other hand, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. The parties agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (e). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (e), no Participant shall be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation or net proceeds, as applicable, on the sale of Securities received by such Participant in connection with the sale of the Securities, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Participant has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact, and no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (e), each person, if any, who controls a Participant within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Participants, and each director, member or manager, as applicable, of each of the Issuers
 
and the Guarantors, each officer of each of the Issuers and the Guarantors and each person, if any, who controls any of the Issuers and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuers and the Guarantors.
 
The Issuers covenant and agree that they will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to file the reports required to be filed by them under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, if at any time the Issuers are not required to file such reports and do not otherwise file such reports pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuers will, upon the request of any Holder or beneficial owner of Registrable Securities, make available such information necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144A. The Issuers further covenant and agree, for so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding that they will take such further action as any Holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144A unless the Issuers and the Guarantors are then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise file such reports pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and reports filed thereunder satisfy the information requirements of Rule 144A then in effect.
 
The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not be required to assist in an underwritten offering unless requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities. If any of the Registrable Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable Securities included in such offering and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Issuers and the Guarantors.
No Holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
 
(a) . Neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor has, as of the date hereof, and the Issuers and the Guarantors shall not, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is
No Inconsistent Agreements
 
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Issuers other issued and outstanding securities, if any, under any such agreements. The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities which will grant to any Person piggy-back registration rights with respect to any Registration Statement.
(b) . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, otherwise than with the prior written consent of (I) the Issuers and the Guarantors, and (II) (A) the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Registrable Securities and (B) in circumstances that would adversely affect the Participating Broker-Dealers, the Participating Broker-Dealers holding not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Exchange Notes held by all Participating Broker-Dealers; , , that Section 8 hereof and this Section 11(b) may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior written consent of each Holder and each Participating Broker-Dealer (including any person who was a Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer of Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities, as the case may be, disposed of pursuant to any Registration Statement) affected by any such amendment, modification or supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders of Registrable Securities whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other Holders of Registrable Securities may be given by Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold pursuant to such Registration Statement; and , , that no consent is necessary from any Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer in the event this Agreement is amended, modified or supplemented for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer (as applicable).

If needed, up to two calendar years of actual throughput data prior to the Commencement Date year may be used to determine the average of Customer's Percentage Allocation for the two calendar years before the year in which a Project is completed. If, however, Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC for a Project is to be paid for through PCR payments (as defined and pursuant to subparagraph 7(b)(ii) below), and during any calendar year there are cumulative changes in Customer's Percentage Allocation in an amount greater than ten percent (10%), then the outstanding principal balance of Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC will be adjusted up or down at the start of the next calendar year to correspond to the cumulative changes, but subject to terms and conditions of subparagraph 7(b)(ii)(2)(III) below;
multiplied
 
(iii) Operator shall provide Customer with reasonable supporting information and cost accounting for: its expenses relating to the MPC; the basis for determining Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC; that, Operator will not be required to divulge any information in violation of any applicable anti-competition laws, rules or regulations.

provided
(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, Customer will have the right to review and consent to the scope, design or implementation of a Project; provided, however, (x) Operator will provide Customer regular updates of Project scope and design and obtain Customer consent to scope and cost at each stage of the Project design for all Projects with estimated cost in excess of $100,000, (y) Operator will provide Customer a written summary of any Project (including a +/-10% cost estimate for the Project) at least 90 days prior to commencement of construction of the Project, and (z) Operator and Customer shall meet to discuss Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC at least 30 days prior to commencement of construction of the Project. Operator shall design and construct the Project in accordance with customary industry standards and the requirements of the applicable Governmental Authority.
(b) . Customer may, at its option, elect to pay Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC for a Project by one of the two following methods, to be selected on or before the date Operator begins construction work on a Project:
MPC Payment Methods
(i) Customer may pay Operator the Customer's Proportionate Share of the MPC in full upon completion of the applicable Project; or
(ii) Customer may pay Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC in Monthly installments (the "" or "") pursuant to the following conditions:
Project Cost Reimbursements
PCR
(1) The PCR payment obligation shall commence upon completion of the applicable Project, with the first PCR payment to be made in accordance with the first regular Monthly invoice delivered by Operator following completion of the Project.
(2) The outstanding principal balance of Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC shall bear interest at the lesser of a per annum rate of fifteen percent (15%) or the highest rate of interest (if any) permitted by Applicable Law, and shall be repaid in equal Monthly installments of principal and interest, with such payment to be based on the outstanding principal balance of Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC amortized over (A) five (5) years, or (B) the number of years remaining in the Term, whichever time period is shorter; , , that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 4, 20, 21 or 28(a), then the remaining unpaid principal balance of Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC will be due and payable pursuant to the following conditions:
provided
however
(I) If, upon termination of this Agreement, Operator has not replaced Customer's Annual Minimum Throughput Volume with a new third-party take or pay commitment for use of the Wharf, then the remaining unpaid principal balance of Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC will be due and payable by Customer upon the date of such termination.
(II) Except as provided in subparagraph (III) below, if upon termination of this Agreement, Operator has replaced Customer's Annual Minimum Throughput Volume with a new third-party take or pay commitment for use of the Wharf, then Customer's remaining unpaid balance will be reduced by the percentage of Customer's Annual Minimum Throughput Volume replaced
 
by such new third party, up to a maximum of 100% of the remaining unpaid balance, with any remaining unpaid balance to be due and payable on the date of such termination. In other words, and by way of example only, if Operator replaces 9,125,000 Barrels per year of Annual Minimum Throughput Volume with a new take or pay commitment upon termination, then Customer's remaining unpaid balance would be reduced by 50% (9,125,000 Barrels per year /18,250,000 Barrels per year = 50%), and the remaining 50% unpaid balance would be due and payable by Customer upon the date of such termination.
(III) The extent to which new third-party commitments are considered new commitments eligible to reduce the unpaid balance of Customer's Proportionate Share of MPC, as set forth in subparagraph (II) immediately above, shall be determined as the difference between the throughput commitments for the calendar year preceding the date the notice of cancellation is delivered minus the total committed throughput volumes during the first calendar year after cancellation of this Agreement.
(c) . Attached hereto as is a non-exhaustive list of the types of Projects Operator anticipates will generate MPC over the Term of this Agreement. Such list may be amended, restated, modified, or supplemented by Operator from time to time over the Term without the need for an amendment to this Agreement.
Anticipated Projects
Schedule 7(C)
(d) . Any MPC required by the POLB, any state or federal agencies, or any other Governmental Authority, including without limitation, MPC associated with shore side pumping or emission reduction requirements, which are attributable to specific Projects relating to the installation of Customer's pipeline tie-in or other similar Customer Projects will be 100% allocable to and reimbursed by Customer. Customer shall pay such reimbursements either on an ongoing basis or upon Project completion, as Operator shall elect in its commercially reasonable discretion. Subsequent requirements by Governmental Authority which require MPC will be reimbursed as determined in Section 7.

SECTION 8 ADJUSTMENTS  FEES AND COSTS
(a) .
Fee Adjustments
(i) Starting July 1, 2013, the Schedule 6(A) Flat Rate Fees and all fees in Section 5(a) above shall automatically be increased on the first day of July for each year of the Term, by a percentage equal to the greater of zero or the positive change in the CPI-U for the prior calendar year, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent.
(ii) The MTVF will be adjusted upon the Lease Assignment or Sublease, as applicable, and any renewal, reopening, or fee adjustment of Lease HD-2114 if Operator's payment obligations thereunder change such that Operator's Term and non-Term throughput pass-through fees are insufficient to meet Operator's minimum guaranteed payment obligation to the POLB. Any such adjustment(s) is to be commensurate with any percentage change greater than zero percent (0%) to Operator's guaranteed minimum payment obligations thereunder.
(b) . If, at any time during a Contract Year, Operator determines in its commercially reasonable discretion that the then-applicable OCR is not sufficient in amount to reflect Operator's actual operating costs for the Wharf and Ancillary Facilities, then Operator may revise the OCR by providing Customer with 30-days prior written notice of such revised OCR, such notice to contain all reasonable backup information in respect of the revised OCR.
OCR Adjustments
 
(c) . If, at any time during a Contract Year, the total per-Barrel fee paid by Customer to throughput Product across the Berths (including the MTVF, any pass-through costs, any OCR, any MPC, and any other fees) exceeds the total fees paid by any customer, other than Shell Lubes, for use of the Berths, Dock, Wharf, or Marine Terminal, then Operator shall refund Customer, on a per-Barrel basis, any excess paid by Customer in such Contract Year. In such event, Operator shall adjust Customer's future fees such that Customer's total per-Barrel fees are no more than any customer, other than Shell Lubes, at the Berths, Dock, Wharf, or Marine Terminal.
Total Fee Adjustment
SECTION 9 PAYMENTS
(a) . If the Minimum Marine Throughput Volume and/or the Minimum Pipeline Throughput Volume are not met, then Customer shall receive a "" calculated as the difference between actual total volumes received during such Month and the Minimum Marine Throughput Volume and/or the Minimum Pipeline Throughput Volume multiplied by the sum of the MTVF and/or the Pipeline Use Fee, each on a per Barrel basis.
Monthly Shortfall Credit
Shortfall Credit
(b) . Actual volumes of Barrels throughput across the Berths are to be determined Monthly, based upon Marine Vessel deliveries, Marine Vessel receipts and Pipeline transfers during that Month and credited towards the Minimum Marine Throughput Volume in such Month. A Marine Vessel's cargo will apply to the Month in which loading and unloading is completed, provided that if a cargo is unable to be loaded or unloaded in the Month in which loading or unloading was scheduled due to the failure of Operator to perform as scheduled, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate Month in which to credit receipt of such cargo. The Shortfall Credit shall be credited as follows:

SECTION 28 MISCELLANEOUS
(a) . This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by the Parties; provided, however, that the Operator has the right to modify, supplement, or restate, from time to time, the schedules, exhibits, and Annexes according to the
Modification; Waiver
 
provisions (i) through (ix) below. Any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing at any time by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof. No waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized individual on behalf of the Party against which the waiver is sought to be enforced. No waiver of any term or condition or of any breach of this Agreement will be deemed or will constitute a waiver of any other term or condition or of any later breach (whether or not similar), nor will such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.
(i) Schedule 6 (A) Flat Rate Fees: Shall be annually adjusted by the positive change in CPI-U (if any), as indicated in Section 8(a);
(ii) Schedule 7 (C) List of Anticipated Projects: Operator may modify, supplement, or restate provisions at its discretion;

(iv) Annex B Sections 1.0 through 5.0 and Section 8.0: Operator may not modify, supplement, or restate provisions without obtaining written consent of Customer.
(v) Annex B Section 6.0 Dock Specifications and Section 7.0 Product Specification Limits: Operator reserves the right to modify, supplement, or restate provisions as required to maintain safe and secure operations and to maintain regulatory compliance. Operator shall notify Customer as soon as practicable of any specification changes which become more restrictive for Customer's use of the Berths. In the event that the dock or Product specifications are changed in a manner that becomes more restrictive than the specifications listed on Annex B, Section 6.0 and Section 7.0 at the time of executing this Agreement, the following procedures shall occur:
(1) Operator and Customer shall meet within 30 days of Operator's notice to review the potential financial impact to Customer from restrictions on vessel operations resulting from the change in specification. Customer shall provide detailed explanation of all assumptions and calculations for the analysis. Operator shall provide reasonable explanation of the basis for the change in specifications and its analysis of any modifications to the Berths or operating procedures that might be reasonably implemented to mitigate adverse financial impact to Customer. If the specification changes arise as a result of action or inaction by the Port of Long Beach for its channels and waters, then Section 27 shall apply and the potential financial impact shall be deemed to be zero.
(2) If the financial impact to Customer from restrictions on vessel operations resulting from the change in specifications is agreed to be less than $500,000 per year, Operator will use reasonable commercial efforts to restore capability of the terminal to meet the dock and Product specifications in effect on the Execution Date, to the extent reasonably possible, within a reasonable time period. If the costs associated with such restoration of capability are within the other provisions of this Agreement for OCR and/or MPC, then those provisions shall apply accordingly.
 
(3) If the financial impact to Customer from restrictions on vessel operations resulting from the change in specifications is agreed to be in excess of $500,000 per year, then the Parties shall proceed as follows;
(I) Within 180 days of the specification change, Operator may offer Customer a monthly financial settlement as an adjustment to the MTVF to compensate Customer for the financial impact of the restrictions on vessel operations resulting from the change in specifications. In such notice, Operator shall notify Customer of any changes that Operator intends to make to restore the original specifications, in whole or in part, or to otherwise mitigate the effect of the change in specifications. If Operator is able to make changes in the specifications or operating procedures that mitigate all or part of such financial impact to Customer, then the financial settlement amount shall be adjusted by the mitigated amount. If the costs associated with such restoration of capability are within the other provisions of this Agreement for OCR and/or MPC, then those provisions shall apply accordingly.
(II) Operator shall have the option, but not the obligation, to make modifications and restoration to the terminal to allow the dock and Product specifications to be restored to those in effect on the Execution Date. If the costs associated with such restoration of capability are within the other provisions of this Agreement for OCR and/or MPC, then those provisions shall apply accordingly. Upon restoration of dock or Product specifications to those in effect at the time of execution of this Agreement, then the obligation of Operator to make a monthly financial settlement shall terminate.
(III) If within 270 days of the date of its notice, Operator does not either (i) restore the dock or Product specifications to meet or exceed those in effect on the Execution Date or (ii) agree to make a monthly financial settlement to compensate Customer for the financial impact of restrictions on vessel operations resulting from the change in dock and Product specifications contained in Annex B Section 6.0 and Section 7.0 in effect on the Execution Date, then Customer may terminate this Agreement by providing Operator 60 days written notice.
(IV) So long as Operator is making monthly financial settlements to Customer as provided in (I) above, then the Parties shall meet every 12 months to review the actual on-going financial impact to Customer from restrictions on vessel operations resulting from the change in specification. Operator shall provide reasonable explanation of the status and projected timeline of any modifications to the Berths or operating procedures that might be reasonably implemented to mitigate adverse financial impact to Customer. Customer shall provide detailed explanation of all its actual data and calculations for the analysis. Customer and Operator shall agree on an updated actual financial impact to be used in any subsequent monthly financial settlements. If any financial impact to Customer is agreed to be greater than $500,000 per year, then Operator shall provide Customer with 30 days notice of whether it elects to continue to make a monthly financial settlement adjusted to correspond to the then current financial impact to Customer. If Operator elects to continue making such adjusted financial settlements, this Agreement shall continue, with the financial settlement amounts modified as provided herein. If the financial impact is greater than $500,000 per year, and Operator elects to not continue making such monthly financial settlements, then Customer may terminate this Agreement by providing Operator 60 day's written notice.
 
(V) In the event that Operator and Customer are unable to agree upon the amount of any financial impact to Customer, provided for herein, they shall submit the appropriate data to a mutually agreed third party with expertise in the industry, whose conclusion shall be binding on both parties. The cost of the third party analysis shall be equally split between the Parties.
(vi) Annex B Section 9.0 Miscellaneous: Operator shall not change the Nomination Procedures without consent of Customer. Any change to the Nomination Procedures shall not be done in a manner that discriminates against Customer relative to all other customers, excluding Shell Lubes, using the Berths.
(vii) Annex B-1 Tesoro Marine Vessel Vetting Process: Operator may not modify, supplement, or restate provisions without obtaining written consent of Customer.
(viii) Annexes C and C-1 Security Plan and Access Agreement: Operator may modify, supplement, or restate provisions in its reasonable discretion in order to meet its operational needs or to address safety and security concerns by providing Customer 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any change.
(ix) Annex D Approved Crude Qualities: Operator may not eliminate any specific crude grades listed unless required for compliance with regulation or law. Operator shall use due diligence to review and approve new crudes requested by Customer that are not included in Annex D.

This Agreement, together with the other agreements executed contemporaneously herewith, together with the schedules and annexes, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings of the Parties in connection therewith.
Entire Agreement
(c) .

VETTING POLICY
All vessels must be vetted and accepted before they can be approved to berth at a facility owned or operated by Tesoro.
Vetting is used to determine the suitability and acceptability/non-acceptability of a vessel with the following objectives:
 
 
 
VETTING PROCESS
Vetting is performed by the Tesoro Vetting group utilizing a dedicated vetting program designed and maintained by Marine Information Systems. The program is called Tesoro Assessment & Ship Clearance (TASC), and it is internet based and provides a central process and record of all vetting activity. TASC includes direct links with Lloyd's List Intelligence and Q88.com as well as links with SIRE, USCG PSIX, Equasis, Paris MOU, Tokyo MOU, Indian Ocean MOU and other sites that may be useful in the vetting process. TASC also includes a Terminal/Superintendent feedback capability which is an important element of the vetting process.
Vetting requests must be submitted in TASC by Tesoro personnel.
When a vessel is submitted for a vetting clearance the owner or operator must provide or update the following to the Terminal scheduler (as indicated in Annex B) with carbon copy to :
vetting@tsocorp.com
 
 
 
 
The vetting process includes numerous factors such as those listed below, but may include other considerations as circumstances warrant:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After a detailed review the following may result:
 
 
 
 
A vessel must be vetted each and every time it is considered for use as described in the previous vetting policy section unless the vessel is under time charter to Tesoro.

(a) . Within five (5) days of the end of each Month, TRMC shall provide TLO with a statement of the total volumes of Products shipped on the Segments during the preceding Month, with reasonable supporting documentation to establish the throughput on the Segments during such prior Month. If TRMC determines that any information reflected in such statement is incorrect, then TRMC shall promptly notify TLO accordingly and shall provide supporting information to reflect the correction.
Volumetric Information
(b) . If, during any Month, actual shipments by TRMC on the LAR Short Haul Pipelines are less than the Minimum Throughput Volume, then TRMC shall pay to TLO, in addition to Throughput Fee owed for actual barrels shipped during such Month, an amount equal to (i) the amount of such shortfall (in Barrels) multiplied by (ii) the Throughput Fee (the ""). The dollar amount of any Shortfall Payment included in the monthly invoice described in Section 6(d) below and paid by TRMC shall be posted as a credit to TRMC's account (the ""), and such Credit shall be applied in subsequent monthly invoices against amounts owed by TRMC for Throughput Fees on Excess Barrels shipped on the LAR Short Haul Pipelines during any of the succeeding three (3) Months. Credits will be applied in the order in which such Credits accrue and any portion of the Credit that is not used by TRMC during the succeeding three (3) Months will expire (., a Credit which accrues in January will be available in February, March and April, will expire at the end of April, and must be applied prior to applying any Credit which accrues in February).

(a) The services provided by TLO pursuant to this Agreement shall only consist of the transportation and throughput of Products on the LAR Short Haul Pipelines.
(b) TLO shall have no obligation to measure volume gains or losses of petroleum in the normal course of transportation, and shall have no liability to TRMC for physical losses or degradation of Products, except for losses resulting from negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement by TLO or its employees, agents or contractors. TLO will not provide insurance for TRMC's Products.
 
In order to effectuate the underlying objectives of this Agreement, TLO agrees as follows:
(a) During the Term, each Segment of the LAR Short Haul Pipelines is not operated as a common carrier under California law and is not a public utility, as defined pursuant to FERC regulations. TLO shall not use any Segment to provide services for any third party, except upon specific directions from TRMC.
(b) Subject to Force Majeure, required maintenance and repairs and the other provisions hereunder, TLO shall make each active Segment continuously available to TRMC at all times, and shall ship all volumes of Products nominated by TRMC for shipment in such Segment upon request. Each Segment shall remain exclusively dedicated to shipment of one class of Products (, gasoline or jet fuel), which shall not be changed except by mutual agreement of the Parties. TRMC shall be responsible for providing a pressurized feed sufficient for the movement of Products through each Segment from its origin to its final destination. TRMC shall be responsible for making all arrangements for the scheduling, origin and destination of Products shipped through the Segments, and for ensuring that the receiving facilities are capable of receiving shipments as they are delivered. In the event that TLO must remove a Segment from active service for repair or maintenance, then TLO shall provide TRMC with as much advance notice as possible under the circumstances, and the Parties shall cooperate to minimize the impact of such downtime on operation of the Wilmington Refinery.
i.e.
 
(c) TLO and TRMC shall coordinate and mutually agree on shipment schedules with each other and with connecting pipelines or terminals, and TLO shall not be obligated to make any shipment at any time when a connecting pipeline or terminal is not prepared to deliver or receive it, as applicable, or when doing so would result in an unsafe operating condition, it being understood that TRMC shall be primarily responsible for nominating receipts and deliveries to third party pipeline carriers or terminals.
(d) From time to time, TLO may designate a maximum allowable operating pressure ("") on each Segment, which may be changed by TLO in its sole discretion upon notice to TRMC; provided, however, that if TLO should ever reduce the maximum operating pressure of a Segment such that TLO is no longer capable of maintaining the Minimum Throughput Capacity, then TRMC may exercise its rights and remedies under Section 14(c) below. As of the date hereof, the designated maximum operating pressure on the Jet Fuel Pipeline is 720 PSIG and the Gasoline Diesel Pipeline is 720 PSIG. TRMC shall not deliver any Products into a Segment at a pressure that exceeds or could cause the Segment to exceed its MAOP, and in the event that TRMC determines that an ongoing delivery through a Segment may exceed the MAOP of that Segment, then TRMC shall immediately shut down the delivery and cause the pressure to be reduced. TRMC shall immediately notify TLO at any time that the MAOP of a Segment has been exceeded. TRMC shall conduct all pumping operations in accordance with applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, using adequately trained and qualified personnel. TMRC shall maintain and make available for TLO's inspection recording charts reflecting a true and accurate record of line pressure. Upon request, TRMC shall provide TLO with dynamic volumetric pipeline monitoring or volumetric flow rates and cumulative total volumes of total volumes. In the event that the difference between pipeline monitoring readings or shipper and receiver total volumes exceeds three percent (3%) or becomes greater than two percent (2%) for longer than four (4) hours, TRMC shall shut down the transfer and shall not resume such transfer until the pipeline monitoring reading can be reconciled or the difference between shipper and receiver cumulative totals reconciles to within two percent (2%).
MAOP
(e) TRMC shall be responsible for providing all linefill in the LAR Short Haul Pipelines and for providing all materials for line flushing and pushing products movements through the pipelines to their destination and for any required line flushes. TRMC shall be solely responsible for receiving, handling and disposing of any transmix generated in connection with operation of the LAR Short Haul Pipelines. If TLO requires that products be removed from a pipeline to accommodate any inspections or repairs, then TRMC shall comply with such requests.
(f) In the event TLO is required to file a tariff with the FERC or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the LAR Short Haul Pipelines, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, TLO shall ensure that any such tariffs do not prejudice any of TRMC's rights under the terms of this Agreement.
 
TLO shall be deemed to have custody of the Products being transported through the LAR Short Haul Pipelines to the nominated destination at the time it enters the LAR Short Haul Pipelines and until the time it enters the nominated destination. Upon re-delivery of any Products to TRMC's account, TRMC shall become solely responsible for any loss, damage or injury to Person or property or the environment, arising out of transportation, possession or use of such Products after transfer of custody. Except as provided in Section 7(b), title and risk of loss to all TRMC's Products received at the LAR Short Haul Pipelines shall remain with TRMC at all times. Both Parties acknowledge that this Agreement represents a bailment of Products by TRMC to TLO and not a consignment of same, it being understood that TLO has no authority hereunder to sell or seek purchasers for Products of TRMC. TRMC hereby warrants that it shall have good title to and the right to deliver, Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
 
TRMC acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, TRMC has or acquires no right, title or interest in or to the LAR Short Haul Pipelines, except the right to deliver Products through the Pipelines as set forth herein. TLO shall retain control of the LAR Short Haul Pipelines at all times.
 
(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the shipment of Products on the LAR Short Haul Pipelines is not subject to regulation by the FERC or State of California.
(b) The Parties are entering into this Agreement in reliance upon and shall fully comply with all Applicable Law which directly or indirectly affect the Products to be throughput hereunder, or any receipt, throughput delivery, transportation, handling or storage of Products hereunder. Each Party shall fully comply with all Applicable Law associated with such Party's respective performance hereunder and the maintenance and operation of such Party's facilities. In the event any action or obligation imposed upon a Party under this Agreement shall at any time be in conflict with any requirement of Applicable Law, then this Agreement, shall immediately be modified to conform the action or obligation so adversely affected to the requirements of Applicable Law, and all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain effective.
(c) If during the Term, any new Applicable Law becomes effective or any existing Applicable Law or its interpretation is materially changed, which change is not addressed by another provision of this Agreement and has a material adverse economic impact upon a Party either Party, acting in good faith, shall have the option to request renegotiation of the relevant provisions of this Agreement with respect to future performance. The Parties shall then meet and negotiate in good faith amendments to this Agreement that will conform this Agreement to the new Applicable Law while preserving the Parties' economic, operational, commercial and competitive arrangements in accordance with the understandings set forth herein.
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Party shall be liable or responsible to the other Party or such other Party's affiliated Persons for any consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits or revenues (collectively referred to as "special damages") incurred by such Party or its affiliated Persons that arise out of or relate to this Agreement, regardless of whether any such claim arises under or results from contract, tort, or strict liability; provided that the foregoing limitation is not intended and shall not affect (i) special damages imposed in favor of unaffiliated Persons that are not Parties to this Agreement, and (ii) special damages actually incurred by TLO as a proximate result of TRMC's violation of Section 8(d) except to the extent such violation is the result of acts or omissions of TLO.

At the meeting, the Parties will negotiate in good faith with the objective of reaching a joint resolution for the Restoration of capacity on the affected portion of the LAR Short Haul Pipelines which will, among other things, specify steps to be taken by TLO to fully accomplish Restoration and the deadlines by which the Restoration must be completed (the ""). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Capacity Resolution shall set forth an agreed upon time schedule for the Restoration activities. Such time schedule shall be reasonable under the circumstances, consistent with customary pipeline transportation industry standards and shall take into consideration TLO's economic considerations relating to costs of the repairs and TRMC's requirements concerning the operation of the Wilmington Refinery. In the event that TRMC's economic considerations justify incurring additional costs to restore the LAR Short Haul Pipelines in a more expedited manner than the time schedule determined in accordance with the preceding sentence, TRMC may require TLO to expedite the Restoration to the extent reasonably possible, subject to TRMC's payment, in advance, of the estimated incremental costs to be incurred as a result of the expedited time schedule. In the event the Parties agree to an expedited Restoration plan wherein TRMC agrees to fund a portion of the Restoration cost, then neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13(a) above so long as such Restoration is completed with due diligence, and TRMC shall pay such portion to TLO in advance based on an estimate conforming to reasonable engineering standards applicable to petroleum products pipelines, as applicable. Upon completion, TRMC shall pay the difference between the actual portion of Restoration costs to be paid by TRMC pursuant to this Section 14(c) and the estimated amount paid under the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after receipt of TLO's invoice therefor, or, if appropriate, TLO shall pay TRMC the excess of the estimate paid by TRMC over TLO's actual costs as previously described within thirty (30) days after completion of the Restoration.

TRMC's Right To Cure
 
Resolution in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 14(c) or (iii) fails to perform its obligations in compliance with the terms of a Capacity Resolution, TRMC may, as its sole remedy for any breach by TLO of any of its obligations under Section 14(c), require TLO to complete a Restoration of the affected portions of the LAR Short Haul Pipelines. Any such Restoration required under this Section 14(d) shall be completed by TLO at TRMC's cost. TLO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide transportation of Products tendered by TRMC while such Restoration is being completed. Any work performed by TLO pursuant to this Section shall be performed and completed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable pipeline industry standards and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and/or regulations. Additionally, during such period after the occurrence of (x) a Partnership Change of Control or (y) a sale of the Wilmington Refinery, TRMC may exercise any remedies available to it under this Agreement (other than termination), including the right to immediately seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief for specific performance by TLO of the applicable provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to make Restorations described herein.
 
(a) In the event that TRMC decides to permanently or indefinitely suspend refining operations at the Wilmington Refinery for a period that shall continue for at least twelve (12) consecutive Months, TRMC may provide written notice to TLO of TRMC's intent to terminate this Agreement (the ""). Such Suspension Notice shall be sent at any time after TRMC has publicly announced such suspension and, upon the expiration of the twelve (12) Month period following the date such notice is sent (the ""), this Agreement shall terminate and TRMC shall not be required to approve any third party use of the LAR Short Haul Pipelines. If TRMC publicly announces, more than two (2) Months prior to the expiration of the Notice Period, its intent to resume operations at the Wilmington Refinery, then the Suspension Notice shall be deemed revoked and the applicable portion of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such Suspension Notice had never been delivered.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 
:
Products Pipeline Segments
Gasoline/diesel pipeline from Wilmington Refinery to Shell Carson Terminal and Jet fuel pipeline from Wilmington Refinery to Shell Carson Terminal: 15,000 bpd or 456,250 Barrels/month

Exhibit 99.1
 
Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) and Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) today announced that Tesoro Corporation ("Tesoro") has contributed the Long Beach marine terminal and Los Angeles short-haul pipelines owned by Tesoro's subsidiary, Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company, to Tesoro Logistics LP ("the Partnership") for total consideration of $210 million.
SAN ANTONIO  September 14, 2012
"This transaction marks Tesoro's second sale of assets to the Partnership and represents the first significant addition of third-party volumes into the TLLP system, one of the Partnership's primary business objectives," said Greg Goff, Tesoro Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tesoro Logistics' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are committed to capturing the full value of our logistics assets and growing the Partnership's distributions."
These assets, located near Tesoro's Wilmington, California refinery, consist of a two-vessel berth dock leased from the City of Long Beach, six storage tanks with combined capacity of 235,000 barrels and six related pipelines with 70,000 barrels per day throughput connecting the marine terminal, Tesoro's refinery and other third-party facilities.
The purchase price of $210 million included cash of $189 million and Tesoro Logistics equity valued at approximately $21 million. The cash consideration was financed with borrowings under Tesoro Logistics' recent 5.875% Senior Notes offering. The equity consideration was based on the average daily closing price of common units for the 10 trading days prior to today, or $44.47 per unit, with 98% in the form of common units and 2% in the form of general partner units.
In connection with the closing of the transaction, Tesoro and the Partnership entered into a throughput and use agreement for the marine terminal assets and a transportation services agreement for the short-haul pipeline assets. Both of these agreements include minimum throughput commitments, annual price escalations and ten year initial contract terms. Tesoro Logistics expects that this contribution will result in an estimated $22 million of additional annual EBITDA, approximately half of which is expected to be from third parties.
 
Also today, Tesoro Logistics consummated its previously announced offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2020. The Partnership intends to use the proceeds from the offering to fund its acquisition of Tesoro's Long Beach marine terminal and Los Angeles short-haul pipelines and to repay all of its outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility, with any remaining amounts to be used for working capital and general partnership purposes.
