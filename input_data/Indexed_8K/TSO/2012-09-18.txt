and , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party.

provided
further
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i)
 
above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Notes purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Solely for the purposes of the preceding two sentences, the net proceeds received by the Company shall be deemed also to be indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantors and the information supplied by the Company shall also be deemed to have been supplied by the Guarantors. The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes sold and distributed by it was offered to the purchasers exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that the statements with respect to the offering and stabilization of the Notes set forth in the third paragraph, the third and fourth sentences of the sixth paragraph, the seventh paragraph, the ninth paragraph and the eleventh paragraph in the "Underwriting" section of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase
9. Default by One or More of the Underwriters
 
under this Agreement (the ""), the remaining Underwriters shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other Underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth: if, however, the Underwriters shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
Defaulted Securities
(a) if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased hereunder, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective purchase obligations hereunder with respect to the Notes bear to the purchase obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters with respect to the Notes; , that no non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated by this provision to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of Notes that it agreed to purchase pursuant to the terms of Section 2, or
provided
however,
(b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 9.
. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by them by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market or in the over-the-counter market, or trading in any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, shall have been suspended or the settlement of such trading generally shall have been materially disrupted or minimum prices shall have been established on any such exchange or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or state authorities of the United States, (iii) since the date of this Agreement, the United States shall have become engaged in hostilities, there shall have been a significant escalation in hostilities involving the United States or there shall have been a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred such a material adverse change in general domestic or international economic, political or financial conditions, including without limitation as a result of terrorist activities after the date hereof, or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States or shall be such, as to make it in the case of (iii) or (iv), in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
10. Termination
 
. If the sale of Notes provided for herein is not consummated because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantors shall reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel and for such other out-of-pocket expenses as shall have been incurred by them in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Notes, and upon demand the Company and the Guarantors shall pay the full amount thereof to the Underwriters. If this Agreement is terminated by any party hereto for any other reason, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to reimburse the Underwriters for, or otherwise be responsible for, any fees or expenses of the Underwriters, including fees and expenses of the Underwriters' counsel.

% Senior Notes due 2015 (CUSIP/ISIN No. 881609AS0/US881609AS06) (the "2015 Notes") and 6

2
% Senior Notes due 2017 (CUSIP/ISIN No. 881609AT8/US881609AT88) (the "2017 Notes" and together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes"). The terms of the Offers are as set forth below.
The Offers are for any and all of Tesoro's outstanding 2015 Notes and outstanding 2017 Notes, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Tesoro's Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated September 13, 2012 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Statement"), and in the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time and, collectively with the Statement, the "Offer Documents"). In connection with the Offers, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, Tesoro is soliciting consents (with respect to each series of Notes, a "Consent Solicitation" and collectively, the "Consent Solicitations") of holders of each series of Notes to authorize the elimination of most of the restrictive covenants and certain of the events of default contained in the indenture pursuant to which such series of Notes were issued (the "Proposed Amendments"). Holders may not tender their Notes without delivering their consents to the applicable Proposed Amendments and may not deliver consents to the Proposed Amendments without tendering their related Notes. Tesoro is seeking consents to the Proposed Amendments with respect to each series of Notes as a single proposal in each case.
The early tender deadline with respect to each series of Notes is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 26, 2012 (such time and date, as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes, the "Early Tender Deadline"), and the Offer with respect to each series of Notes will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on October 11, 2012 (such time and date, as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes, the "Expiration Time"), in each case, unless
extended or earlier terminated by Tesoro. Notes tendered may be withdrawn at any time at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 26, 2012 (such time and date, as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes, the "Withdrawal Deadline") but not thereafter, except as required by law. Tesoro may extend the Early Tender Deadline with respect to a series of Notes without extending the related Withdrawal Deadline.
The table below summarizes certain payment terms of the Offers and the Consent Solicitations:
 
 
Holders validly tendering Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be eligible to receive the Total Consideration, listed in the table above, with respect to the applicable series of Notes tendered, which includes an early tender payment equal to $30.00 per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes (the "Early Tender Payment").
