The 2017 Notes were issued at an issue price of 100.000% and bear interest at a rate of 4.250% per annum. Interest on the 2017 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2013. The 2017 Notes will mature on October 1, 2017.
At any time and from time to time prior to September 1, 2017, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2017 Notes at a "make whole" redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may also redeem some or all of the 2017 Notes on or after September 1, 2017 for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. If the Company sells certain assets or experiences specific kinds of change of control and a ratings downgrade, it may be required to offer to purchase the 2017 Notes.
The 2022 Notes were issued at an issue price of 100.000% and bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum. Interest on the 2022 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2013. The 2022 Notes will mature on October 1, 2022.

If the Company sells certain assets or experiences specific kinds of change of control and a ratings downgrade, it may be required to offer to purchase the 2022 Notes.
The Notes are the Company's general unsecured senior obligations, and are effectively subordinate to all of the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, structurally subordinate to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries, equal in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of the Company's future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries.
The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-183872), which became automatically effective upon filing on September 13, 2012 (the "Registration Statement").

Supplemental Indentures Relating to Existing Notes
Pursuant to the Company's previously announced cash tender offers, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 26, 2012 (the "Early Tender Deadline"), $236,880,000 principal amount of the Company's 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") had been tendered and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 52.64% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 2015 Notes, and $294,619,000 principal amount of the Company's 6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Existing 2017 Notes" and, together with the 2015 Notes, the "Existing Notes") had been tendered and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 62.26% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Existing 2017 Notes. Holders of Existing Notes who tendered their Existing Notes also delivered consents to certain proposed amendments to such series of Existing Notes and the related indenture (the "Proposed Amendments").
On September 26, 2012, the Company and the Trustee executed supplemental indentures to the indentures governing the Existing Notes (the "Supplemental Indentures") that effected the Proposed Amendments by eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in such indentures and certain events of default and related provisions. The Supplemental Indentures became operative upon acceptance of and payment for the tendered Existing Notes by the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement and the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent dated September 13, 2012.
On September 27, 2012, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $558 million in order to purchase the Existing Notes tendered prior to the Early Tender Deadline.
As discussed under Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company has called the remaining Existing Notes for redemption and has satisfied and discharged its obligations under the remaining Existing Notes and the indentures governing the remaining Existing Notes as of September 27, 2012.
The foregoing description of the Supplemental Indentures does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Supplemental Indentures, which are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, herewith and incorporated by reference herein.
A copy of the press release announcing the expiration of the Early Tender Deadline, receipt of the required consents for the Supplemental Indentures, exercise of the early purchase option and satisfaction and discharge of the remaining Existing Notes is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The information set forth above under Item 1.01 above is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
 
Redemption of Existing Notes and Discharge of Indentures Governing Existing Notes
On September 27, 2012, the Company requested that the Trustee, on behalf of the Company, provide notice of redemption to the holders of the Existing Notes that remained outstanding after the Company purchased all of the Existing Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior the Early Tender Deadline pursuant to the cash tender offers. On such date, the Company deposited with the Trustee sufficient funds to redeem the remaining outstanding Existing Notes and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. As a result, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Existing Notes and the related indentures pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of such indentures. Redemption of the remaining outstanding Existing Notes will occur on November 1, 2012.
A copy of the press release announcing the expiration of the Early Tender Deadline, receipt of the required consents for the Supplemental Indentures, exercise of the early purchase option and satisfaction and discharge of the remaining Existing Notes is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

% Senior Notes due 2017 (CUSIP/ISIN Numbers 881609AT8/US881609AT88) (the "2017 Notes" and, collectively with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes").
In addition, Tesoro today exercised the early purchase option and accepted for purchase all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline. Holders who validly tendered their Notes and delivered their consents at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and who did not validly withdraw their Notes prior to the withdrawal deadline received the total consideration equal to, (i) with respect to the 2015 Notes, $1,017.50 per $1,000 principal amount of 2015 Notes, and (ii) with respect to the 2017 Notes, $1,035.00 per $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes, which includes, in each case, an early tender payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Such holders also received accrued and unpaid interest in respect of their purchased Notes from the last interest payment date to, but not including, September 27, 2012.
As of the Early Tender Deadline, $236,880,000 principal amount of the 2015 Notes had been tendered and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 52.64% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 2015 Notes, and $294,619,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes had been tendered and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 62.26% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 2017 Notes.
The Company also announced today that it had received consents from holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes outstanding to adopt the proposed amendments to the indenture governing such series of Notes. The Company entered into a supplemental indenture effecting the proposed amendments with respect to each series of Notes, each of which became operative upon payment for the applicable series of Notes.
In addition, the Company announced today that it has called for redemption all remaining outstanding Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable indenture. As a result of depositing with the trustee sufficient funds to pay principal, premium
and accrued and unpaid interest on each series of Notes to, but not including, the redemption date, the Company has been released from its obligations under the Notes and the related indentures. The trustee will complete the redemption of the remaining outstanding Notes on November 1, 2012.
The Offer with respect to each series of Notes will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on October 11, 2012 (such time and date, as it may be extended with respect to a series of Notes, the "Expiration Time"), in each case, unless earlier extended or terminated by the Company. Holders who have not already tendered their Notes may do so at any time at or prior to the Expiration Time. If their Notes are accepted for purchase at or prior to the Expiration Time but after the Early Tender Deadline, such holders will only be eligible to receive the tender offer consideration equal to (i) in the case of the 2015 Notes, $987.50 per $1,000 principal amount of 2015 Notes, or (ii) in the case of the 2017 Notes, $1,005.00 per $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the applicable payment date.
The Company is conducting the Offers and consent solicitations in accordance with the terms and conditions described in its Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement (the "Statement") and the related Letter of Transmittal and Consent (together with the Statement, the "Offer Documents") dated September 13, 2012.
