Exhibit 99.1
Tesoro Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
SAN ANTONIO - October 31, 2012
- Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported third quarter 2012 net income of $273 million, or $1.92 per diluted share compared to net income of $345 million, or $2.39 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2011.
The 2012 results include one-time after-tax expenses totaling $0.13 per diluted share related primarily to the redemption of $1.2 billion of Senior Notes during the quarter. Excluding these items, the Company earned $292 million, or $2.05 per diluted share.
Other items impacting third quarter results include crude oil delivery disruptions and maintenance activities in the California region and incentive-based compensation accrual increases totaling a combined $65 million in pre-tax earnings.
Our solid operating performance and high refinery utilization allowed us to capture attractive market conditions, said Greg Goff, President and CEO. We made significant progress on our high-return capital program, executed our second asset sale to TLLP and announced the transformational acquisition of BP's Southern California refining and marketing business.
1
For the quarter, the Company recorded segment operating income of $628 million, compared to segment operating income of $622 million in the third quarter of 2011. The strong operating income performance was driven by operational reliability, favorable market conditions and discounted crude oil relative to industry benchmarks.
The third quarter Tesoro Index of $16.65 per barrel (/bbl) was up $3.30/bbl from a year ago. Higher year-over-year West Coast benchmark gasoline crack spreads, which were up over 90% in California and nearly 50% in the Pacific Northwest, positively impacted the Tesoro Index in the quarter. West Coast benchmark distillate crack spreads were also higher year-over-year, up over 40% in both California and the Pacific Northwest. The Company's realized gross margin was $18.32/bbl.
Driving the Company's gross margin performance in excess of the Tesoro Index was discounted crude oil compared to benchmark grades of crude oil. On the West Coast, foreign heavy and Canadian light sweet crude oil continued to price at a discount to domestic alternatives. In the mid-continent region, crude oil priced off of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) continued to trade at a discount to Brent. Crude oil delivery disruptions and maintenance activity in California negatively impacted pre-tax earnings by an estimated $40 million during the quarter. Total throughput in the quarter was 626 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) or 93% utilization.
Direct manufacturing costs in the third quarter averaged $4.42/bbl, down $0.41/bbl relative to the second quarter of this year, benefiting from higher refinery utilization and continued low energy costs.
2
Retail fuel sales volumes were up 18% year-over-year driven by the addition of 174 retail stations from Thrifty Oil Co. in the second and third quarters of this year and the 49 Albertson's Fuel Express retail stations acquired in the first quarter of this year. The additional ratable volumes were a result of the Company's strategic focus on refining and marketing integration. Same store fuel sales during the quarter were lower by about 1% on a year-over-year basis, while retail fuel margins were up relative to last year.
Corporate and unallocated costs, net of $9 million of corporate depreciation and excluding $64 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense associated with variable share-based awards, were $49 million in the third quarter. This exceeds prior guidance of $39 million due primarily to costs associated with the BP transaction and a $25 million incentive-based compensation accrual made during the quarter, $6 million of which was included in corporate and unallocated.
Value-Driven Growth
Tesoro made significant progress on its large capital refinery projects during the third quarter. In September of this year, the Company began delivering advantaged Bakken crude oil to the Anacortes, Washington refinery via the recently completed unit train unloading facility, with permitted capacity of 50 mbpd. After receiving all required permits in September, the Company broke ground on the Salt Lake City Conversion Project, which will allow the refinery to run over 20 mbpd of price advantaged waxy crude oil, increase throughput capacity by 4 mbpd and improve clean product yields, with the first phase expected to come on-line in 2013. Finally, the installation of the new vacuum distillation unit at the Wilmington, California refinery is nearing completion, with operations expected to begin in November of this year, driving significant product yield improvements.

Tesoro reaffirmed its intention to offer the Anacortes, Washington unit train unloading facility to TLLP. The unloading facility, which became operational in September of this year, should generate an expected annual logistics EBITDA in the $15 to $20 million range. Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter 2012 and include corresponding throughput and minimum volume commitment agreements.
On August 13, 2012, Tesoro announced its intentions to purchase BP's integrated Southern California refining and marketing business. The purchase price of BP's assets is $1,175 million, plus the value of inventory at the time of closing, which at current prices is valued at approximately $1,300 million. The combination with Tesoro's current West Coast system is expected to drive significant operational synergies through the integrated supply of crude oil, enhanced optimization of intermediate feedstocks and product distribution costs, improvements in light product yield and reductions in manufacturing costs and stationary source air emissions. The combined and reconfigured operations are expected to drive annual synergies of approximately $250 million with an additional net capital investment of approximately $225 million. The transaction, with expected earnings accretion of about 24% in each of the first and second years of operations, is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close before mid-2013.
Finally, on September 14, 2012, Tesoro sold the Long Beach marine terminal and Los Angeles short-haul pipelines owned by Tesoro's subsidiary, Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company, to Tesoro Logistics LP. The sales price of $210 million included cash of $189 million and Tesoro Logistics equity valued at approximately $21 million.

Capital Spending and Liquidity
Capital spending for the third quarter was $133 million. Turnaround spending was $11 million. The Company currently anticipates capital spending in 2012 to be approximately $590 million, down $80 million from prior guidance. Expectations for full year 2012 turnaround spending remain at $260 million. The Company ended the third quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and remained undrawn with greater than $775 million of availability on the Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility. Tesoro Logistics LP ended the quarter undrawn on its separate credit facility.
On September 14, 2012, Tesoro Logistics LP issued $350 million 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020, TLLP's first ever senior debt issuance. Proceeds from the offering were used to fund the acquisition of Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company's Long Beach Marine terminal and Los Angeles short-haul pipelines and to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under TLLP's revolving credit facility.
On September 24, 2012, Tesoro Corporation announced the redemption of all of its outstanding $299 million 6.250% Senior Notes due November 2012.
On September 27, 2012, Tesoro Corporation issued $450 million 4.250% Senior Notes due 2017 and $475 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022. Net proceeds from that offering, along with cash on hand, was used to fund its cash tender offers and redemption of all of its outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes due 2015 and 6.500% Senior Notes due 2017. The redemption of the 2012 notes and the refinancing of the 2015 and prior 2017 notes reduces interest expense, extends maturities and further strengthens Tesoro's balance sheet.
5
The strong quarterly performance and resulting financial strength, allowed us to continue to delever the balance sheet with the redemption of the 2012 senior notes and take advantage of attractive debt markets with the refinancing of $925 million in senior notes, resulting in a quarter end total debt to total capitalization ratio of 25%, said Goff.
Finally, On October 5, 2012, TLLP closed a public offering of 4,255,000 common units at an offering price of $41.80 per unit, which included a 555,000 unit over-allotment option that was exercised by the underwriters. Net proceeds to TLLP from the sale of the units were approximately $171 million. Subsequent to the TLLP equity issuance, Tesoro Corporation and its affiliates owned an approximate 47% interest in TLLP, including an approximate 2% general partner interest.
Dividend
Tesoro Corporation today announced that the board of directors has approved a 25% increase in the Company's regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.15 per share, effective with the quarterly dividend payable on December 14, 2012 to holders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2012.
