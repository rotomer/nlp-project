Effective November 15, 2012, Tesoro Corporation ("the Company" or "Tesoro") entered into a transaction (the "Sale") with Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company ("TRMC"), Tesoro Logistics LP (the "Partnership"), Tesoro Logistics GP LLC (the "General Partner") and Tesoro Logistics Operations LLC (the "Operating Company") pursuant to which TRMC sold, through the General Partner and the Partnership to the Operating Company, the Anacortes rail facility assets (the "Anacortes Rail Facility") located in Anacortes, Washington.
The Sale was made in exchange for consideration of $180 million, comprised of $162 million in cash and the issuance of equity with a combined fair value of $18 million. The equity is comprised of 93,289 general partner units and 309,838 common units, representing slightly less than a 1% limited partner interest in the Partnership.
The Anacortes Rail Facility includes a four-track unloading platform, two receiving and departing tracks capable of handling a 100-car unit train and two additional short track spurs, as well as other related assets and properties associated with the facility. The facility, which was placed in service in September 2012, has a permitted capacity to deliver up to 50,000 barrels per day ("bpd") of Bakken crude oil to the Company's Washington refinery.
The Company issued a press release on November 15, 2012, announcing the Sale, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
In connection with the Sale, the Company entered into the following material definitive agreements:
Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement
The description of the Contribution Agreement (as defined below) is provided below under Item 2.01 and is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference. A copy of the Contribution Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Second Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement
Effective November 15, 2012, in connection with the Sale, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (the "Second Amended Omnibus Agreement") with the Partnership, the General Partner, TRMC, Tesoro Alaska Company ("Tesoro Alaska") and Tesoro Companies, Inc. ("TCI") that amends and restates the amended and restated agreement those parties entered into on April 1, 2012. The Second Amended Omnibus Agreement added the following matters to the amended and restated agreement:
So long as we control the General Partner, the Second Amended Omnibus Agreement will remain in full force and effect unless mutually terminated by the parties. If we cease to control the General Partner, either party may terminate the Second Amended Omnibus Agreement, provided that the indemnification obligations of the Parties made under the Omnibus Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Amended Omnibus Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Anacortes Track Use and Throughput Agreement
Effective November 15, 2012, in connection with the Sale, TRMC entered into a track use and throughput agreement (the "TTA") with the Operating Company under which the Operating Company will provide TRMC with use of the Anacortes track and offloading facility as well as the service of offloading crude or other agreed products from unit trains and manifest railcars. Under the TTA, TRMC is obligated to transport an average of at least 40,000 bpd of crude oil and refined products per month offloaded and throughput at the Anacortes Rail Facility at a throughput fee of $1.53 per barrel. An excess volume throughput fee of $0.75 per barrel is charged for monthly volumes in excess of 40,000 bpd.
 
If TRMC fails to transport aggregate volumes equal to its minimum throughput commitment described above during any calendar month, TRMC will owe the Operating Company a shortfall payment equal to the volume of the shortfall multiplied by the throughput fee. The amount of any shortfall payment paid by TRMC will be credited against any amounts owed by TRMC for the transportation of volumes in excess of its minimum throughput commitment during any of the succeeding three months after the shortfall occurs.
The fees under the TTA are indexed for inflation. The initial term of the TTA is ten years and TRMC, at its sole option, may extend the term for two renewal terms of five years each.
The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the TTA, which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Relationships
Each of the Partnership, the General Partner, TRMC, Tesoro Alaska, TCI, the Operating Company and THPP is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Tesoro. As a result, certain individuals, including officers and directors of Tesoro and the General Partner, serve as officers and/or directors of more than one of such other entities. After the Sale, the General Partner, as the general partner of the Partnership, holds 729,596 general partner units of the Partnership, which represents a 2% general partner interest and 979,025 common units of the Partnership, which represents an approximate 3% limited partner interest in the Partnership.

, then not later than six months after the consummation of the acquisition or the completion of construction by such Tesoro Entity of the Subject Assets, as the case may be, the Tesoro Entity shall notify the General Partner in writing of such acquisition or construction and offer the Partnership Group the opportunity to purchase such Subject Assets in accordance with this
Section 2.3
(the 
Offer
). The Offer shall set forth the terms relating to the purchase of the Subject Assets and, if any Tesoro Entity desires to utilize the Subject Assets, the Offer will also include the terms on which the Partnership Group will provide services to the Tesoro Entity to enable the Tesoro Entity to utilize the Subject Assets. As soon as practicable, but in any event within 60 days after receipt of the Offer, the General Partner shall notify the Tesoro Entity in writing that either (i) the General Partner has elected not to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, in which event the Tesoro Entity shall be forever free to continue to own or operate such Subject Assets, or (ii) the General Partner has elected to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, in which event the procedures outlined in the remainder of this
Section 2.3
shall apply.
(b)
    
If the Tesoro Entity and the General Partner are able to agree on the fair market value of the Subject Assets that are subject to the Offer and the other terms of the Offer including, without limitation, the terms, if any, on which the Partnership Group will provide services to the Tesoro Entity to enable the Tesoro Entity to utilize the Subject Assets, within 60 days after receipt by the General Partner of the Offer, a Partnership Group Member shall purchase the Subject Assets for the agreed upon fair market value as soon as commercially practicable after such agreement has been reached and, if applicable, enter into an agreement with the Tesoro Entity to provide services in a manner consistent with the Offer.
(c)
    
If the Tesoro Entity and the General Partner are unable to agree on the fair market value of the Subject Assets that are subject to the Offer or the other terms of the Offer including, if applicable, the terms on which the Partnership Group will provide services to the Tesoro Entity to enable the Tesoro Entity to utilize the Subject Assets, within 60 days after receipt by the General Partner of the Offer, the Tesoro Entity and the General Partner will engage a mutually agreed upon, nationally recognized investment banking firm to determine the fair market value of the Subject Assets and any other terms on which the Partnership Group and the Tesoro Entity are unable to agree. The investment banking firm will determine the fair market value of the Subject Assets and any other terms on which the Partnership Group and the
Tesoro Entity are unable to agree within 30 days of its engagement and furnish the Tesoro Entity and the General Partner its determination. The fees of the investment banking firm will be split equally between the Tesoro Entity and the Partnership Group. Once the investment banking firm has submitted its determination of the fair market value of the Subject Assets and any other terms on which the Partnership Group and the Tesoro Entity are unable to agree, the General Partner will have the right, but not the obligation to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets pursuant to the Offer, as modified by the determination of the investment banking firm. If the General Partner elects to cause a Partnership Group Member to purchase the Subject Assets, then the Partnership Group Member shall purchase the Subject Assets under the terms of the Offer, as modified by the determination of the investment banking firm as soon as commercially practicable after such determination and, if applicable, enter into an agreement with the Tesoro Entity to provide services in a manner consistent with the Offer, as modified by the determination of the investment banking firm.

(b)
    
At the end of each calendar year, the Partnership will have the right to submit to Tesoro a proposal to reduce the amount of the Administrative Fee for that year if the Partnership believes, in good faith, that the centralized corporate services performed by Tesoro and its Affiliates for the benefit of the Partnership Group for the year in question do not justify payment of the full Administrative Fee for that year. If the Partnership submits such a proposal to Tesoro, Tesoro agrees that it will negotiate in good faith with the Partnership to determine if the Administrative Fee for that year should be reduced and, if so, the amount of such reduction. If the Parties agree that the Administrative Fee for that year should be reduced, then Tesoro shall promptly pay to the Partnership the amount of any reduction for that year.

The site is considered characterized and is currently undergoing groundwater monitoring and treatment. Off-site groundwater investigations are scheduled for 2012.
3. Stockton Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline and diesel releases from pipelines and/or product storage tanks. The site is considered substantially characterized and is undergoing groundwater treatment and groundwater monitoring. Off-site groundwater impacts are commingled with neighboring petroleum storage terminals.
4. Burley Terminal groundwater was impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoros purchase of the facility. Groundwater impacts were commingled with neighboring petroleum storage terminals. Hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater samples do not exceed previously established target levels for groundwater and surface water protection. Regulatory closure is pending.
5. Wilmington Sales Terminal soil and groundwater have been impacted by gasoline releases occurring prior to Tesoros purchase of the facility. Groundwater investigation and monitoring is on-going. Tesoro is indemnified by the previous owner for Investigation and remediation obligations.

(a)    
Offload and Throughput Fees
. TRMC agrees to pay to TLO the following fees for all Barrels of Product offloaded and throughput at Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility:
(i)    A Minimum Throughput Volume Fee (the 
MTVF
) of $1,861,501 per Month (which is $1.53/Barrel multiplied by the Minimum Throughput Volume), subject to escalation as provided in
Section 8
below;
plus
(ii)    a $0.75 per Barrel offloading and throughput fee for Product volumes in excess of the Minimum Throughput Volume (
Excess Throughput Volume Fee
), subject to escalation as provided in
Section 8
below.
(b)     
MTVF Relief
. During any Month that the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility is unavailable to receive any of TRMCs unit trains on a day in which such unit train is scheduled to have access to the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility, for any reason other than TRMCs actions, including without limitation, TLOs actions, Force Majeure, and the actions of a Governmental Authority, and such unavailability prevents TRMC from offloading and throughputting, then the Minimum Throughput Volume and the MTVF for such Month will be reduced in proportion to the number of days in such Month when TRMCs unit trains were prevented from having access to the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility as a result of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility being unavailable, divided by the total days in such Month; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction to the Minimum Throughput Volume and MTVF shall not exceed the actual reduction in volume of, and offload and throughput fees charged for, such Product handled by TLO.
(c)    
Offset for Deemed Credit Amount
. During any Month where (i) TRMC does not schedule any railcars for the use of, or otherwise fails to offload and throughput Product at, the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility, and/or (ii) TRMC has temporarily or permanently suspended operations at the Anacortes Refinery, such that in either or both cases, the number of railcars to be offloaded and throughput during such Month would be zero (0), then TRMC shall be credited $70,000 per month (the 
Deemed Credit Amount
), and the Deemed Credit Amount shall be offset against the MTVF for such Month.
During any Month under the Term of this Agreement, TRMC may request that the Services include receipt of manifest railcars, in addition to, or in lieu of, unit train railcars nominated by TRMC for offload and throughput at the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility; provided that all nominations made by TRMC are made in accordance with
Annex B
, including without limitation, providing sufficient advance notice. For purposes of this Agreement, a 
manifest railcar
 means any single unit railcar in a shipment of Product to the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility for which BNSF would owe payment to TLO under Section 1.3 of the ITA. Upon receipt of such request, TLO may consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to accept such manifest railcars proposal by TRMC. TLO shall not be required to consent to any requests that would require Services to be performed that are not authorized under existing agreements with BNSF or other third party contractors, provided that TLO shall make commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate suitable arrangements with such contractors to authorize such Services. TLO shall also not be required to consent to any proposal that would require new, expanded or modified facilities and equipment. Fees for any and all Product volumes received at the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility via manifest railcars shall be at the same per barrel rate specified in Section 5(a)(i) above for the Minimum Throughput Volume (as escalated from time to time pursuant to
Section 8
), plus any applicable
6
surcharge to reimburse TLO for any incremental costs or expenses incurred by TLO in connection with the offload and throughput of such manifest railcars and volumes. Any and all Product volumes received during a Month at the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility via manifest railcars shall be credited against TRMCs Minimum Throughput Volume for such Month.
(a)    TRMC shall reimburse TLO for, or TLO shall be permitted to charge TRMC an additional per Barrel surcharge for any and all of the following:
(i)
    
The actual cost of any capital expenditures that TLO agrees to make upon TRMCs written request;
(ii)
    
The costs that TLO incurs in complying with any new Applicable Laws that affect the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility or
services provided by TLO to TRMC hereunder;
provided
, that (A) compliance by TLO with any such new law or regulation requires substantial unanticipated capital expenditures by TLO, (B) TLO has made good faith efforts to mitigate the effect of any such law or regulation and (C) TLO has negotiated in good faith with TRMC in order to agree on the level of any such surcharge;
(iii)
    
All taxes (other than ad valorem taxes, property taxes, income taxes, gross receipt taxes, payroll taxes and similar taxes) that TLO specifically incurs on TRMCs behalf for the services TLO provides to TRMC hereunder, if such reimbursement is not prohibited by law;
(iv)
    
Subject to
Sections 14(d)
and
18(b)
, any demurrage assessed by BNSF or under Applicable Law and paid directly by TLO;
(v)
    
All costs incurred in connection with (1) any laboratory tests or specific railcar sampling requested by TRMC under
Section 10
, and (2) the detention and storage of railcars, pursuant to
Section 13 (d)
;
(vi)
    
The actual cost of any surcharges incurred by TLO in connection with the offload of and throughput from manifest railcars pursuant to Section 6 above; and
(vii)
    
All incremental costs or surcharges incurred by TLO from third party contractors in connection with the unloading of and throughput from any unit train that is not comprised of the full complement of one (100) hundred railcars; provided that such incremental costs or surcharges may only be assessed when, in a given Month, TRMC nominates (A) three or more unit trains with less than ninety (90) railcars in each such unit train, or (B) one or more unit trains with less than eighty (80) railcars in each such unit train.
(b)
    
If TRMC objects to the level of any surcharge under items (i) through (iii) above, then TLO shall impose a surcharge for those expenditures as it deems, in its sole discretion, to be mandatory. The period of time over which such charges are recovered shall be determined by TLO in light of the remaining period in the Term of this Agreement and the projected future deliveries of Product to the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility. In such case, if TLO determines that all or some costs to which TRMC has objected could be reduced or mitigated by changes in operation of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility, including taking a portion of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility out of service, reducing the capacity of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility, or restricting use of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility, then TRMC may request that TLO do so, rather than imposing a surcharge to
7
maintain service at a particular level, and in that event, TLO shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate such request;
provided
that TLO shall not be required to take any actions that it believes in good faith might result in a violation of any operating requirement and such reduction in capacity shall not be a Force Majeure event or other basis for any reduction in TRMCs Minimum Throughput Volume or for a reduction in any fees except surcharges avoided by such reduction in capacity.
Starting July 1, 2013, all fees in
Section 5(a)
and the Deemed Credit Amount in
Section 5(c)
above shall automatically be increased on the first day of July for each year of the Term,
by a percentage equal to the greater of zero or the positive change in the CPI-U for the prior calendar year, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent.
(a)    
Monthly Shortfall Credit
. If, during any Month, the actual volume of Barrels offloaded and throughput by TRMC are less than the Minimum Throughput Volume, then TRMC shall nevertheless pay to TLO the MTVF. Upon Payment of the MTVF, TRMC shall receive a 
Shortfall Credit
 calculated as the difference between the Minimum Throughput Volume less the actual total volumes received during such month, multiplied by the sum of the MTVF, on a per Barrel basis.
(b)     
Monthly Reconciliation
. Actual volumes of Barrels offloaded and throughput at the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility are to be determined Monthly, based upon receipts during the Month (as measured by custody transfer meter) and credited towards the Minimum Throughput Volume in such Month; provided, however, that during the start-up period of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility and until custody transfer metering becomes fully operational, TLO will utilize TRMCs loading ticket receipts to measure throughput and TLO will reconcile to actual railcars received at the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility during that Month. The Shortfall Credit shall be credited as follows:
(i)    the dollar amount of any Shortfall Credit included in the Monthly invoice will be posted as a credit to TRMCs account and may be applied against amounts owed by TRMC for throughput volumes in excess of the Minimum Throughput Volume during any of the succeeding three (3) Months; and
(ii)     any portion of the Shortfall Credit that is not used by TRMC during the succeeding three (3) Months will expire at the end of said three (3) Month period relating to the respective credit and be reset to zero.
(c)    
Fees & Costs Calculation
. At the end of each Month, TLO will calculate the total fees and costs that TRMC incurred for offloading and throughput of Barrels at the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility during such Month, as follows:
(i)    the MTVF;
plus
(ii)     the Excess Throughput Volume Fees attributable to such Month;
less
(iii)    any applicable Shortfall Credits to TRMC, but not to exceed the Excess Throughput Volume Fees for such Month;
less
(iv)    the Deemed Credit Amount, if applicable;
plus
8
(v)    any surcharges, reimbursements or pass-through costs for such Month pursuant to
Section 7
.
(d)    
Invoices
. TLO will invoice TRMC Monthly, providing its calculations of all applicable items set forth above. All amounts set forth above shall be due and payable no later than ten (10) days after TRMCs receipt of TLOs invoice. The invoiced amount shall be for the items described above and other charges during the prior Month. Any past due payments owed by either Party shall accrue interest, payable on demand, at the lesser of (i) the rate of interest announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase Bank, in New York, New York, as JPMorgan Chase Banks prime rate (which Parties acknowledge and agree is announced by such bank and used by the Parties for reference purposes only and may not represent the lowest or best rate available to any of the customers of such bank or the Parties),
plus
four percent (4%), and (ii) the highest rate of interest (if any) permitted by Applicable Law, from the due date of the payment through the actual date of payment.
(e)    
Disputed Amounts
. If TRMC reasonably disputes any amount invoiced by TLO, TRMC shall pay the amount of the invoice when due and provide TLO with written notice stating the nature of the dispute prior to ninety (90) days after the due date of the invoice. TRMC and TLO shall use reasonable commercial diligence to resolve disputes in good faith and in a timely manner. All portions of the disputed amount determined to be owed TRMC shall be refunded to the TRMC within ten (10) days of the dispute resolution.  
(i)    
Product Testing/Quality Analysis
. Upon request and at the sole expense of TRMC (such expense to be negotiated at the time of such request and to include applicable labor and fees), TLO shall provide TRMC a laboratory report for each Product delivery by TRMC or TRMCs supplier. TLO will not be obligated to receive Off-Spec Product for offload and throughput at the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility, nor will TLO be obligated to accept Product that fails to meet the quality specifications set forth in any arrival notice. Further, TLO will not perform any Product quality analysis on behalf of TRMC unless TRMC so requests in writing. Any such quality analyses, including any costs for independent inspectors appointed by TRMC, are for TRMCs account. TRMC or its designated independent inspector may observe TLO in any measurement or sampling.
(ii)    
Off-Spec Product
. TRMC at its sole cost and expense shall be responsible for all damages of any kind, in addition to commodity or Waste removal and cleaning costs resulting from the introduction of Off-Spec Product into the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility.

(b)    Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, TRMC shall release, defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless TLO and each of its respective affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees, successors-in-interest and assignees (each individually, a

(d)    
THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSLY NEGOTIATED IN EVERY DETAIL, ARE INTENDED TO BE GIVEN FULL AND LITERAL EFFECT, AND SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES OR DAMAGES IN QUESTION ARISE OR AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND CONSTITUTES CONSPICUOUS NOTICE. NOTICE IN THIS CONSPICUOUS NOTICE IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SPECIFIED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.
OF FIRST REFUSAL
(a)    Termination for Default. A Party shall be in default under this Agreement if:
(i)    the Party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within fifteen (15) Business Days after notice thereof (which notice shall describe such breach in reasonable detail) is received by such Party; or
(ii)    the Party (A) files a petition or otherwise commences, authorizes or acquiesces in the commencement of a proceeding or cause of action under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Applicable Law, or has any such petition filed or commenced against it, (B) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors, (C) otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced) or (D) has a liquidator, administrator, receiver, trustee, conservator or similar official appointed with respect to it or any substantial portion of its property or assets.
If either Party is in default as described above, then the non-defaulting Party may: (1) terminate this Agreement upon notice to the defaulting Party; (2) withhold any payments due to the defaulting Party under this Agreement; and/or (3) pursue any other remedy at law or in equity.
(c)    
Right to Enter New Agreement
. Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than (x) a default by TRMC, (y) any termination of this Agreement initiated by TRMC pursuant to
15
Section 21
, or (z) a termination by reason of TRMCs failure to exercise a renewal term option under
Section 4
, TRMC shall have the right to require TLO to enter into a track use and throughput agreement with TRMC that (i) is consistent with the terms set forth in this Agreement, (ii) relates to the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility that are the subject matter of this Agreement, and (iii) has commercial terms that are, in the aggregate, equal to or more favorable to TLO than fair market value terms as would be agreed by similarly-situated parties negotiating at arms length; provided, however, that the term of any such new track use and throughput agreement shall not extend beyond April 30, 2032.
(d)    
Right of First Refusal
. In the event that TLO proposes to enter into a track use and throughput agreement with a third party upon the termination of this Agreement for reasons other than (x) by default by TRMC, (y) any termination of this Agreement initiated by TRMC pursuant to
Section 21
, or (z) a termination by reason of TRMCs failure to exercise a renewal term option under
Section 4
, TLO shall give TRMC ninety (90) days prior written notice of any proposed new track use and throughput agreement with a third party, including (i) details of all of the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii) a thirty (30)-day period (beginning upon TRMCs receipt of such written notice) (the 
TTA First Offer Period
) in which TRMC may make a good faith offer to enter into a new track use and throughput agreement with TLO (the 
TTA Right of First Refusal
).  If TRMC makes an offer on terms no less favorable to TLO than the third-party offer with respect to such track use and throughput agreement during the TTA First Offer Period, then TLO shall be obligated to enter into a track use and throughput agreement with TRMC on the terms set forth in subsection (c) above. If TRMC does not exercise its TTA Right of First Refusal in the manner set forth above, TLO may, for the next ninety (90) days, proceed with the negotiation of the third-party track use and throughput agreement. If no third-party track use and throughput agreement is consummated during such ninety-day period, the terms and conditions of this
Section 20(e)
shall again become effective. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 20(e)
to the contrary, TRMCs TTA Right of First Refusal shall only be available and exercisable for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days after termination of this Agreement for reasons other than (x) by default by TRMC, (y) any other termination of this Agreement initiated by TRMC pursuant to
Section 21
, or (z) a termination by reason of TRMCs failure to exercise a renewal term option under
Section 4
.
(a)    As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure, TLO shall provide TRMC with written notice of the occurrence of such Force Majeure (a 
Force Majeure Notice
). TLO shall identify in such Force Majeure Notice the approximate length of time that TLO reasonably believes in good faith such Force Majeure shall continue (the 
Force Majeure Period
). If TLO is unable to perform or is delayed in performing, in whole or in part, its obligations hereunder as a result of such Force Majeure, then TLOs obligations shall be suspended during, but no longer than, the continuance of such Force Majeure event. If TLO advises in any Force Majeure Notice that it reasonably believes in good faith that the Force Majeure Period shall continue for more than twelve (12) consecutive Months, then at any time after TLO delivers such Force Majeure Notice, either Party may terminate this Agreement, but only upon delivery to the other Party of a notice (a 
Termination Notice
) at least twelve (12) Months prior to the expiration of the Force Majeure Period;
provided
,
however
; that such Termination Notice shall be deemed cancelled and of no effect if the Force Majeure Period ends prior to the expiration of such twelve-Month period.
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if TRMC delivers a Termination Notice to TLO (the 
TRMC Termination Notice
) and, within thirty (30) days after receiving such TRMC Termination Notice, TLO notifies TRMC that TLO reasonably believes in good faith that it shall be capable of fully performing its obligations under this Agreement within a reasonable period of time, then the TRMC
16
Termination Notice shall be deemed revoked and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such TRMC Termination Notice had never been given.
(a)    TRMC is not permitted to suspend or reduce its obligations under this Agreement in connection with a shutdown of the Anacortes Refinery for scheduled turnarounds or other regular servicing or maintenance. If refining operations at the Anacortes Refinery are suspended for any reason (including Anacortes Refinery turnarounds and other scheduled maintenance), then TRMC shall remain liable for the MTFV and any reimbursements or surcharges under this Agreement for the duration of the suspension. TRMC shall provide at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any suspension of operations at the Refinery due to a planned turnaround or scheduled maintenance.
(b)     Further, in the event that TRMC decides to permanently or indefinitely suspend refining operations for any reason at the Anacortes Refinery, TRMC shall still remain liable for the MTVF and any reimbursements or surcharges under this Agreement for the duration of the suspension or the remaining Term, whichever is longer; provided, however, that TLO shall make commercially reasonable efforts to develop third party use of some or all of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility, and any net proceeds received from such development, net of costs (including without limitation any amortized capital costs for conversion of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility or the installation of new connections) shall be credited towards TRMCs Minimum Throughout Volume obligations.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
(a)    On the Commencement Date, the General Partner shall assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the Partnership. The Partnership shall immediately assign its rights and obligations hereunder to TLO. Upon such assignment to TLO, TLO shall have all of the respective rights and obligations set forth herein during the Term of this Agreement.
(b)    Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 23
, TRMC shall not assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without TLOs prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided
,
however
, that TRMC may assign this Agreement without TLOs consent in connection with a sale by TRMC of the Anacortes Refinery so long as the transferee: (i) agrees to assume all of TRMCs obligations under this Agreement and (ii) is financially and operationally capable of fulfilling the terms of this Agreement, which determination shall be made by TRMC in its reasonable judgment.
(c)    TLO shall not assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without TRMCs prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided
,
however
, that (i) subject to
Section 23(d)
below, TLO may assign this Agreement without TRMCs consent in connection with a sale by TLO of all or substantially all of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility so long as the transferee: (A) agrees to assume all of TLOs obligations under this Agreement; (B) is financially and operationally capable of fulfilling the terms of this Agreement, which determination shall be made by TLO in its reasonable judgment; and (C) is not a competitor of TRMC; and (ii) TLO shall be permitted to make a collateral assignment of this Agreement solely to secure working capital financing for TLO.
(
d)    Any assignment that is not undertaken in accordance with the provisions set forth above shall be null and void
ab initio
. A Party making any assignment shall promptly notify the other Party of such
17
assignment, regardless of whether consent is required. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
(e)
    
In the event that at any time during the Term hereof, as it may be extended under
Section 4
, TLO proposes to sell of all or substantially all of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility
to a third party, TLO shall give TRMC ninety (90) days prior written notice of any such sale, including (i) details of all of the material terms and conditions thereof, including without limitation, a firm commitment by a capable third party purchaser to purchase all or substantially all of the the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility at specified price, and (ii) a sixty (60)-day period (beginning upon TRMCs receipt of such written notice) (the 
Purchase First Offer Period
) in which TRMC may make a good faith offer to purchase all or substantially all of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility from TLO (the 
Purchase Right of First Refusal
).  If TRMC makes an offer on terms no less favorable to TLO than the third-party offer with respect to such sale during the Purchase First Offer Period, then TLO shall be obligated to sell all or substantially all of the Rail Unloading Facility to TRMC on the same terms set forth in such offer to purchase by the third party. If TRMC does not exercise its Purchase Right of First Refusal in the manner set forth above, TLO may, for the next ninety (90) days, proceed with the negotiation of the sale of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility. If such sale is not consummated during such ninety (90) period, the terms and conditions of this
Section 23(e)
shall again become effective.
(f)
    
TRMCs obligations hereunder shall not terminate in connection with a Partnership Change of Control, provided, however, that in the case of any Partnership Change of Control or the sale of all or substantially all of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility
to a purchaser other than TRMC, TRMC shall retain the option to extend the Term of this Agreement as provided in
Section 4
, and the Identification Date (as defined in the Omnibus Agreement) shall be deemed to have occurred, if it has not already occurred by reason of the passage of time. TLO shall provide TRMC with notice of any Partnership Change of Control at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date thereof.
(a)    At all times during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after termination of this Agreement for any coverage maintained on a claims-made or occurrence basis, each Party shall maintain at its expense the below listed insurance in the amounts specified below which are minimum requirements. Such insurance shall provide coverage to each Party, as applicable, and such policies, other than Workers Compensation Insurance, shall include each Party as an Additional Insured, as applicable.

Section 27
. Each Party further agrees to take the same care with the other Partys Confidential Information as it does with its own, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Excepted from these obligations of confidence and non-use is that information which:
(i)    is available, or becomes available, to the general public without fault of the receiving Party;
(ii)    was in the possession of the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to receipt of the same from the disclosing Party;
(iii)    is obtained by the receiving Party without an obligation of confidence from a third party who is rightfully in possession of such information and, to the receiving Partys knowledge, is under no obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; or
(iv)    is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to or use of the disclosing Partys Confidential Information.
For the purpose of this
Section 27
, a specific item of Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by, or underlies, more general information in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving Party.
20
(b)    
Required Disclosure
. Notwithstanding
Section 27(a)
above, if the receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose the Confidential Information by a court, Governmental Authority or Applicable Law, or is required to disclose by the listing standards of any applicable securities exchange, any of the disclosing Partys Confidential Information, the receiving Party shall promptly advise the disclosing Party of such requirement to disclose Confidential Information as soon as the receiving Party becomes aware that such a requirement to disclose might become effective, in order that, where possible, the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or such other remedy as the disclosing Party may consider appropriate in the circumstances. The receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the disclosing Partys Confidential Information that it is required to disclose and shall cooperate with the disclosing Party in allowing the disclosing Party to obtain such protective order or other relief.
(c)    
Return of Information
. Upon written request by the disclosing Party, all of the disclosing Partys Confidential Information in whatever form shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed with destruction certified by the receiving Party upon termination of this Agreement, without the receiving Party retaining copies thereof except that one copy of all such Confidential Information may be retained by a Partys legal department solely to the extent that such Party is required to keep a copy of such Confidential Information pursuant to Applicable Law, and the receiving Party shall be entitled to retain any Confidential Information and accounting information in the electronic form or stored on automatic computer back-up archiving systems during the period such backup or archived materials are retained under such Partys customary procedures and policies;
provided
,
however
, that any Confidential Information retained by the receiving Party shall be maintained subject to confidentiality pursuant to the terms of this
Section 27
, and such archived or back-up Confidential Information shall not be accessed except as required by Applicable Law.
(d)    
Receiving Party Personnel
. The receiving Party will limit access to the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party to those of its employees, attorneys and contractors that have a need to know such information in order for the receiving Party to exercise or perform its rights and obligations under this Agreement (the 
Receiving Party Personnel
). The Receiving Party Personnel who have access to any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party will be made aware of the confidentiality provision of this Agreement, and will be required to abide by the terms thereof. Any third party contractors that are given access to Confidential Information of a disclosing Party pursuant to the terms hereof shall be required to sign a written agreement pursuant to which such Receiving Party Personnel agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, which written agreement will expressly state that it is enforceable against such Receiving Party Personnel by the disclosing Party.
(e)    
Survival
. The obligation of confidentiality under this
Section 27
shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.
(a)    
Modification; Waiver
. This Agreement may be terminated, amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by the Parties. Any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing at any time by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof. No waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any breach thereof, will be effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized individual on behalf of the Party against which the waiver is sought to be enforced. No waiver of any term or condition or of any breach of this Agreement will be deemed or will constitute a waiver of any other term or condition or of any later breach (whether or not similar), nor will such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.
21
(b)    
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings of the Parties in connection therewith.
(c)    
Governing Law; Jurisdiction
. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court of competent jurisdiction situated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division, or if such federal court declines to exercise or does not have jurisdiction, in the district court of Bexar County, Texas. The Parties expressly and irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of said Courts and irrevocably waive any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought in such Courts, irrevocably waive any claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and further irrevocably waive the right to object, with respect to such claim, action, suit or proceeding brought in any such Court, that such Court does not have jurisdiction over such Party. The Parties hereby irrevocably consent to the service of process by registered mail, postage prepaid, or by personal service within or without the State of Texas. Nothing contained herein shall affect the right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.
(d)    
Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf)) for the convenience of the Parties hereto, each of which counterparts will be deemed an original, but all of which counterparts together will constitute one and the same agreement.
(e)    
Severability
. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance will be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision hereof, and the Parties will negotiate in good faith with a view to substitute for such provision a suitable and equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.
(f)    
No Third Party Beneficiaries
. It is expressly understood that the provisions of this Agreement do not impart enforceable rights in anyone who is not a Party or successor or permitted assignee of a Party.
(g)    
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
. EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PERFORMANCE OR FAILURE TO PERFORM OF ANY OBLIGATION HEREUNDER.

Tesoro Corporation Closes the Sale of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility to Tesoro Logistics
SAN ANTONIO - November 15, 2012 -
Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) and Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) today announced that Tesoro Corporation (Tesoro) closed the sale of the Anacortes Rail Unloading Facility owned by Tesoro's subsidiary, Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company, to Tesoro Logistics LP (the Partnership) for total consideration of $180 million.
The sale of the Anacortes rail facility marks Tesoro's third sale of assets to the Partnership, said Greg Goff, Tesoro's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tesoro Logistics' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This transaction highlights the ability of Tesoro to leverage TLLP in the growth and development of its logistics business, allowing us to broaden our capability to deliver price advantaged crude oil within the Tesoro refining system, while also increasing cash distributions to the Partnership's unitholders.
The facility, located near Tesoro's Anacortes, Washington refinery, consists of a four track offloading station capable of unloading 100 car unit trains and has a permitted capacity of 50,000 barrels per day.
The purchase price of $180 million included cash of $162 million and Tesoro Logistics equity valued at approximately $18 million. The cash consideration was financed from available cash. The equity consideration was based on the average daily closing price of common units for the 10 trading days prior to today, or $44.65 per unit, with 77% in the form of common units and 23% in the form of general partner units.
In connection with the closing of the transaction, Tesoro and the Partnership entered into a throughput and use agreement for the rail unloading facility assets. This agreement includes a minimum throughput commitment of 40 mbpd, annual price escalations and ten year initial contract terms. Tesoro Logistics expects that this contribution will result in an estimated $19 million of additional annual logistics EBITDA.
