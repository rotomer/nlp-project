These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding TSYS' expected growth in net income for the year 2002, expected conversions and processing of new accounts and the assumptions underlying such statements, including, with respect to TSYS' expected increase in net income; TSYS' expected internal growth rate for existing portfolios; an aggressive focus on expense control and productivity improvement; the successful implementation and market acceptance of new product offerings; expected increases in the number of accounts on file; expected increases in revenues; and expected increases in revenues attributable to international clients.

A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS' ability to control or predict. The factors include, but are not limited to, lower than anticipated internal growth rates for TSYS' existing customers; TSYS' inability to control expenses and increase market share; TSYS' inability to successfully bring new products to market, including, but not limited to, stored value and e-commerce products; the inability of TSYS to grow its business through acquisitions; adverse developments with respect to entering into contracts with new clients and retaining current clients; TSYS' inability to increase the revenues derived from international sources; the merger of TSYS clients with entities that are not TSYS clients or the sale of portfolios by TSYS clients to entities that are not TSYS clients; TSYS' inability to anticipate and respond to technological changes, particularly with respect to e-commerce; adverse developments with respect to the successful conversion of clients; the absence of significant changes in foreign exchange spreads between the United States and the countries TSYS transacts business in, to include Mexico, United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and the European Union; adverse developments with respect to the credit card industry in general; TSYS' inability to successfully manage any impact from slowing economic conditions or consumer spending; --more--
