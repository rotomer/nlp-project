TSYS News Release For Immediate Release Contacts: James B. Lipham Leo S. Berard Chief Financial Officer TSYS Investor Relations +1.706.649.2262 +1.706.649.5220 leoberard@tsys.com TSYS Reports 12.1% Increase in Net Income for 2003 Total revenues surpass $1 billion for the first time Columbus, Ga., Jan. 20, 2004-- TSYS(R)today announced that its financial results are in line with the Company's forecast for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2003. Highlights of the fourth quarter and year, as compared to the same periods in 2002, are as follows: The double-digit growth in revenues and earnings is attributable to these factors: * Revenues from international clients increased 36.9% for the year, primarily due to conversions of new clients in Canada and Europe. * TSYS began a new relationship with Bank One, the world's largest issuer of Visa accounts. * Revenues from value-added services grew 22.1% in 2003. * Accounts on file for the year increased 11.4%. * Peak-season cardholder transaction volumes increased 17.5% over 2002. * Revenues from other services increased 55% for the quarter and 13.6% for the year, primarily due to the acquisition of ESC Loyalty and a new debt-collection services arrangement by TSYS Debt Management. "TSYS met its expectations for 2003, achieving our 20th straight year of earnings growth," said Philip W. Tomlinson, chief executive officer of TSYS. "I am proud of the hard-working and dedicated people in the TSYS family who made us one of the best companies to work for in America for another year. We reached milestones with important new clients and in revenues, controlled expenses and improved on the technologies and products that are changing the marketplace for electronic payments." -- more -- Exhibit 99.1 TSYS Reports 12.1% Increase in Net Income for 2003/Page 2 of 10 The impact of certain events in 2003 will persist in 2004: portfolio sales by multiple clients, continued issuer consolidation and pricing concessions for some large clients of TSYS and Vital Processing Services. In addition, the Company will continue to build and improve its infrastructure to support future domestic and international growth. Based on these factors, TSYS expects its revenues before reimbursables for the year to grow 11-13% over 2003, and expects earnings per share to grow 5-7% for the year. Based on discussions with executive management after the recent merger announcement regarding J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One, TSYS expects to complete the conversion of Bank One's card portfolio to the TS2 platform in the second half of 2004, according to schedule. "We remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for growth that lie ahead," Tomlinson said. The company is developing opportunities to extend processing services in Europe, the Asia-Pacific and United States. TSYS also anticipates growing revenue contributions from the continuing roll-out of TSYS ProphIT, a new web-enabled workflow management system, and affiliate companies like TSYS Debt Management and ESC Loyalty. The Company anticipates 10-15% growth in earnings per share in 2005 based on the following assumptions: 1. Revenue before reimbursable items will increase 10-12%, driven by 6-9% growth in revenue from existing core-processing clients. 2. Vital Processing Services grows earnings by at least 5%. 3. No significant client losses occur through 2005. "We are focused intently on managing the growth of our fundamental operations with discipline, pursuing new clients and a diversification strategy of new products and potential acquisitions. We are working to create momentum for healthier growth in 2005 and beyond," Tomlinson said. "I am confident that we are investing in the opportunities that will position TSYS for sustained, long-term growth."

Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, revenues that are lower than anticipated; internal growth rates for TSYS' existing customers are lower than anticipated; Vital's earnings are lower than anticipated; adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates; adverse developments with respect to entering into contracts with new clients and retaining current clients; the merger of TSYS clients with entities that are not TSYS clients or the sale of portfolios by TSYS clients to entities that are not TSYS clients; larger than anticipated pricing concessions; the potential impact of TSYS' proposal to Citibank for the long-term retention of the acquired Sears portfolio and the expansion of TSYS' private-label processing business; TSYS is unable to control expenses and increase market share; hostilities increase in the Middle East or elsewhere; adverse developments with respect to the credit card industry in general; TSYS is unable to successfully manage any impact from slowing economic conditions or consumer spending; adverse developments with respect to sub-prime or retail clients; and overall market conditions. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. -- more --
