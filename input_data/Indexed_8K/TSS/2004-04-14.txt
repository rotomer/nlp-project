TSYS Reports Results For First Quarter 2004/Page 2 of 9 "The results for the first quarter were slightly better than our expectations," said Philip W. Tomlinson, chief executive officer of TSYS. "However, with the issues surrounding industry consolidation still unresolved, we maintain our original guidance for earnings per share to grow 5-7% for the year." TSYS continues to have ongoing discussions with Bank of America regarding the Fleet merger and with Citigroup regarding its Sears portfolio acquisition. In addition, TSYS' plans and efforts to convert the Bank One portfolio remain fully staffed and on schedule, and TSYS has begun discussions with J.P. Morgan Chase regarding the processing needs of its card portfolio. "We remain optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are developing relationships to extend processing services in Europe, the Asia-Pacific Rim and the United States. TSYS is a global provider of advanced technology solutions that increase value for the clients we serve. We are committed to position TSYS for sustained, long-term growth," Tomlinson said. "We remain bullish on our prospects and anticipate 10-15% growth in earnings per share in 2005." Conference Call TSYS will host its quarterly conference call at 4:30 p.m. EDT, April 14, 2004.
