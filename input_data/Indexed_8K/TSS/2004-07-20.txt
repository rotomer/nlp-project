Below is a summary of the results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003: Highlights for the quarter include: * J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. selected TSYS to provide credit card processing for the merged card portfolios of the former Bank One Corp. and JPMorgan Chase. Upon the completion of all conversions, TSYS will provide processing services for the 87 million cardmembers of Chase Card Services. Both companies expect to reach a definitive agreement in the near future. * Vital continued to exhibit strong transaction growth for the second quarter of 2004. Vital's Internet transaction volumes increased over 70% for 2004 as compared to last year. * Revenues from international clients increased 9.9% for the first six months of 2004 and were impacted by the loss of processing revenues from Mexico during the fourth quarter of 2003. During the second quarter of 2004, TSYS converted the portfolio of the Bank of Ireland. * Revenues from other services increased 62.4% for the quarter, primarily due to the results of TSYS Debt Management and to new services, such as TSYS ProphIT(R). -- more --
