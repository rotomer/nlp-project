NOW, THEREFORE, in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, Director hereby agrees to the following terms and conditions: 1. Transfer of Shares; Custody of Restricted Shares ------------------------------------------------ The Corporation hereby transfers the Restricted Shares to Director subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement.

The Restricted Shares will be held in an account for Director at Mellon, who will hold the shares in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement. 2. Restriction Against Transfer ---------------------------- Neither the Restricted Shares nor any interest in the Restricted Shares may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated or otherwise be disposed of or encumbered except at the time(s) and under the circumstances specifically permitted or required by this Agreement including, but not limited to, any pledge of the Restricted Shares. In the event of any attempt to effect any action in contravention of the next preceding sentence, then, any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, such Restricted Shares shall thereupon be forfeited to the Corporation. 3.

4. Vesting of Restricted Shares ---------------------------- (a) Vesting Conditions. If Director continues to serve on the Board of Directors of the Corporation through the date(s) indicated in Column I below, the Restricted Shares will become non-forfeitable (i.e., "vest") to the extent indicated in Column II below: (I) (II) If service the % of the Restricted continues through then Shares which vests is ----------------- ----------------------- ____________, 200__ 100% Such vesting will occur (to the extent indicated in Column (II) above) at the close of business on the applicable date(s) indicated in Column (I) above.

Effect of Forfeiture -------------------- Any Restricted Shares which are forfeited to the Corporation pursuant to any provision of this Agreement will be surrendered and such shares will thereupon be canceled.
