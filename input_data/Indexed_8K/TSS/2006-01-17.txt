Exhibit 10.2
 
 
THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made effective as of _____________________, 200__, by and between TOTAL SYSTEM SERVICES, INC., a Georgia corporation (the "Corporation"), and ______________________________ ("Executive").
 
WHEREAS, Executive has been awarded _______ fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation, par value $0.10 per share ("Restricted Shares"), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Corporation's 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") and this Agreement; and
 
WHEREAS, the Restricted Shares will be held in an account at Mellon Investor Services, LLC ("Mellon") for Executive until the shares become transferable and non-forfeitable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, Executive hereby agrees to the following terms and conditions:
 
 
The Corporation hereby transfers the Restricted Shares to Executive subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement. Effective upon the date of such transfer, Executive will be the holder of record of the Restricted Shares and will have all rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares (including the right to vote such shares at any meeting at which the holders of the Corporation's Common Stock may vote, the right to receive all dividends declared and paid upon such shares and the right to exercise any rights or warrants issued in respect of any such shares), subject only to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement. The Restricted Shares will be held in an account for Executive at Mellon, who will hold the shares in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement.
 
 
Neither the Restricted Shares nor any interest in the Restricted Shares may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated or otherwise be disposed of or encumbered except at the time(s) and under the circumstances specifically permitted or required by this Agreement including, but not limited to, any pledge of the Restricted Shares. In the event of any attempt to effect any action in contravention of the next preceding sentence, then, any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, such Restricted Shares shall thereupon be forfeited to the Corporation.
 
 
Any Restricted Shares which do not vest pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 below will be forfeited to the Corporation unless the Corporation's Compensation Committee in its sole discretion determines otherwise, as more fully provided in Section 4 below.
 
 
1
 
 
 
 
(a)
Vesting Conditions
. If Executive remains in the continuous employ of the Corporation or a Subsidiary of Synovus Financial Corp. or the Corporation through the date(s) indicated in Column I below, the Restricted Shares will become non-forfeitable (i.e., "vest") to the extent indicated in Column II below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Such vesting will occur (to the extent indicated in Column (II) above) at the close of business on the applicable date(s) indicated in Column (I) above. Any Restricted Shares which are not vested on the date of Executive's termination of employment will be forfeited to the Corporation, unless the Compensation Committee in its sole and exclusive discretion determines otherwise.
 
(b)
Effect of Voluntary Termination or Termination for Cause or Suicide
. If Executive's employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries is terminated: (i) by Executive voluntarily or (ii) by the Corporation or a Subsidiary for Cause or (iii) by Executive's death due to suicide before all Restricted Shares vest pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 4(a) above, then any Restricted Shares which are not vested at the time of such termination will be forfeited to the Corporation on the date of such termination, unless the Compensation Committee in its sole and exclusive discretion determines otherwise.
 
 
2
 
 
 
(c)
Effect of Death (Other Than by Suicide) or Disability
. If Executive's employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries terminates by reason of Executive's death (other than by suicide) or Disability, then any Restricted Shares which are not vested at the time of such termination will become vested automatically.
 
(d)
Effect of Retirement or Leave of Absence
. If Executive's employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries is terminated by reason of Executive's Retirement, Executive will receive the Restricted Shares that are vested on the date of Executive's Retirement. Any Restricted Shares which are not vested on the date of Executive's Retirement will be forfeited to the Corporation, unless the Compensation Committee in its sole and exclusive discretion determines otherwise. A leave of absence which is approved in writing by the Compensation Committee with specific reference to this Agreement will not be considered a termination of Executive's employment with the Corporation and its subsidiaries for purposes of this Section 4 or any other provision of this Agreement.
 
(e)
No Forfeiture of Vested Shares
. Any Restricted Share which vests pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 4 will not thereafter be forfeited. As soon as practicable after any Restricted Shares vest pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 4, Mellon will transfer or deliver such shares to Executive free of any restrictions imposed pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, but not necessarily free of restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws.
 
 
Any Restricted Shares which are forfeited to the Corporation pursuant to any provision of this Agreement will be surrendered and such shares will thereupon be canceled. All of Executive's rights and interests in and to such shares (including the purchase price, if any, paid for such shares) will terminate upon such forfeiture without any payment of consideration by the Corporation, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.
 
 
(a)
Administration, Interpretation and Construction
. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement will be administered, interpreted and construed by the Compensation Committee, whose decisions will be final, conclusive and binding on the Corporation, on Executive and on anyone claiming under or through the Corporation or Executive. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any determination as to whether an event has occurred or failed to occur which causes the Restricted Shares to be forfeited pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, will be made in the good faith but absolute discretion of the Compensation Committee. By accepting the transfer of Restricted Shares, Executive irrevocably consents and agrees to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to all actions, decisions and determinations to be taken or made by the Compensation Committee in good faith pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
 
(b)
Withholding
. The Corporation will have the right to withhold from any payments to be made to Executive (whether under this Agreement or otherwise) any taxes the Corporation determines it is required to withhold with respect to Executive under the laws and regulations of any governmental authority, whether Federal, state or local and whether domestic or foreign, in
 
3
 
 
connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, taxes in connection with the transfer of Restricted Shares or the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Shares. Failure to submit any such withholding taxes shall be deemed to cause otherwise lapsed restrictions on Restricted Shares not to lapse.
 
(c)
Rights Not Assignable or Transferable
. No rights under this Agreement will be assignable or transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, either voluntarily, or, to the full extent permitted by law, involuntarily, by way of encumbrance, pledge, attachment, levy or charge of any nature except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Executive's rights under this Agreement will be exercisable during Executive's lifetime only by Executive or by Executive's guardian or legal representative.
 
(d)
Terms and Conditions Binding
. The terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Corporation, its successors and assigns, including any assignee of the Corporation and any successor to the Corporation by merger, consolidation or otherwise, and Executive, Executive's heirs, devisees and legal representatives. In addition, the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Mellon and its successors and assigns.
 
(e)
No Employment Rights
. No provision of this Agreement or the Plan will be deemed to confer upon Executive any right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or a Subsidiary or will in any way affect the right of the Corporation or a Subsidiary to dismiss or otherwise terminate Executive's employment at any time for any reason with or without cause, or will be construed to impose upon the Corporation or a Subsidiary any liability for any forfeiture of Restricted Shares which may result under this Agreement if Executive's employment is so terminated.
 
(f)
No Liability for Good Faith Business Acts or Omissions
. Executive recognizes and agrees that the Compensation Committee, the Board, or the officers, agents or employees of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, in their oversight or conduct of the business and affairs of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, may in good faith cause the Corporation or a Subsidiary to act, or to omit to act, in a manner that may, directly or indirectly, prevent the Restricted Shares from vesting. No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted or construed to impose any liability upon the Corporation, a Subsidiary, the Compensation Committee, Board or any officer, agent or employee of the Corporation or a Subsidiary, for any forfeiture of Restricted Shares that may result, directly or indirectly, from any such action or omission.
 
(g)
Recapitalization
. In the event that Executive receives, with respect to Restricted Shares, any securities or other property (other than cash dividends) as a result of any stock dividend or split, spin-off, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or a similar corporate change, any such securities or other property received by Executive will likewise be held by Mellon and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and will be included in the term "Restricted Shares."
 
(h)
Appointment of Agent
. By accepting the transfer of Restricted Shares, Executive irrevocably nominates, constitutes, and appoints Mellon as Executive's agent for purposes of surrendering or transferring the Restricted Shares to the Corporation upon any forfeiture required or
 
4
 
 
authorized by this Agreement. This power is intended as a power coupled with an interest and will survive Executive's death. In addition, it is intended as a durable power and will survive Executive's disability.
 
(i)
Legal Representative
. In the event of Executive's death or a judicial determination of Executive's incompetence, reference in this Agreement to Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to Executive's heirs or devises.
 
(j)
Titles

The provisions of the Plan are incorporated herein by this reference, and all capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the same meanings given to such terms in the Plan. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement will be administered, interpreted and construed in accordance with the Plan, and any such term or condition which cannot be so administered, interpreted or construed will to that extent be disregarded.

TSYS Reports 29% Increase in Net Income for 2005
Record Revenue and Earnings Results
 
Columbus, Ga., January 17, 2006
TSYS today announced record annual results with revenues of $1.6 billion and fourth quarter results that exceeded the Company's forecast.
 
"We are excited that we exceeded our expectations for the year, even after raising our forecast twice during 2005," says Philip W. Tomlinson, chief executive officer of TSYS. "The financial strength for the year was driven by the conversion of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., stronger than expected earnings growth at Vital Processing Services, good growth in our value-added products and effective cross-selling of products and services. Our revenue and earnings growth for 2005 were accomplished by the hard work and dedication of our entire team. We are looking forward to another record year in 2006," said Philip W. Tomlinson, chief executive officer of TSYS.
 
Full year 2005 Financial Highlights
 
Below is a summary of the results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same periods in 2004:

Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 2005
 
 
"TSYS posted one of the strongest financial performances in its history in 2005, a year that included several milestone achievements. Unfortunately, the exceptional results have been somewhat overshadowed by news that Citigroup Sears and Bank of America intend to deconvert their consumer accounts in 2006. We believe our management team is deep with experience and has an exceptional support team that is unparalleled in our industry. This team will enable us to continue our momentum in 2006, and overcome any challenge facing us," Tomlinson says.
 
"Our fundamentals continue to be strong, with more than 75 million accounts in the pipeline for conversion in 2006," Tomlinson says. "TSYS delivers real competitive advantages in a dynamic marketplace driven by transaction growth and evolving point-of-sale technologies. We expect that our business will continue to grow domestically and abroad as we extend services to and generate revenue from new markets," said Tomlinson.
TSYS expects its 2006 earnings will increase in the range of 21% - 23%, and is based on the following assumptions:
The expected results for 2006 also include the estimated impact of expensing the fair value of stock options beginning in 2006, as well as expenses associated with restricted stock awards, which are expected to replace stock options as TSYS' primary method of equity-based compensation. The incremental (as compared to 2005) after-tax expense for both options and restricted stock awards in 2006 is estimated at $5.8 million, which represents approximately $0.03 per diluted share, or 3% of reported 2005 diluted earnings per share.
In other business, the TSYS Board of Directors has elected Philip W. Tomlinson as chairman, to succeed Richard W. Ussery, who will continue to serve as a director.

This press release contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding TSYS' expectation that it will deconvert Citigroup's Sears and Bank of America's consumer accounts in 2006; TSYS expectation that business will continue to grow domestically and abroad; the expected after-tax expense for both options and restricted stock awards in 2006; TSYS' expected earnings growth for 2006; and the assumptions underlying such statements, including, with respect to TSYS' expected increase in earnings for 2006, an increase in revenues of 5% to 7%, accounts on file at the end of 2006 will be approximately 395 million to 405 million, deconversion of the Citigroup Sears portfolio as scheduled in May 2006, deconversion of Bank of America's consumer portfolio in October 2006 with a one-time termination payment of $69 million and an acceleration of amortization of approximately $7 million in contract-acquisition costs and TSYS will defer revenues and costs associated with converting and servicing the Capital One portfolio. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, revenues that are lower than anticipated; Bank of America does not deconvert as anticipated and amortization of related contract acquisition costs is not accelerated as anticipated; accounts on file at the end of 2006 are lower than anticipated; TSYS incurs expenses associated with the signing of a significant client; internal growth rates for TSYS' existing clients are lower than anticipated; TSYS does not convert and deconvert clients' portfolios as scheduled; adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates; adverse developments with respect to entering into contracts with new clients and retaining current clients; the merger of TSYS clients with entities that are not TSYS clients or the sale of portfolios by TSYS clients to entities that are not TSYS clients; TSYS is unable to control expenses and increase market share; adverse developments with respect to the credit card industry in general; TSYS is unable to successfully manage any impact from slowing economic conditions or consumer spending; the impact of

acquisitions, including their being more difficult to integrate than anticipated; the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments relating thereto; the impact of the application of and/or changes in accounting principles; overall market conditions; no material breach of the security of any of our systems; and the impact on TSYS' business, as well as on the risks set forth above, of various domestic or international military or terrorist activities or conflicts. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
