Notice of Claims
          (b) . If a Synovus Indemnitee or a TSYS Indemnitee (as applicable) (an "Indemnitee") shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action against it (collectively, a "Third Party Claim") with respect to which a party hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party") may be obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 1.2 or 1.3, such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof within twenty-one (21) calendar days after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim.

Third Party Claims
 
notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, including the amount of the Liability claimed as then-known or reasonably estimated, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed by such Indemnitee or arises.

After timely notice in writing from the Indemnifying Party (which notice shall specify any reservations or exceptions) to the Indemnitee of such election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof. The Indemnitee agrees to cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense against any Third Party Claim.

Defense By Indemnifying Party
          (d) If an Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within twenty-one (21) calendar days after receipt of notice of such claim or if the Indemnifying Party does not have the right to assume the defense of such claim because the claim seeks injunctive relief, declaratory judgment or other nonmonetary relief or otherwise against the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee has provided written notice to that effect to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee will, upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party, have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account of the Indemnifying Party subject to the limitations as set forth in this Section 1.4; , , that no Third Party Claim shall be compromised or settled without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitee assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, it shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse all such costs and expenses of the Indemnitee in the event it is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim.

Additional Matters
          (a) .

The Party that is not responsible for managing the defense of such Third Party Claims shall, upon reasonable request, be consulted with respect to significant matters relating thereto and may retain counsel to monitor or assist in the defense of such claims at its own cost.
Cooperation in Defense and Settlement
          (b) . In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or the Indemnifying Party shall so request, the Parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the rights and obligations of the Parties regarding indemnification and the management of the defense of claims as set forth in this Article I shall not be altered.
Substitution
          (c) . In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of any Indemnitee in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee, in whole or in part based upon whether the Indemnifying Party has paid all or only part of the Indemnitee's Liability, as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or against any other person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
Subrogation
          (d) . Nothing in Section 1.5(a) requires TSYS, Synovus or any of their respective Group members (each acting reasonably) to allow another Party to have access to anything that (i) is the subject of any attorney-client, joint defense or other privilege, except where the privilege is shared by TSYS and Synovus, as set forth in the Distribution Agreementand in which case will be governed by the terms of the Distribution Agreement, or (ii) has been prepared for the purpose of, or in contemplation of, TSYS, Synovus or any of their respective Group members, as the case may be, making a claim against another Party under this Agreement, the Distribution Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement.
Restriction on Access
          (e) . This Agreement shall not apply to Taxes (which are covered by the Tax Sharing Agreement).

          (g) No Synovus Indemnitee or TSYS Indemnitee, as applicable, may make any claim with respect to any Liability for indemnification or contribution under this Agreement to the extent that Section 5.2 of the Transition Services Agreement operates to exclude indemnification or contribution for such Liability.
Transition Services Agreement.
     
Section 1.6.
Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts on a Net-Tax Basis
.
          (a) Any Liability subject to indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Agreement will (i) be net of Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of the Liability, (ii) be net of any proceeds received by the Indemnitee from any third party for indemnification for such Liability that actually reduce the amount of the Liability ("") and (iii) will be determined on a Net-Tax Basis. Accordingly, the amount which any Indemnifying Party is required to pay pursuant to this Agreement to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds theretofore actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of the related Liability. If an Indemnitee receives a payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability (an "") and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.
Third Party Proceeds
Indemnity Payment
          (b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification and contributions provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto. The Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to collect or recover any third-party Insurance Proceeds and any Third Party Proceeds to which the Indemnified Party is entitled in connection with any Liability for which the Indemnified Party seeks contribution or indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; , that the Indemnitee's inability to collect or recover any such Insurance Proceeds or Third Party Proceeds shall not limit the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder.
provided
          (c) The term "Net-Tax Basis" as used in this Agreement means that, in determining the amount of the payment necessary to indemnify any party against, or reimburse any party for, Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities will be determined net of any actual reduction in Tax payable by the Indemnitee as the result of sustaining or paying such Liabilities after taking into account any Tax incurred on the receipt of Insurance Proceeds and Third Party Proceeds, and the amount of such Indemnity Payment will be increased (i.e., "grossed up") by the amount necessary to satisfy any income or franchise Tax Liabilities that will be incurred by the Indemnitee as a result of its receipt of, or right to receive, such Indemnity Payment (as so increased), so that the Indemnitee is put in the same net after-Tax economic position as if it had not incurred such Liabilities, in each case without taking into account any impact on the Tax basis that an Indemnitee has in its assets.
 
     .
Section 1.7.
Survival of Indemnities
          (a) Subject to Section 3.6, the rights and obligations of the Synovus Group and the TSYS Group under this Article I shall:
     (i) survive the sale or other transfer by any Party of any assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any Liabilities or the sale by any member of the Synovus Group and the TSYS Group of the capital stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary to any Person; and
     (ii) remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (x) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnitee; and (y) the knowledge by the Indemnitee of Liabilities for which it might be entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder.
     . As of the Effective Time, the TSYS Group shall retain (a) any and all rights as an insured party, where applicable, under each of the Shared Policies, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of such Shared Policies, with respect to all claims, suits, actions, proceedings, injuries, losses, Liabilities, damages and expenses incurred or claimed to have been incurred prior to the Effective Time by any person or party in connection with the conduct of the TSYS Business or, to the extent any claim is made against TSYS or any member of its Group regarding the conduct of the business of the Synovus Business, and which claims, suits, actions, proceedings, injuries, losses, Liabilities, damages and expenses arise out of an insured occurrence under one or more of such Shared Policies, and (b) any and all rights as an insured party, where applicable, under each of the TSYS Policies.
Section 2.1.
Insurance Policies and Rights After Distribution
     . Synovus agrees to use reasonable efforts to procure on behalf of TSYS a return of any unearned premiums due under the Shared Policies as a result of the TSYS Group no longer being an insured as of the Effective Time. Synovus agrees that TSYS is entitled to any such sums actually remitted, not to exceed, however, the actual amount TSYS paid as its premium allocation for any such Shared Policy.
Section 2.2.
Reimbursement for Unearned Premiums
     . If, subsequent to the Effective Time, any Person shall assert a claim against any member of the TSYS Group (including where a member of the TSYS Group is a joint defendant with any other person or entity) with respect to any claim, suit, action, proceeding, injury, loss, liability, damage or expense incurred or claimed to have been incurred prior to the Effective Time in connection with the conduct of the TSYS Business, or to the extent any claim is made against any member of the TSYS Group (including where a member of the TSYS Group is a joint defendant with any other person or entity) regarding the conduct of the Synovus Business, and which claim, suit, action, proceeding, injury, loss, liability, damage or expense arises out of an insured occurrence under one or more of the Shared Policies, Synovus shall assist TSYS in asserting such claim and assist TSYS in the collection of any
Section 2.3.
Post-Distribution Date Claims
 
Insurance Proceeds under such Shared Policy on behalf of the member of the TSYS Group and remit promptly to TSYS any Insurance Proceeds so collected, and Synovus shall further on behalf of TSYS assert any and all rights of an insured party under such Shared Policy with respect to such asserted claim, specifically including rights of indemnity and the right to be defended by or at the expense of the insurer and the right to any applicable Insurance Proceeds thereunder. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that nothing herein shall limit TSYS's right to assert such claims directly and collect Insurance Proceeds under any Shared Policy and that, should TSYS become liable for any Synovus Liabilities covered by any Shared Policy or any Synovus Policy, TSYS shall have the right to assert such claims directly and collect Insurance Proceeds under any such Shared Policy or Synovus Policy. Except as otherwise contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, after the Effective Time, neither Synovus nor TSYS shall (nor any member of their respective Group), without the consent of the other, provide any Shared Policy insurance carrier with a release, or amend, modify or waive any rights under any such policy or agreement, if such release, amendment, modification or waiver would adversely affect any rights or potential rights of the Synovus Group or the TSYS Group thereunder. However, nothing in this Section 2.3 shall (A) preclude any member of the Synovus Group or the TSYS Group that are insured under the Shared Policies from presenting any claim or from exhausting any policy limit or (B) require Synovus or TSYS (or any member of their respective Group) to renew, extend or continue any policy in force.
     . Subject to Section 2.5, from and after the Effective Time, TSYS, and TSYS alone, shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining insurance programs for its risk of loss and such insurance arrangements shall be separate and apart from the Synovus insurance programs. Synovus, upon the request of TSYS, from and after the Effective Time shall provide TSYS with any information that is in the possession of Synovus and is reasonably available and necessary for TSYS to obtain its insurance coverages.
Section 2.4.
TSYS Insurance Coverage After the Effective Time
     . The Parties shall procure for the benefit of Synovus and TSYS (and their respective directors, officers, any other insured persons, and Groups (including any directors and officers, and any other insured persons thereof)), run-off directors and officers liability insurance coverage, but solely with respect to coverage for "wrongful acts" (as customarily defined in such coverage) that were completed in whole prior to or at the Effective Time or commenced in part prior to the Effective Time and continued thereafter. Provided, however, that TSYS, and TSYS alone, shall be responsible for purchasing and maintaining any and all types of directors and officers liability insurance, other than the run-off coverage as outlined in this Section 2.5, including but not limited to coverage for the TSYS Group (and its respective Subsidiaries, directors and officers, and any other insured persons) for "wrongful acts" occurring solely after the Effective Time. Such run-off coverage for the benefit of Synovus and TSYS (and their respective directors, officers, any other insured persons, and Groups (including any directors and officers, and any other insured persons thereof)) shall be procured and non-cancelable for a six-year period commencing as of the Effective Time and shall include only the following policies and limits:
Section 2.5.
Run-Off Directors and Officers Insurance Coverage for TSYS and Synovus
a.     Primary traditional directors and officers insurance policy with an aggregate limit of $100,000,000 and on the same or comparable terms and conditions as currently provided under the directors and officers Shared Policy;
 
b.     Excess traditional directors and officers insurance policy with an aggregate limit of $25,000,000 and on the same or comparable terms and conditions as currently provided under the directors and officers Shared Policy; and
c.     Separate Side A Difference-In-Conditions ("DIC") insurance policies for the Synovus insured directors and officers and the TSYS insured directors and officers, each with an aggregate limit of $50,000,000, and on the same or comparable terms and conditions as currently provided under the separate Synovus and TSYS Side A DIC policies (collectively the "Run-Off Policies").
Synovus and TSYS, and their respective Groups, shall both be named insureds under the Run-Off Policies (except, however, the Side A DIC policies, each of which shall insure separately the Synovus directors and officers and the TSYS directors and officers), which policies and limits shall be accessible to both entities and their respective Subsidiaries, directors and officers, and/or any other insured persons, as applicable under the terms and conditions of such Run-Off Policies. Synovus and TSYS shall each pay one-half of the total premium and any other costs for the purchase of the Run-Off Policies. In the event that the applicable limits of the Run-Off Policies (except, however, the separate Side A DIC policies as outlined in this Section 2.5) are exceeded by the amount of outstanding Insured Claims by the Synovus Group and the TSYS Group, the Parties agree to allocate the Insurance Proceeds using the allocation method as provided in Section 2.7(c).
     . Each Party agrees that the other Party (and its Group members) shall have no Liability as a result of the other Party's insurance policies and practices as in effect at any time and arising from the level or scope of the other Party's insurance, the creditworthiness of any insurance carrier or the terms and conditions of any insurance policy of the other Party.
Section 2.6.
No Liability
     .
Section 2.7.
Administration and Other Matters
          (a) . Subject to Section 2.7(c) and Section 2.7(d), from and after the Effective Time, (i) Synovus shall be responsible for (A) Insurance Administration of the Shared Policies with respect to all Liabilities except TSYS Liabilities and (B) Claims Administration (except as provided below) under such Shared Policies with respect to all Liabilities except TSYS Liabilities, and (ii) TSYS shall be responsible for (A) Insurance Administration of the Shared Policies with respect to all TSYS Liabilities and (B) Claims Administration (except as provided below) under such Shared Policies with respect to all TSYS Liabilities; , , that the retention of such responsibilities by Synovus or TSYS, as the case may be, is in no way intended to limit, inhibit or preclude (i) any right to insurance coverage for any Insured Claim of a named insured under such Policies as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or (ii) the sharing between Synovus and TSYS of information relating to the matters addressed in this Article II; and that Synovus's retention or TSYS's retention, as the case may be, of the administrative responsibilities for the Shared Policies shall not relieve the party submitting any Insured Claim of the primary responsibility for reporting such Insured Claim accurately, completely and in a timely manner or of such party's authority to settle any such Insured Claim within any period permitted or required by the relevant Policy. Subject to Article I, each of the Parties hereto shall administer and pay any costs relating to its respective Insured Claims under Shared Policies to the extent such costs are not covered under such Policies and shall be

provided
however
provided further
 
responsible for obtaining or reviewing the appropriateness of releases upon settlement of its respective Insured Claims under Shared Policies. If an Insured Claim involves both TSYS Liabilities and Synovus Liabilities under such Shared Policies, TSYS and Synovus agree to share costs that are not covered under such policies in the same proportion as their respective liability for the Insured Claim, except to the extent that Article I applies to such costs in which case they shall be borne by the relevant Indemnifying Party.
          (b) . Where a Shared Policy specifically covers TSYS Liabilities for periods prior to the Effective Time or covers claims made after the Effective Time with respect to an occurrence prior to the Effective Time, then from and after the Effective Time TSYS may, subject to Section 2.7(c) and Section 2.7(d), claim coverage for Insured Claims under such Shared Policy as and to the extent that such insurance is available up to the full extent of the applicable limits of liability of such Shared Policy (and may receive any Insurance Proceeds with respect thereto as contemplated by Section 2.3 or Section 2.7(c) hereof), subject to the terms of this Section 2.7.
Claims
          (c) . Insurance Proceeds received with respect to claims, costs and expenses under the Shared Policies shall be paid directly to the appropriate Person or to Synovus, which shall thereafter administer the Shared Policies by paying the Insurance Proceeds, as appropriate, to Synovus with respect to Synovus Liabilities and to TSYS with respect to the TSYS Liabilities. Payment of the allocable portions of indemnity costs of Insurance Proceeds resulting from such Policies will be made by Synovus to the appropriate Person upon receipt from the insurance carrier. In the event that the applicable limits on any particular Shared Policy are exceeded by the amount of outstanding Insured Claims by Synovus and TSYS, the Parties agree to allocate the Insurance Proceeds received thereunder based upon their respective percentage of the total of their bona fide claims (measured as of the date costs related to such bona fide claims were incurred, such incurrence to be measured, (i) in the case of fees and expenses incurred for services performed that are attributable to the defense or disposition of Insured Claims, as of the date such fees and expenses are billed to an insurance carrier, and (ii) in the case of sums payable in settlement or satisfaction of a judgment attributable to Insured Claims, as of the date of any such settlement or judgment) which were covered under such Shared Policy (their allocable portion of Insurance Proceeds), and any party who has received Insurance Proceeds in excess of such party's allocable portion of Insurance Proceeds shall pay to the other party the appropriate amount so that each party will have received its allocable portion of Insurance Proceeds pursuant hereto. Each of the Parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize available coverage under those Shared Policies applicable to it, and to take all commercially reasonable steps to recover from all other responsible parties in respect of an Insured Claim to the extent coverage limits under a particular Shared Policy have been exceeded or would be exceeded as a result of such Insured Claim.
Allocation of Insurance Proceeds
          (d) . In the event that the Parties have bona fide claims under any Shared Policy for which a deductible or a retrospectively rated premium adjustment is payable or for which a self-insurance retention amount has been applied, the Parties agree that the aggregate amount of the deductible or retrospectively rated premium adjustment paid or retention amount applied shall be borne by the Parties in the same proportion which the Insurance Proceeds received by each such party bears to the total Insurance Proceeds received under the applicable Shared Policy (their "allocable share of the deductible, premium adjustment or retention amount"), and any party who has paid more than its allocable share of the deductible, premium
Allocation of Deductibles, Etc
 
adjustment or retention amount shall be entitled to receive from the other party an appropriate amount so that each party has borne its allocable share of the deductible, premium adjustment or retention amount pursuant hereto. Further, if a party receives no Insurance Proceeds under that applicable Shared Policy, that party shall have no allocable share of the deductible, premium adjustment or retention amount under that applicable Shared Policy, and the other party shall bear all of the allocable share of the deductible, premium adjustment or retention amount under that applicable Shared Policy.
     . In the event that Insured Claims of more than one of the Parties hereto exist relating to the same occurrence, the Parties shall jointly defend and waive any conflict of interest necessary to the conduct of the joint defense. Nothing in this Article II shall be construed to limit or otherwise alter in any way the obligations of the Parties to this Agreement, including those created by this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise.

     (c) In the case of a claim under Article II where no payment will be made to or received from a Taxing Authority, Section 5.3(b) shall be applied to the payments that would be made to or from a Taxing Authority if the TSYS Group were treated as a standalone group for all taxable periods.

Any information or documents relating to Taxes, including any such information provided under this Agreement, shall be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or with any Tax Contest.

Confidentiality
     Section 5.9 . On or prior to the Distribution Date, Synovus shall deliver or cause to be delivered to TSYS all materials, agreements, documents, books, records and files, if any, in the possession of Synovus or a Synovus Affiliate relating to Taxes of the TSYS Business.

The Independent Firm shall determine the appropriate outcome based on this Agreement with respect to each disputed item. The Independent Firm shall make such determinations within ninety (90) days from the date on which it is selected, unless the parties mutually agree to an extension of such period or the Independent Firm, in its discretion, determines that an extension of such period is warranted by exceptional circumstances. Any determination by the Independent Firm shall be in writing. Following the decision of the Independent Firm, Synovus and TSYS shall each take or cause to be taken any action necessary to implement the decision of the Independent Firm. The fees and expenses relating to the Independent Firm shall be borne by the party that such Independent Firm determines has lost the dispute. In all other events, the fees and expenses relating to the Independent Firm shall be shared based on the difference between the position taken by Synovus, on the one hand, and the position taken by TSYS, on the other hand, initially presented to the Independent Firm (based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a whole) and the final resolution as determined by the Independent Firm in proportion to the total difference between the initial position taken by Synovus and the initial position taken by TSYS. Any controversy concerning whether a Dispute is an arbitrable Dispute, whether arbitration has been waived, whether an assignee of this Agreement is bound to arbitrate, or as to the interpretation of enforceability of this Article VI shall be determined by the Independent Firm. In resolving any Dispute, the Parties intend that the Independent Firm apply the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the substantive laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the choice of law principles thereof that could mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. The Parties agree to comply with any award made by the Independent Firm pursuant to this Article VI and agree to enforcement of or entry of judgment upon such award, by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Independent Firm shall be entitled, if appropriate, to award any remedy in such proceedings available under this Agreement and Georgia law, including monetary damages, specific performance and all other forms of legal and equitable relief; provided, however, the Independent Firm shall not be entitled to award punitive, exemplary, multiple or any other forms of non-compensatory damages. Nothing contained herein is intended to or shall be construed to prevent any Party from applying to any court of competent jurisdiction for interim measures or other provisional relief in connection with the subject matter of any Dispute. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a court, the Independent Firm shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect the Independent Firm's orders to that effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF

 
Exhibit 99.1
     TSYS (NYSE:TSS), one of the world's largest providers of outsourced payment services, today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a one-time special cash dividend of $600 million to be paid on a pro rata basis to its shareholders, including Synovus, in connection with the previously announced spin-off to Synovus' shareholders of the shares of TSYS stock currently owned by Synovus. The dividend will be paid on Dec. 31, 2007, to TSYS shareholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 17, 2007. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of distribution, Synovus will receive approximately $485 million in proceeds from this one-time special cash dividend.
Columbus, Ga., Nov. 30, 2007 
     Based on the number of TSYS shares outstanding as of Oct. 31, 2007, it is expected that TSYS shareholders as of the record date will receive $3.03 per share. The final per share dividend will be determined based on the number of TSYS shares outstanding on the record date.
     TSYS also will pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 17, 2007, including Synovus, in the amount of $.07 per share. This dividend will be paid on Jan. 2, 2008.
     In addition, Synovus today announced that its Board of Directors has set Dec. 18, 2007, as the record date for the previously announced spin-off to Synovus' shareholders of the shares of TSYS stock currently owned by Synovus. Synovus currently owns approximately 80.7 percent of TSYS. The distribution of the approximately 159.6 million TSYS shares owned by Synovus will be made on a pro rata basis on Dec. 31, 2007, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on the Dec. 18 record date.
     TSYS has been advised that, in connection with the spin-off, a "when-issued" public market for TSYS common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) will begin shortly after the final amount of the per-share special cash dividend is determined, which is expected to be on or around December 19, 2007, and continue through the distribution date under the symbol The "when-issued" public market will be a market for shares of TSYS common stock that will be distributed to Synovus shareholders on the distribution date. In addition, TSYS expects to be quoted "ex-dividend" on the NYSE beginning on or around December 19, 2007. Any holder of TSYS common stock who sells shares of TSYS (which currently trades on the NYSE under the symbol "TSS") in the "regular way" market before the date "ex-dividend" trading begins will be selling the entitlement to receive the special cash dividend and regular quarterly cash dividend. Holders of TSYS common stock are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors regarding the specific implications of selling TSYS common stock before the date "ex-dividend" trading begins.
