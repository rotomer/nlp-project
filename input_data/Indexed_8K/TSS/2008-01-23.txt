TSYS today announced the results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2007. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, TSYS reported basic earnings per share of $1.21 for the year and $0.23 for the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis excluding one-time spin costs of $0.11 for the year and $0.11 for the quarter, TSYS reported basic earnings per share of $1.32 for the year and $0.34 for the fourth quarter. Spin related costs are considered non-recurring by TSYS and were incurred in connection with the distribution of the 80.6% ownership of TSYS by Synovus Financial Corp. (Synovus) to its shareholders on December 31, 2007.
Columbus, Ga., January 23, 2008 
          This press release includes pro forma financial information that is not in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP is included in this press release in the form of a table that should be read in conjunction with this information.
          "As we celebrate our 25th anniversary as a public company, we will certainly remember 2007 as the year of the spin' from Synovus Financial Corp. Synovus has been a wonderful majority owner for 25 years and we salute them. Our new independence gives us greater flexibility as we move forward with our long-term growth strategy. With passion and dedication, our team overcame many one-time obstacles in 2007 and once again highlighted our unique position in the industry," said Philip W. Tomlinson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer.
 
          "The year 2007 was an exceptional year for TSYS. Our international revenues grew 33% over 2006, and we expect strong growth to continue. We also generated 15% organic growth for the year in electronic payment processing revenues which contributed to our operating margin expanding to 25.7% of revenues before reimbursables," said Tomlinson.
          "We are looking forward to 2008 and beyond as we continue to reach out across the globe as an international organization dedicated to being the best and most cost effective provider of payment processing services in the world. As indicated in our Guidance Table below, we expect TSYS' total revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 9% in 2008, and now expect net income and basic earnings per share to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, up from the previously announced 4% to 6%," said Tomlinson.

Projected Outlook for 2008
TSYS' 2008 earnings forecast is based on the following assumptions:
 
 
     Presentation of revenues and earnings excluding the spin-related costs, revenues associated with deconverted portfolios, termination fee and reimbursable items are non-GAAP financial measures. The following table is a reconciliation of the range of changes from 2006 to 2007 and 2007 to 2008, comparing non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures for 2006 and 2007 and estimated financial measures for 2008.
 
 
     TSYS believes the table above presents meaningful information to assist investors in understanding the company's changes in total revenues and net income from 2006 to 2007 and estimates in changes from 2007 to 2008 as a result of the Bank of America consumer portfolio deconversion and spin-related costs as the non-GAAP financial measures exclude amounts that the company does not consider part of ongoing operating results. The non-GAAP financial percentage changes should not be considered by themselves or as a substitute for the GAAP percentage changes year over year. The non-GAAP measures should be considered as an additional view of the way TSYS' financial measures are affected by the one-time Bank of America contract termination fee, acceleration of amortization of contract acquisition costs and reimbursable items and spin-related costs; and should be used in conjunction with all publicly filed financial statements and reports.
