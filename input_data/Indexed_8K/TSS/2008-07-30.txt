Operating Segments
During the second quarter, TSYS renamed its reportable operating segments in a manner that reflects the way management views the business. The segments are now referred to as North American Services, Global Services and Merchant Services.

Year-to-date total revenues for the North American Services segment were $650.7 million, an increase of 2.9%, compared to $632.1 million for the same period last year.

Global Services
For the second quarter of 2008, total revenues for the Global Services segment were $79.6 million, an increase of 31.9%, compared to $60.4 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date total revenues for the Global Services segment were $149.0 million, an increase of 28.9%, compared to $115.5 million for the same period last year. The increase is driven by growth in accounts and transactions processed.
     Key drivers for the Global Services segment include:
Merchant Services

Year-to-date total revenues for the Merchant Services segment were $145.1 million, an increase of 2.1%, compared to $142.1 million for the same period last year.

     For the second quarter and first six months of 2008, Merchant Services segment results were impacted by price compression and deconversions. However, Merchant Services segment experienced solid growth in sequential POS and back-end volumes.
Overview and Outlook
Addressing the company's second quarter and year to date results, Philip W. Tomlinson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of TSYS said: "Given the economic environment that our clients are struggling with, we are extremely pleased with our quarterly consolidated total revenue growth of 5% over 2007, and our year to date growth of 6%."
     "Our North American Services segment year to date total revenues growth of 2.9% and operating margin of 29.5%, as compared to 27.3% for the same period last year, reflects our ability to manage expenses in a slowing US economy. Our electronic payment processing business is very solid with many clients who are among the stalwarts of the US economy."
     "Our Merchant Services segment, which is also primarily based in the US, grew its revenue 2.1% over the first six months of 2007. The takeaway from this segment is that it contributed significantly to operating income with its margins increasing 449 basis points over 2007's to 29.4%. Sequentially, we have seen growth in transaction volumes of 7%."
     "Our Global Services segment grew total revenues 28.9% over the first six months of 2007. In addition, its quarterly revenues were up 31.9% over 2007's second quarter and sequentially over the first quarter of 2008 by 14.7%. As we expected, Global Services' operating margins increased 428 basis points over the first quarter to 15.3% and we expect that margin to continue its improvement over the remainder of the year. Global Services remains a very strong driver of our revenue growth."
     "On a consolidated basis, we include in our management review changes in revenues before reimbursables excluding those clients' portfolios that deconverted year over year. On that basis, our quarterly revenues before reimbursables increased 9.2% over 2007's second quarter and our year to date growth was 10.2%. Included in this press release is a table reconciling these non-GAAP metrics to our GAAP reported revenues before reimbursables. Consolidated operating income included $8.1 million of one-time spin expenses. Excluding these items, our operating income margin was 26.3% which was a 63 basis point increase over the first six months of 2007. These results are in line with expectations that our ability to manage expenses in relation to our top line growth is rigorous."
     "At the mid-point of 2008, we have seen many of our clients' financial results suffering as a result of the slowing economies around the world and the worst turmoil we have ever seen in the financial markets. This has obviously had a negative impact on their performance and expectations; and we are no exception."
 
     "Our analysis shows that we would have to grow consolidated revenues before reimbursables by 7.3% and total revenues by 11.7% over 2007's second half results in order to achieve the low end of our guidance for 2008. We started 2008 with great enthusiasm and expectation that our historical trends of client activity would continue. It is now apparent that our clients' activity is being hampered by the economic environment, which has greatly deteriorated since our original forecast. Our estimates for the remainder of 2008 have resulted in lowering our full year guidance for revenues before reimbursables to the 5% to 7% range versus our previous guidance of 8% to 10%. Total revenue guidance is now estimated at 6% to 8% versus previous guidance of 7% to 9%. Full year guidance for EPS is being reduced from 7% to 9% to the 5% to 7% range resulting in estimates on a GAAP basis of $1.27 to $1.29 and excluding one-time spin costs from $1.32 to $1.34.
     As previously discussed in our quarterly conference calls, there has been a significant shift to reimbursable revenues due to contract changes in our debt collection business. These revenues are now estimated to be in the $420 to $430 million range versus previous guidance of $391 to $399 million. We have included an updated table in this press release reflecting these adjustments to our guidance along with reconciliations to GAAP."
     "We are enthusiastic about our future prospects and our ability to meet the challenges of these very stressful economic times. We continue to develop innovative products and state of the art technology for our clients that enhance their ability to get information faster, better and cheaper to use in the management of their portfolios. We don't just do business with our clients, we partner with them."
Projected Outlook for 2008
TSYS expects its 2008 net income to increase between 5-7%, as compared to 2007, based on the following assumptions:
 
 
 
     Presentation of revenues and earnings excluding the spin-related costs, revenues associated with deconverted portfolios, and reimbursable items are non-GAAP financial measures. The following table is a reconciliation of the range of changes from 2007 to 2008, comparing non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures for 2007 and estimated financial measures for 2008.
     TSYS believes the table above and the table on page 15 present meaningful information to assist investors in understanding the company's changes in total revenues and net income from estimates in changes from 2007 to 2008 as a result of deconverted portfolios and spin-related costs as the non-GAAP financial measures exclude amounts that the company does not consider part of ongoing operating results. TSYS believes the information is useful for investors because it
 
can provide a more complete understanding of TSYS' underlying operational performance. The non-GAAP financial percentage changes should not be considered by themselves or as a substitute for the GAAP percentage changes year over year. The non-GAAP measures should be considered as an additional view of the way TSYS' financial measures are affected by deconverted portfolios, reimbursable items and spin-related costs; and should be used in conjunction with all publicly filed financial statements and reports.
