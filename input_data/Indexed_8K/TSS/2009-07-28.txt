To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 25 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed by the corporation or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made by the corporation, whichever first occurs.

TSYS (NYSE: TSS) today reported second quarter total revenues of $412.0 million, a 1% increase over the first quarter of 2009. These revenues included an unfavorable impact of $17.8 million from foreign currency exchange rates during the quarter when compared to the same period a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, total revenues on a constant currency basis would have been $429.8 million.
Columbus, Ga., July 28, 2009 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2009 were $0.27. Despite the headwinds of foreign currency exchange rates and upfront costs related to international expansion, TSYS' second quarter operating margins increased sequentially by 100 basis points and net income increased 5.2%.
Quarterly Highlights
"While the economic environment continues to be challenging, we saw improvements in our financial results as evidenced by the improvement in our sequential total revenues, operating income and net income. In addition, our International Services segment's operating margin increased to 12.6% from 8.5% on a sequential quarter basis. We continue to be committed to growing our revenues by signing and converting new clients and managing our costs," said Philip W. Tomlinson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of TSYS.
 
"With the conversion of Deutsche Bank in Germany now complete, we continue to expand our global presence and will add more business when the conversion of Carrefour in Brazil is completed in early 2010. These wins in the international marketplace are a key component of our growth strategy, and we expect to continue adding new clients," said Tomlinson.
"Our pursuit of acquisition opportunities continues. Our cash increased $133.1 million since year-end, and our operations continue to generate significant amounts of cash. We plan on deploying this cash and our debt capacity as we actively pursue acquisitions that fit our corporate strategy," said Tomlinson.
TSYS is negotiating with a potential buyer for the sale of TSYS Debt Management (TDM), a subsidiary of TSYS, which is involved in the legal collections management and bankruptcy processing business. During the second quarter, TDM recognized a one-time gain related to a partial recovery of a previously resolved client issue, which resulted in a net gain of $771,000 in discontinued operations.
TSYS reaffirms its previously released guidance for 2009 of declines in revenues of 5% to 3% and net income of 13% to 11%.
Non-GAAP Measures
TSYS has included a schedule with this release that provides revenues and operating results on a constant currency basis. This non-GAAP measure presents second quarter and year-to-date 2009 financial results using the previous year's foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, TSYS' International Services segment's total revenues grew 18% as compared to a reported GAAP decline of 4%, and operating income grew 4% versus a GAAP reported decline of 22%.
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures to describe TSYS' performance. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the financial tables of this release.
The non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency presented by TSYS are utilized by management to better understand and assess TSYS' operating results and financial performance. TSYS also uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and assess TSYS' financial performance against budget, as well as to evaluate financial performance for executive and management compensation purposes.
TSYS believes that non-GAAP financial measures are important to enable investors to understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results. Accordingly, TSYS includes non-GAAP financial measures when reporting its financial results to shareholders and investors in order to provide them with an additional tool to evaluate TSYS' ongoing business operations. TSYS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are representative of comparative financial performance that reflects the economic substance of TSYS' current and ongoing business operations.
Although non-GAAP financial measures are often used to measure TSYS' operating results and assess its financial performance, they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.
 
TSYS provides reconciliations for each of its non-GAAP financial measures with its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, whenever it is used. This enables shareholders and potential investors to easily assess the impact of any differences between the measure TSYS is presenting and similarly titled captions of other companies.
TSYS believes that its use of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with the same key financial performance indicators that are utilized by management to assess TSYS' operating results, evaluate the business and make operational decisions on a prospective, going-forward basis. Hence, management provides disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures to give shareholders and potential investors an opportunity to see TSYS as viewed by management, to assess TSYS with some of the same tools that management utilizes internally and to be able to compare such information with prior periods. TSYS believes that the presentation of GAAP financial measures alone would not provide its shareholders and potential investors with the ability to appropriately analyze its ongoing operational results, and therefore expected future results. TSYS therefore believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional information to help them better understand its financial statements just as management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand the business, manage budgets and allocate resources.

These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding TSYS' expectation it will continue to add new international clients, TSYS' earnings forecast for 2009, and the assumptions underlying such statements. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS' management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) movements in LIBOR are greater than expected and draws on the remaining balance of the credit facility are greater than expected; (2) TSYS incurs expenses associated with
 
the signing of a significant client; (3) adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates; (4) adverse developments with respect to entering into contracts with new clients and retaining current clients; (5) continued consolidation and turmoil in the financial services industry throughout 2009, including the merger of TSYS clients with entities that are not TSYS processing clients, the sale of portfolios by TSYS clients to entities that are not TSYS processing clients and the seizure by banking regulators of TSYS clients; (6) additional significant one-time spin costs are incurred; (7) TSYS is unable to control expenses and increase market share; (8) TSYS is unable to manage the impact of slowing economic conditions and consumer spending; (9) the material breach of security of any of TSYS' systems; (10) the impact of acquisitions, including their being more difficult to integrate than anticipated; (11) changes occur in laws, rules, regulations, credit card association rules or other industry standards affecting TSYS' business which require significant product development efforts or reduce the market demand for or value of its products; (12) adverse developments with respect to the credit card industry in general, including a decline in the use of credit cards as a payment mechanism; and (13) growth rates of TSYS' existing clients are lower than anticipated whether as a result of unemployment rates, card delinquencies and charge-off rates or otherwise. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on
Form 10-K
, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on
Form 8-K
. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position Emerging Issues Task Force No. 03-6-1 (FSP EITF 03-6-1), and it became effective for TSYS beginning January 1, 2009. Under this standard, unvested awards of share-based payments with rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, such as our nonvested awards, are considered participating securities for purposes of calculating earnings per share ("EPS"). Under the two-class method required by EITF 03-6-1, a portion of net income is allocated to these participating securities and therefore is excluded from the calculation of EPS allocated to common stock, as shown in the table above. This FSP requires retrospective applications for periods prior to the effective date and as a result, all prior period earnings per share data presented herein have been adjusted to conform to these provisions.
