TSYS today reported results for the first quarter with basic earnings per share at $0.30, an increase of 18.6% over 2011. Total revenues for the quarter were $461.2 million, an increase of 7.4%. Revenues before reimbursable items were $395.2 million, an increase of 9.0% for the quarter.
COLUMBUS, Ga., April 24, 2012 
"Our first quarter results continue to benefit from strong same client transaction growth, which was 14.4% in our card issuer processing business, when compared to last year. POS transactions, excluding deconverted clients in our indirect business, were up 11% and sales volume from our direct merchant business was up 20.9% over same quarter last year. Operating income was $84.8 million, resulting in an increase of 16.2% over last year. Our consolidated organic revenue growth of 7.7% for the quarter was the main driver in our results. This quarter represents the 8th consecutive quarter that we reported positive year-over-year growth in revenues before reimbursable items," said Philip W. Tomlinson, chairman and chief executive officer of TSYS.
During the quarter, TSYS signed new contracts with Huntington Bancshares and Regions to process their credit card portfolios. In addition, a long-term agreement with The Royal Bank of Scotland for its UK, Irish and U.S. consumer credit and commercial businesses was renewed. "We continue to pursue our vision of being the leading global payment solutions provider through acquisitions and by putting people at the center of payments. We continue to believe TSYS will achieve our guidance of double digit growth in earnings per share and a solid top line revenue increase in 2012," said Tomlinson.

Non-GAAP Measures
The financial highlights section of this release contains the non-GAAP financial measures of revenues and operating results on a constant currency basis to describe TSYS' performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and assess TSYS' operating results and financial performance. TSYS believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about TSYS to assist investors in understanding and evaluating its operating results.
Additional information about non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included on pages 11 and 12 of this release.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements"  that is, statements related to future, not past, events. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "should," "plan," "will," "could," and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding TSYS' belief that it will achieve its guidance of double digit growth in earnings per share and a solid top line revenue increase in 2012, and the assumptions underlying such statements. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS' management, are based on management's assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to: continued consolidation and turmoil in the financial services and other industries during 2012, including the merger of TSYS clients with entities that are not TSYS processing clients, the sale of portfolios by TSYS clients to entities that are not TSYS processing clients and the nationalization or seizure by banking regulators of TSYS clients; TSYS is unable to control expenses and increase market share both domestically and internationally; TSYS is unable to manage the impact of slowing economic conditions and consumer spending; the material breach
 
 
of security of any of TSYS' systems; the impact of potential and completed acquisitions, including the costs associated therewith and their being more difficult to integrate than anticipated; adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates; expenses are incurred associated with the signing of a significant client; the deconversion of a significant client; the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on TSYS and on our clients; changes occur in laws, rules, regulations, credit card association rules or other industry standards affecting TSYS and our clients that may result in costly new compliance burdens on TSYS and our clients and lead to a decrease in the volume and/or number of transactions processed; the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments relating thereto; adverse developments with respect to the credit card industry in general, including a decline in the use of credit cards as a payment mechanism; and internal growth rates of TSYS' existing clients are lower than anticipated whether as a result of unemployment rates, card delinquencies and charge-off rates or otherwise. Additional risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Non-GAAP Measures
The schedule below provides a reconciliation of revenues and operating results on a constant currency basis to reported revenues and operating income. This non-GAAP measure presents year-to-date 2012 financial results using the previous year's foreign currency exchange rates. On a year-to-date constant currency basis, TSYS' total revenues grew 7.6% as compared to a reported GAAP increase of 7.4%
The non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and revenues, with respect to year-to-date revenues and basic EPS presented by TSYS, are utilized by management to better understand and assess TSYS' operating results and financial performance. TSYS also uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and assess TSYS' financial performance against budget, as well as to evaluate financial performance for executive and management compensation purposes.
TSYS believes that non-GAAP financial measures are important to enable investors to understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results. Accordingly, TSYS includes non-GAAP financial measures when reporting its financial results to shareholders and investors in order to provide them with an additional tool to evaluate TSYS' ongoing business operations. TSYS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are representative of comparative financial performance that reflects the economic substance of TSYS' current and ongoing business operations.
Although non-GAAP financial measures are often used to measure TSYS' operating results and assess its financial performance, they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.
TSYS believes that its use of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with the same key financial performance indicators that are utilized by management to assess TSYS' operating results, evaluate the business and make operational decisions on a prospective, going-forward basis. Hence, management provides disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures to give shareholders and potential investors an opportunity to see TSYS as viewed by management, to assess TSYS with some of the same tools that management utilizes internally and to be able to compare such information with prior periods. TSYS believes that the presentation of GAAP financial measures alone would not provide its shareholders and potential investors with the ability to appropriately analyze its ongoing operational results, and therefore expected future results. TSYS therefore believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional information to help them better understand its financial statements just as management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand the business, manage budgets and allocate resources.
