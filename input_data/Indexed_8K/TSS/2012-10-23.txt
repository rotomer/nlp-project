TSYS (NYSE: TSS) today reported results for the third quarter of 2012. For the quarter, basic earnings per share was $0.32, an increase of 5.7% over 2011. Revenues before reimbursable items were $406.1 million and operating income was $90.9 million, increases of 4.1% and 12.0%, respectively, as compared to 2011. Total revenues for the quarter were $468.1 million, an increase of 1.8% over 2011, and were impacted by a decrease of $7.6 million in reimbursable items.
COLUMBUS, Ga., October 23, 2012 
The operating margin for the quarter was 22.4%, an increase of 157 basis points over the third quarter of last year. The increase is attributable to the 4.1% increase in revenues before reimbursable items while expenses before reimbursable items were up 2.0%.
POS transactions, excluding deconverted clients in the indirect merchant business, were up 9.5% and sales volume in the direct merchant business was up 17.4%. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, sales volume was up 9.3%. North America and International issuer processing businesses grew with same client transactions up 10.1% over last year.
"In August, TSYS formed a joint venture with Central Payment Co., LLC to further strengthen our sales distribution channels in the direct merchant business. Also during the quarter, we spent $61.2 million as we purchased 2.6 million shares of our stock bringing our share repurchases since September 2010 to 12.3 million and a total spend of $227.0 million. We continue to see value in our buyback program, absent a strategic acquisition, and have 7.7 million shares remaining under the plan that expires in April 2014. We also closed a new credit facility of $500 million this quarter with a 5-year term loan of $150 million and a 5-year revolver of $350 million that included nine banks. This new revolver, along with our free cash flow, will provide us with more financial flexibility as we continue to make investments that we expect to grow our company and enhance shareholder return," said Tomlinson.

Additional information about non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included on pages 11 and 12 of this release.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements"  that is, statements related to future, not past, events. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "should," "plan," "will," "could," and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding TSYS expectation that the investments TSYS makes will grow the company and enhance shareholder return, and the assumptions underlying such statements. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS' management, are based on management's assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking
 
 
statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS' ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the ultimate results of TSYS' investments may not have a positive impact on TSYS' business as is currently expected for a number of reasons including fluctuations in the price of our stock and acquired companies not performing as expected. Additional risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Non-GAAP Measures
The schedule below provides a reconciliation of revenues and operating results on a constant currency basis to reported revenues and operating income. This non-GAAP measure presents year-to-date 2012 financial results using the previous year's foreign currency exchange rates. On a year-to-date constant currency basis, TSYS' total revenues grew 4.6% as compared to a reported GAAP increase of 4.1%.
The non-GAAP financial measures of constant currency and revenues , with respect to year-to-date revenues and basic EPS presented by TSYS, are utilized by management to better understand and assess TSYS' operating results and financial performance. TSYS also uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and assess TSYS' financial performance against budget, as well as to evaluate financial performance for executive and management compensation purposes.
TSYS believes that non-GAAP financial measures are important to enable investors to understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results. Accordingly, TSYS includes non-GAAP financial measures when reporting its financial results to shareholders and investors in order to provide them with an additional tool to evaluate TSYS' ongoing business operations. TSYS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are representative of comparative financial performance that reflects the economic substance of TSYS' current and ongoing business operations.
Although non-GAAP financial measures are often used to measure TSYS' operating results and assess its financial performance, they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.
TSYS believes that its use of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with the same key financial performance indicators that are utilized by management to assess TSYS' operating results, evaluate the business and make operational decisions on a prospective, going-forward basis. Hence, management provides disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures to give shareholders and potential investors an opportunity to see TSYS as viewed by management, to assess TSYS with some of the same tools that management utilizes internally and to be able to compare such information with prior periods. TSYS believes that the presentation of GAAP financial measures alone would not provide its shareholders and potential investors with the ability to appropriately analyze its ongoing operational results, and therefore expected future results. TSYS therefore believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional information to help them better understand its financial statements just as management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand the business, manage budgets and allocate resources.
