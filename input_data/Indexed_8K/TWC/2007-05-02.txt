Subscriber Growth Accelerated in All Key Services
Revenue Generating Unit Net Additions of 910,000, a 35% Increase Over Fourth Quarter
Revenues Increased 61%, Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Rose 54% and Operating Income Grew 28%
Revenues Increased 10%, Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Rose 12% and Operating Income Grew 11% Over Pro Forma Prior Year Quarter
Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE: TWC) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
NEW YORK, NY, May 2, 2007 
Time Warner Cable President and Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt said, "I'm pleased to report that effective execution of our strategy generated very strong results in Time Warner Cable's first quarter as a public company. With 61% growth in revenues over the prior year and the net addition of 910,000 revenue generating units, a robust 35% increase in revenue generating unit net additions over the prior quarter, we are on track to deliver on our full year business outlook. We accelerated quarterly subscriber net additions in all key services, including basic and digital video, residential high-speed data and Digital Phone. We are also moving closer to completing the integration of the Acquired Systems, and by year-end expect these systems to offer Time Warner Cable's advanced residential services."
Mr. Britt continued: "We will continue to build on this momentum throughout 2007 by executing on the fundamental building blocks of our strategy. We'll grow our customer base by delivering innovative services in bundled packages that provide a clear, compelling value proposition. Looking ahead, we see opportunities to build even more value and drive further growth for our shareholders. As one example, we have begun to offer voice services to small- to medium-sized businesses in five cities, and we expect to complete deployment in most of our Legacy Systems by year-end. In addition, we have launched our first set of wireless services in conjunction with Sprint under the brand name "Pivot" in five cities, and we plan to roll out these services further this year. We will introduce these and all new services with the same disciplined approach that has served us so well in the past."

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
On July 31, 2006, a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable, Time Warner NY Cable LLC ("TW NY"), acquired certain cable systems from Adelphia Communications Corporation, Comcast Corporation's ("Comcast") interests in Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. were redeemed, and TW NY and Comcast also exchanged certain cable systems. Collectively, these acquisitions and dispositions are referred to as the "Transactions."
On January 1, 2007, Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. ("TKCCP"), an unconsolidated joint venture between Time Warner Cable and Comcast, distributed its assets to its partners. Time Warner Cable received the systems in Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico (the "Kansas City Pool"), which served approximately 788,000 basic video subscribers at December 31, 2006, and began consolidating the financial results of the Kansas City Pool on January 1, 2007.
For the presentation of subscriber information, the systems that the Company acquired in the Transactions, which served approximately 3.8 million basic video subscribers at March 31, 2007, are referred to as the "Acquired Systems." Those systems that the Company owned both before and after the Transactions as well as the Kansas City Pool, which together served approximately 9.6 million basic video subscribers at March 31, 2007, are referred to as the "Legacy Systems."
For the presentation of financial information, however, "Legacy Systems" refers only to those systems that the Company owned both before and after the Transactions and does not include the Kansas City Pool (the financial results of which the Company has shown separately). The "Acquired Systems" has the same definition as above.
The pro forma financial information for the first quarter of 2006 presents the results as if the Transactions had occurred, and the Kansas City Pool had been consolidated, on January 1, 2006.
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
in the first quarter rose 61% ($1.5 billion) over the first quarter of 2006 to $3.9 billion, due primarily to the addition of the Acquired Systems ($971 million), the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($212 million) and 12% growth in the Legacy Systems.
Revenues
Subscription revenues increased 61% ($1.4 billion) to $3.7 billion. Video revenues grew 59% ($930 million) to $2.5 billion due to the addition of the Acquired Systems ($695 million) and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($135 million), as well as the continued increase in penetration of advanced digital video services, video price increases and subscriber growth in the Legacy Systems. High-speed data revenues increased 57% ($326 million) to $894 million, driven mainly by the addition of the Acquired Systems ($197 million), the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($49 million) and continued subscriber growth in the Legacy Systems. Voice revenues climbed 97% ($130 million) to $264 million, primarily as a result of strong Digital Phone subscriber growth in the Legacy Systems.
Advertising revenues climbed 73% ($80 million) to $189 million, due primarily to the addition of the Acquired Systems ($64 million) and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($9 million).
grew 54% ($456 million) compared to the first quarter of 2006 to $1.3 billion, benefiting from revenue growth, offset partially by increases in operating expenses, primarily video programming and employee expenses, as a result of the addition of the Acquired Systems and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool. Total programming expense increased 73% ($370 million) to $880 million. The increase in video programming costs was due to the addition of the Acquired Systems ($257 million) and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($50 million), as well as increases in contractual rates, video subscriber growth and the expansion of service offerings in the Legacy Systems. Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization also included merger-related and restructuring charges of $10 million in the first quarter of both 2007 and 2006.
Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization

Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization in the first quarter of 2006 included a benefit of approximately $21 million, due to changes in estimates related to prior period medical benefit accruals, as well as an $11 million benefit reflecting an adjustment in the amortization of certain launch support payments.
increased 28% ($127 million) over the first quarter of 2006 to $579 million, due primarily to the increase in Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization, offset partially by higher depreciation ($269 million) and amortization ($60 million) expenses. The increase in depreciation was primarily due to the addition of the Acquired Systems, the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool and demand-driven increases in recent years of purchases of customer premise equipment. The increase in amortization was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with customer relationships acquired as part of the Transactions.
Operating Income
in the first quarter totaled $1.0 billion.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
in the first quarter totaled $720 million, an increase of $248 million compared to capital spending from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2006. The increase in capital spending was associated with the Acquired Systems as well as the continued roll-out of advanced digital services and the continued growth in high-speed data services in the Legacy Systems.
Capital Spending
in the first quarter of 2007 totaled $224 million and net debt on March 31, 2007, was $14.4 billion.
Free Cash Flow
Income and Per Share Results
For the first quarter of 2007, Income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change and Net income were both $276 million, or $0.28 per basic and diluted common share. This compares to Income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of 2006 of $204 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted common share, and Net income in the first quarter of 2006 of $237 million, or $0.23 per basic and diluted common share.
Certain items in the current quarter affected comparability, including a gain as a result of the distribution of TKCCP's assets, which was treated as a sale of the Company's 50% equity interest in the Houston area systems of TKCCP. This item had the net effect of increasing the current quarter's Income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change and Net income by approximately $81 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted common share. Excluding this item, both Income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change and Net income decreased for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to the first quarter of 2006 due to higher interest expense and minority interest expense and lower income from equity investments, offset in part by an increase in Operating Income.

FIRST QUARTER PRO FORMA RESULTS
Compared to pro forma results for the first quarter of 2006, revenues in the first quarter of 2007 increased 10% ($349 million) to $3.9 billion and Subscription revenues rose 10% ($333 million).
Compared to pro forma results for the first quarter of 2006, Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization in the first quarter of 2007 climbed 12% ($137 million) to $1.3 billion and Operating Income increased 11% ($58 million) to $579 million.

Use of Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow
Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA") is a financial measure not calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company defines OIBDA as Operating Income before depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets. Management utilizes OIBDA, among other measures, in evaluating the performance of the Company's business because OIBDA eliminates the uneven effect across its business of considerable amounts of depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also a significant component of the Company's annual incentive compensation
6
 
programs. OIBDA is also a measure used by the Company's parent, Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner"), to evaluate the Company's performance and is an important metric in the Time Warner reportable segment disclosures. Management also uses OIBDA because it provides an indication of the Company's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures, as OIBDA removes the impact of depreciation and amortization. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's business. To compensate for this limitation, management evaluates the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budget variances, investment spending levels and return on capital analysis. Additionally, OIBDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, Operating Income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities (as defined under GAAP) plus excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, less cash provided by (used by) discontinued operations, capital expenditures, partnership distributions and principal payments on capital leases. Management uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate the Company's business. It is also a significant component of the Company's annual incentive compensation programs. The Company believes this measure is an important indicator of its liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt and make strategic investments, because it reflects the Company's operating cash flow after considering the significant capital expenditures required to operate its business. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect payments made in connection with investments and acquisitions, which reduce liquidity. To compensate for this limitation, management evaluates such expenditures through other financial measures such as return on investment analyses. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Both OIBDA and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's Operating Income, net income and various cash flow measures (e.g., cash provided by operating activities), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
     On July 31, 2006, a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), Time Warner NY Cable LLC ("TW NY"), and Comcast Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "Comcast") completed the acquisition of substantially all of the cable assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation (the "Adelphia Acquisition"), Comcast's interests in TWC and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. were redeemed (the "Redemptions"), and TW NY and Comcast exchanged certain cable systems (the "Exchange" and, together with the Adelphia Acquisition and the Redemptions, the "Transactions"). The cable systems transferred to Comcast in connection with the Redemptions and the Exchange (the "Transferred Systems"), including gains recognized on the transfers, have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
2. TEXAS AND KANSAS CITY CABLE PARTNERS, L.P. JOINT VENTURE
     As previously disclosed, Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. ("TKCCP") is a 50-50 joint venture between a consolidated subsidiary of TWC (Time Warner Entertainment-Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("TWE-A/N")) and Comcast. On January 1, 2007, TKCCP distributed its assets to its partners. TWC received certain cable assets located in Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico (the "Kansas City Pool"), which served approximately 788,000 basic video subscribers as of December 31, 2006, and Comcast received the pool of assets consisting of the Houston cable systems (the "Houston Pool"), which served approximately 795,000 basic video subscribers as of December 31, 2006. TWC began consolidating the results of the Kansas City Pool on January 1, 2007. TWC expects that TKCCP will be formally dissolved in the second quarter of 2007. For accounting purposes, TWC has treated the distribution of TKCCP's assets as a sale of TWC's 50% equity interest in the Houston Pool and as an acquisition of Comcast's 50% equity interest in the Kansas City Pool. As a result of the sale of TWC's 50% equity interest in the Houston Pool, TWC recorded a pretax gain of approximately $146 million in the first quarter of 2007, which is included as a component of other income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations.
