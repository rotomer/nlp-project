Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE: TWC) today reported financial results for its full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007.
NEW YORK, NY, February 6, 2008 
Time Warner Cable President and Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt said: "We close the books on 2007 having met or exceeded all of the elements of our full-year business outlook and are eager to build on that success in the coming year. I am pleased that the Acquired Systems, including Los Angeles and Dallas, have turned a corner and are poised to make a meaningful contribution in 2008."
Mr. Britt continued: "To achieve our ambitious goals, we're ready to fight for every single customer by delivering the innovative products and services that they want  today. We're very well prepared to compete, and we are focused on improving our position every day. Beyond competing for customers in our existing businesses, we're expanding into commercial services that we believe can substantially boost our results over time. We remain confident that, by maintaining our strict capital spending discipline, we can generate robust free cash flow growth for the foreseeable future."
On July 31, 2006, a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable, Time Warner NY Cable LLC ("TW NY"), acquired certain cable systems from Adelphia Communications Corporation, Comcast Corporation's ("Comcast") interests in Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. ("TWE") were redeemed, and
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
TW NY and Comcast also exchanged certain cable systems. Collectively, these acquisitions and dispositions are referred to as the "Transactions."
On January 1, 2007, Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. ("TKCCP"), an unconsolidated joint venture between Time Warner Cable and Comcast, distributed its assets to its partners. Time Warner Cable received the systems in Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico (the "Kansas City Pool"), which had approximately 855,000 customer relationships, including approximately 788,000 basic video subscribers, at December 31, 2006, and began consolidating the financial results of the Kansas City Pool on January 1, 2007.
For the presentation of subscriber information, the systems that the Company acquired in the Transactions, which had approximately 4.1 million customer relationships, including approximately 3.7 million basic video subscribers, at December 31, 2007, are referred to as the "Acquired Systems." Those systems that the Company owned both before and after the Transactions as well as the Kansas City Pool, which together had approximately 10.5 million customer relationships, including approximately 9.5 million basic video subscribers, at December 31, 2007, are referred to as the "Legacy Systems."
For the presentation of financial information, however, "Legacy Systems" refers only to those systems that the Company owned both before and after the Transactions and does not include the Kansas City Pool (the financial results of which the Company has shown separately). The "Acquired Systems" has the same definition as above.
The pro forma financial information for 2006 presents the results as if the Transactions had occurred and the Kansas City Pool had been consolidated on January 1, 2006.
As previously noted, on July 31, 2006, Time Warner Cable completed the Transactions and began consolidating the results of the Acquired Systems. Additionally, on January 1, 2007, the Company began consolidating the results of the Kansas City Pool. Accordingly, the operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007, include the results for the Legacy Systems, the Acquired Systems and the Kansas City Pool for the full three- and twelve-month periods, and the operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, include the results of the Legacy Systems for the full three- and twelve-month periods and the Acquired Systems for the three- and five-month periods ended December 31, 2006, but do not include the consolidation of the results of the Kansas City Pool. The impact of the incremental seven months of revenues and expenses of the Acquired Systems on the results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, is referred to as the "impact of the Acquired Systems" in the discussion that follows.
rose 36% ($4.2 billion) to $16.0 billion. The year-over-year increase reflects the impact of the Acquired Systems, 9% growth in the Legacy Systems and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($877 million).
FULL-YEAR RESULTS Revenues
Subscription revenues increased 36% ($4.0 billion) to $15.1 billion. Video revenues grew 33% ($2.5 billion) to $10.2 billion, benefiting from the impact of the Acquired Systems and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($547 million), as well as the continued penetration of digital video services and video price increases. High-speed data revenues rose 35% ($974 million) to $3.7 billion, driven mainly by the impact of the Acquired Systems and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($203 million), as well as subscriber growth. Voice revenues climbed 67% ($478 million) to $1.2 billion, resulting primarily from strong Digital Phone subscriber growth and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($85 million).
Advertising revenues increased 31% ($203 million) to $867 million, due mainly to the impact of the Acquired Systems, and, to a lesser extent, the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($42 million).
("OIBDA") climbed 36% ($1.5 billion) to $5.7 billion, reflecting revenue growth, offset partially by higher operating expenses, primarily video programming, employee, Digital Phone service and marketing costs. OIBDA also included merger-related and restructuring charges of $23 million in 2007, compared to $56 million in 2006.
Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
 
climbed 27% ($587 million) to $2.8 billion, reflecting the increase in OIBDA, offset partly by higher depreciation ($821 million) and amortization ($105 million) expenses. The increase in depreciation expense was due primarily to the impact of the Acquired Systems, the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool and an increase in recent years in demand-driven purchases of customer premise equipment, which generally has a shorter useful life compared to the mix of assets previously purchased. The increase in amortization expense was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets related to customer relationships associated with the Acquired Systems. This was offset partially by the absence after the first quarter of 2007 of amortization expense associated with customer relationships recorded in connection with the restructuring of TWE in 2003, which were fully amortized at the end of the first quarter of 2007.
Operating Income
For the full year 2007, income from continuing operations and net income were both $1.1 billion, or $1.15 per basic and diluted common share. This compares to income from continuing operations for the full year 2006 of $936 million, or $0.95 per basic and diluted common share, and net income for the full year 2006 of $2.0 billion, or $2.00 per basic and diluted common share.
Income and Per Share Results
Certain items in the full year 2007 affected comparability, including a gain resulting from the distribution of TKCCP's assets, which was treated as a sale of the Company's 50% equity interest in the Houston area systems of TKCCP. This item had the net effect of increasing the current year's income from continuing operations and net income by approximately $81 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted common share. Additionally, certain items in the prior year affected comparability, including a pretax gain on the systems transferred to Comcast in the Transactions and a net tax benefit resulting primarily from the reversal of historical deferred tax liabilities that had existed on systems transferred to Comcast, which were included in discontinued operations, net. In the aggregate, these items had the net effect of increasing the prior year's net income by approximately $965 million, or $0.97 per basic and diluted common share. Excluding these items, both income from continuing operations and net income increased for the full year 2007, due primarily to increases in Operating Income, offset in part by higher interest expense and higher income tax provision, as well as lower income from equity investments, net.
totaled $4.6 billion in 2007.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
increased $715 million to $3.4 billion. The growth in capital expenditures was driven by the Acquired Systems, as well as the continued roll-out of advanced digital services in the Legacy Systems.
Capital Expenditures from Continuing Operations
was $1.1 billion in 2007. Net debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred membership units as of December 31, 2007, totaled $13.6 billion.
Free Cash Flow
rose 12% ($438 million) to $4.1 billion. grew 19% ($254 million) to $1.6 billion. OIBDA also included merger-related and restructuring charges of $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. increased 26% ($162 million) to $795 million, as growth in OIBDA was offset partly by higher depreciation expense ($101 million).
FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS Revenues

OIBDA is a financial measure not calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company defines OIBDA as Operating Income before depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets. Management utilizes OIBDA, among other measures, in evaluating the performance of the Company's business because OIBDA eliminates the uneven effect across its business of considerable amounts of depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, management utilizes OIBDA because it believes this measure provides valuable insight into the underlying performance of the Company's individual cable systems by removing the effects of items that are not within the control of local personnel charged with managing these systems such as income tax provision, other income (expense), net, minority interest expense, net, income from equity investments, net, and interest expense, net. In this regard, OIBDA is a significant measure used in the Company's annual incentive compensation programs. OIBDA also is a metric used by the Company's parent, Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner"), to evaluate the Company's performance and is an important measure in the Time Warner reportable segment disclosures. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's business. To compensate for this limitation, management evaluates the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budget variances, investment spending levels and return on capital analyses. Another limitation of this measure is that it does not reflect the significant costs borne by the Company for income taxes, debt servicing costs, the share of OIBDA related to the minority ownership, the results of the Company's equity investments or other non-operational income or expense. Management compensates for this limitation through other financial measures such as a review of net income and earnings per share.
Use of OIBDA and Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities (as defined under GAAP) plus excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, less cash provided by (used by) discontinued operations, capital expenditures, partnership distributions and principal payments on capital leases. Management uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate the Company's business. The Company believes this measure is an important indicator of its liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt and make strategic investments, because it reflects the Company's operating cash flow after considering the significant capital expenditures required to operate its business. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect payments made in connection with investments and acquisitions, which reduce liquidity. To compensate for this limitation, management evaluates such expenditures through other financial measures such as return on investment analyses.
Both OIBDA and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's Operating Income, net income and various cash flow measures (e.g., cash provided by operating activities), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company uses pro forma information to evaluate its financial performance when certain acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions occur. Historical information reflects the Company's financial results only after the acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions have occurred, while pro forma information enhances comparability of financial information between periods by presenting the information as if the transactions had occurred at the beginning of the prior year. The pro forma information is adjusted for only the timing of the transactions and does not reflect the actions undertaken by management in integrating the applicable businesses or the financial or operational benefits that have been or may be realized as a result of the transactions.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
     On July 31, 2006, a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), Time Warner NY Cable LLC ("TW NY"), and Comcast Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "Comcast") completed the acquisition of substantially all of the cable assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation (the "Adelphia Acquisition"), Comcast's interests in TWC and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. were redeemed (the "Redemptions"), and TW NY and Comcast exchanged certain cable systems (the "Exchange" and, together with the Adelphia Acquisition and the Redemptions, the "Transactions"). The cable systems transferred to Comcast in connection with the Redemptions and the Exchange (the "Transferred Systems"), including gains recognized on the transfers, have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
     As previously disclosed, Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. ("TKCCP") was a 50-50 joint venture between a consolidated subsidiary of TWC (Time Warner Entertainment-Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("TWE-A/N")) and Comcast. On January 1, 2007, TKCCP distributed its assets to its partners. TWC received certain cable assets located in Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico (the "Kansas City Pool"), which served 788,000 basic video subscribers as of December 31, 2006, and Comcast received the pool of assets consisting of the Houston cable systems (the "Houston Pool"), which served 795,000 basic video subscribers as of December 31, 2006. TWC began consolidating the results of the Kansas City Pool on January 1, 2007. TKCCP was formally dissolved on May 15, 2007. For accounting purposes, TWC has treated the distribution of TKCCP's assets as a sale of TWC's 50% equity interest in the Houston Pool and as an acquisition of Comcast's 50% equity interest in the Kansas City Pool. As a result of the sale of TWC's 50% equity interest in the Houston Pool, TWC recorded a pretax gain of $146 million in the first quarter of 2007, which is included as a component of other income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.
     Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year's financial information to conform to the December 31, 2007 presentation.
