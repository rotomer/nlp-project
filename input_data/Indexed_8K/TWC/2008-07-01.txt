Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 30, 2008, Time Warner Cable Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "TWC"), entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the "Bridge Credit Agreement") among the Company, as borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Fortis Bank SA/NV New York Branch, as Tranche I Co-Syndication Agents, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as Tranche I Co-Documentation Agents, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and RBS Greenwich Capital, as Tranche I Joint-Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. New York Branch and Citibank, N.A., as Tranche II Co-Syndication Agents, Bank of America, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Tranche II Co-Documentation Agents, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. New York Branch, as Tranche II Joint-Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, for a $9.0 billion term loan facility with an initial maturity date that is 364 days after the borrowing date (the "Term Facility"). The Company may elect to extend the maturity date of the loans outstanding under the Term Facility for an additional year.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Term Facility to fund, in part, a special cash dividend payable pro rata to all holders of the Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock. TWC has not borrowed any amounts under the Term Facility. The special cash dividend is expected to be paid prior to the Company's separation from Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner") (the "Separation").
Subject to certain limited exceptions, to the extent TWC incurs debt (other than incurrence of debt under its existing $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and existing commercial paper program), issues equity securities or completes asset sales prior to drawing on the Term Facility, the commitments of the lenders (the "Lenders") under the Term Facility are reduced by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from any such incurrence, issuance or sale. As previously reported, on June 19, 2008, the Company issued $5.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and debentures (the "Debt Offering"). As a result of the Debt Offering, immediately after the Credit Agreement was executed, the amount of the commitments under the Term Facility was reduced to $4.04 billion. In the event TWC borrows any amounts under the Term Facility, subject to certain limited exceptions, TWC is required to use the net cash proceeds from any subsequent incurrence of debt (other than an incurrence under its existing $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and existing commercial paper program), issuance of equity securities and asset sale to prepay amounts outstanding under the Term Facility.
The Company's obligations under the Term Facility are guaranteed by its subsidiaries, Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. and TW NY Cable Holding Inc. Amounts outstanding under the Term Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the Company's credit rating, which margin, at the time of the Separation, is expected to be 100 basis points. In addition, the interest rate under the Term Facility will
 
increase every six months until all amounts outstanding under the Term Facility are repaid.
The Term Facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant of five times the consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Bridge Credit Agreement) of TWC. The Term Facility also contains conditions, covenants, representations and warranties and events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable) substantially identical to the conditions, covenants, representations and warranties and events of default in TWC's existing $3.045 billion five-year term loan facility due February 21, 2011. If any events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, the maturity of the borrowings outstanding may be accelerated.
The Lenders' commitments to fund borrowings under the Term Facility are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions related to the completion of the Separation and certain other customary conditions. The Lenders' commitments will expire on the earliest of (i) May 19, 2009, (ii) the date on which the agreement governing the Separation is terminated in accordance with its terms or (iii) the completion of the Separation.
The Lenders or their affiliates have performed commercial and investment banking and advisory services for the Company and its affiliates from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses. The Lenders may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for the Company in the ordinary course of their business. Certain of the Lenders or their affiliates are acting as financial advisors to the Company or Time Warner on the Separation, for which they will receive fees under agreements they have entered into with the Company or Time Warner, as the case may be.
As previously reported, TWC has also received a commitment from Time Warner pursuant to which Time Warner will provide it with a $3.5 billion two-year senior unsecured supplemental term loan facility to repay amounts outstanding under the Term Facility upon the maturity of the Term Facility (the "Supplemental Facility"). As a result of the Debt Offering, the commitment from Time Warner was reduced by approximately $980 million to approximately $2.52 billion. The Supplemental Facility will be documented under a credit agreement substantially identical to the Bridge Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Term Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bridge Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the Borrowing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting on the Borrowing Date the amounts so received, in like funds, (i) in the case of a Distribution to be achieved by a Spin-off alone, to an account as specified on Schedule 2.03(B) or otherwise appropriately designated by the Borrower in the Borrowing Request, or (ii) in the case of a Distribution to be achieved by a Split-off, including a Split-off to be followed by a Clean-up Spin-off, to the account specified in the Escrow Agreement, which Escrow Agreement shall have been executed and delivered on or prior to the Borrowing Date.

          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Borrowing Date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of any Borrowing under a Tranche, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the

     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".

          (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, as the case may be, having a one month Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided above.
          (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon the Initial Maturity Date and, if the Borrower elects the Maturity Extension as set forth in Section 2.09(b) with respect to the Tranche I Term Loans, the Extended Maturity Date.

          (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for actual days elapsed, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year). The Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate and LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Alternate Rate of Interest

     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate; or
     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and any such Borrowing referred to in such Interest Election Request shall, unless repaid by the Borrower, be converted to (as of the last day of the then current Interest Period), or maintained as, an ABR Borrowing, as the case may be (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and (ii) if the Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall, unless otherwise rescinded by the Borrower, be made as an ABR Loan (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect fewer than all Types of Borrowings, then the other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted.
          SECTION 2.14. . (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
     (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs actually incurred or reduction actually suffered.
          (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts
 
33
as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction actually suffered in respect of the Loans made by such Lender hereunder.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions unless a Lender gives notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to pay an amount under this Section within six months after the later of (i) the date the Lender incurs such increased costs, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital or (ii) the date such Lender has actual knowledge of its incurrence of such increased cost, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

provided
further
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.14, no Lender shall demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction referred to above if it shall not be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any (it being understood that this sentence shall not in any way limit the discretion of any Lender to waive the right to demand such compensation in any given case).
          SECTION 2.15. . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(c) and is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to be the amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit in Dollars equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest

rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits in Dollars from other banks in the Eurodollar market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          SECTION 2.16. . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes
provided
          (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section unless such amounts have been included in any amount paid pursuant to the proviso to Section 2.16(a)) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (c) If a Lender or the Administrative Agent receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund, as determined by such Lender in its reasonable discretion), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that the Borrower, upon the request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
provided
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
 
35
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
          (f) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a statement signed by an authorized signatory of the Lender that it is a U.S. Person and, if necessary to avoid United States backup withholding, a duly completed and signed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form) establishing that such Lender is organized under the laws of the United States and is not subject to United States backup withholding.
          (g) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require any Lender to disclose any confidential information regarding its tax returns or affairs.
          SECTION 2.17. . (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date shall, unless the Administrative Agent is able to distribute such amounts to the applicable Lenders on such date, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent in New York at the offices for the Administrative Agent set forth in Section 9.01, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient in like funds promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder, whether such payments are made in respect of principal, interest or fees or other amounts payable hereunder, shall be made in Dollars. All payments and reductions in Commitments in respect of a Tranche shall be applied pro-rata to the Lenders under such Tranche in accordance with their Tranche I Term Percentages or Tranche II Term Percentages, as the case may be.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs
          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal, then due
 
36
from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon owing by the Borrower than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders owing from the Borrower to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender from or on behalf of any Credit Party or otherwise in respect of the Obligations to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
          SECTION 2.18. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
 
37
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will be made to a Lender reasonably expected to result in a reduction in the compensation or payments to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to such sections. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

          Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Company or Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Credit Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders) and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative
 
53
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Article VII and Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under any Credit Document or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Credit Documents or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by a proper Person. An initial list of the proper Persons with respect to the Borrower appears on Schedule 8. Schedule 8 shall not be altered except in writing by a Person appearing thereon (or by a successor to such Person occupying the equivalent office). The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon so long as such statement, in the case of a Borrowing Request, complies with the requirements of Section 2.03 in all material respects (it being understood that oral notices of borrowing will be confirmed in writing by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.03). In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Credit Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
54
          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor which, so long as no Event of Default is continuing, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor; that the predecessor Administrative Agent shall pay the unearned portion of any fees paid in advance to either the successor Administrative Agent or the Borrower. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
provided
          The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their Applicable Percentage on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Article VIII (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Applicable Percentage immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
provided
          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
 
55
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
          The Co-Syndication Agents and Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities under any Credit Document in their capacity as such.

Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.
          (b) THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the "") have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower's or the Administrative Agent's transmission of Borrower Materials through the Platform, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent
Agent Parties
 
56
jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; , however, that (i) nothing in this clause (b) shall modify the Agent Parties' respective obligations pursuant to Section 9.12, and (ii) in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to any Lender for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).
provided
          SECTION 9.02. . (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments
          (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan (other than the Maturity Extension as contemplated by Section 2.09(b) (as in effect on the date hereof)), or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) amend, waive, modify or otherwise change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release either Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee without the written consent of each Lender; that if any of the events specified in Section 9.14 occur with respect to a Guarantor then the Guarantee shall be automatically released with respect to such Guarantor without any further action or (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and (ii) continue to be subject to the confidentiality provisions hereof). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Lender hereunder without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this Section.

No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
          (e) Any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.

The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
Survival
          SECTION 9.06. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
          SECTION 9.07. . Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Severability

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender that is primarily engaged in commercial banking activities and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
Right of Setoff

          (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.

          WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Lenders to make their respective Loans to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement that the Guarantors shall have executed and delivered this Guarantee to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders; and

          1. . (a) Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement.
Defined Terms
 
          (b) As used herein, "Obligations" means the collective reference to the unpaid principal of and interest on the Loans and all other obligations and liabilities of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (including, without limitation, interest accruing at the then applicable rate provided in the Credit Agreement after the maturity of the Loans and interest accruing at the then applicable rate provided in the Credit Agreement after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy, or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like proceeding, relating to the Borrower whether or not a claim for post-filing or post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, or now existing or hereafter incurred, which may arise under, out of, or in connection with, the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, in each case whether on account of principal, interest, reimbursement obligations, fees, indemnities, costs, expenses or otherwise (including, without limitation, all fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent or to the Lenders that are required to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document).
          (c) The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Guarantee shall refer to this Guarantee as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Guarantee, and section and paragraph references are to this Guarantee unless otherwise specified.
          (d) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms.
          2. . (a) Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Borrower as and when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations.
Guarantee
          (b) This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations are paid in full.
          (c) Each Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability hereunder, it will notify the Administrative Agent and such Lender in writing that such payment is made under this Guarantee for such purpose.
          (d) Anything herein or in any other Credit Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors.
          (e) No payment or payments made by the Borrower, either of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower, either of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any
 
Guarantor hereunder who shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or payments received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations, up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full.
          3. . Each Guarantor hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held by such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender that is primarily engaged in commercial banking activities and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify the applicable Guarantor promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
Right of Setoff

Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights

When making a demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor.
