     On March 26, 2009, Time Warner Cable Inc. (the "Company") completed its offering of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $1.0 billion principal amount of 7/% notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $2.0 billion principal amount of 8/% notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes" and, together with the 2014 Notes, the "Debt Securities") (the "March 2009 Offering"). The Debt Securities are guaranteed by Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. and TW NY Cable Holding Inc., each a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Guarantors").

The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, covenants and indemnification provisions. The offering of the Debt Securities was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-151671) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on June 16, 2008.

     The Debt Securities were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2007, as amended and supplemented (the "Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The Indenture was previously described in, and included as an exhibit to, the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 4, 2007, which was filed with the Commission on April 9, 2007.
     The 2014 Notes will mature on April 1, 2014 and the 2019 Notes will mature on April 1, 2019. The 2014 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 7/% per year and the 2019 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 8/% per year. Interest on the 2014 Notes and the 2019 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2009.

     The Debt Securities may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at the Company's option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Debt Securities being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the Debt Securities discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a government treasury rate plus 50 basis points for each of the 2014 Notes and the 2019 Notes as further described in the Indenture and the Debt Securities, plus, in each case, accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date.
     The Indenture contains customary covenants relating to restrictions on the ability of the Company or any material subsidiary to create liens and on the ability of the Company and the Guarantors to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets. The Indenture also contains customary events of default. The forms of the Debt Securities are attached as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to this Report and are incorporated by reference into this Report and the Registration Statement.
 
     Certain of the Underwriters or their affiliates have performed and may, from time to time in the future, engage in transactions with or perform commercial and investment banking and advisory services for the Company and its affiliates and/or are lenders under the Company's bank credit facilities, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
     The Company used $1.934 billion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Debt Securities to repay all of the borrowings outstanding and all other amounts due under the 2008 Bridge Facility (defined below), which the Company used to fund, in part, a special cash dividend paid on March 12, 2009 to the Company's stockholders of record on March 11, 2009 (the "Special Dividend"). The Company used the net proceeds in excess of $1.934 billion to repay borrowings outstanding under its $6.0 billion senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility.
     On June 30, 2008, the Company, as borrower, entered into a 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility (the "2008 Bridge Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 billion with the lenders from time to time party thereto, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Fortis Bank SA/NV New York Branch, as Tranche I co-syndication agents, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as Tranche I co-documentation agents, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and RBS Greenwich Capital, as Tranche I joint-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. New York Branch and Citibank, N.A., as Tranche II co-syndication agents, Bank of America, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Tranche II co-documentation agents, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. New York Branch, as Tranche II joint-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, in order to finance, in part, the Special Dividend. As a result of the Company's public debt offerings in June 2008 and November 2008, in which the Company issued, in total, $7.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and debentures, and an amendment on March 2, 2009 to the 2008 Bridge Facility to terminate Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank's $138 million commitment thereunder, commitments under the 2008 Bridge Facility were reduced to $1.932 billion. On March 12, 2009, the Company borrowed the full committed amount of $1.932 billion under the 2008 Bridge Facility in order to fund, in part, the Special Dividend. As described in Item 1.01 above, on March 26, 2009, the Company used $1.934 billion of the net proceeds from the March 2009 Offering to repay all of the borrowings outstanding and all other amounts due under the 2008 Bridge Facility and such facility was terminated by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. No early termination fees were incurred by the Company in connection with such termination.
     Certain of the lenders under the 2008 Bridge Facility or their affiliates have performed and may, from time to time in the future, engage in transactions with or perform commercial and investment banking and advisory services for the Company and its affiliates and/or are lenders under the Company's bank credit facilities, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
     On December 10, 2008, the Company (as borrower) and Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner") (as lender) entered into a $1.535 billion credit agreement (the "Supplemental Credit Agreement") for a two-year senior unsecured supplemental term loan facility (the "Supplemental Credit Facility") under which the Company was permitted to borrow only to repay amounts outstanding at the final maturity of the 2008 Bridge Facility, if any. As a result of the March 2009 Offering and the termination of the 2008 Bridge Facility, on March 26, 2009, the Company terminated Time Warner's commitments under the Supplemental Credit Facility, and the Supplemental Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms. No early termination fees were incurred by the Company in connection with such termination.
     Prior to the legal and structural separation of the Company from Time Warner on March 12, 2009, the financial results of the Company's operations were consolidated by Time Warner.

Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. Each of the Company, TW NY and TWE acknowledges that (i) the statements set forth in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and Final Prospectus in (1) the last paragraph of the cover page regarding the delivery of the
 
17
Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (2) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (3) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (4) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (ii) any information expressly furnished by the Underwriters for inclusion in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus appearing on Schedule IV, which Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses shall not include the final term sheets, the form of which appears in Schedule III.

The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including separate local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action or actions), (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action)
provided
however
 
18
unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any claim, action, suit or proceeding affected, without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, TW NY, TWE and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, TW NY and TWE on one hand, and by the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, TW NY, TWE and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, TW NY or TWE on the one hand, or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company, TW NY or TWE within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company, TW NY or TWE and each director of the Company, TW NY or TWE
provided
however
 
19
shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
          8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions for each of the Debt Securities which such Underwriter failed to purchase which the principal amount of the Debt Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Debt Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company and the Guarantors. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives and the Company shall determine in order that the required changes in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Guarantors and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

     The Guarantees constitute guarantees of payment, performance and compliance and not merely of collection. The obligation of the Guarantors to make any payments may be satisfied by causing the Company or any other Person to make such payments.

     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date for the Notes: (1) the average of two Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of four of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations; or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all quotations obtained by the Trustee.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, to be appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means four primary U.S. Government securities dealers to be selected by the Company.

     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; , , , if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note , the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.
provided
however
that
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date for the Notes: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded
 
4
United States Treasury debt securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; if no maturity is within three months before or after the maturity date for the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if that release, or any successor release, is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
provided that
     On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with a paying agent, or the Trustee, money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on such date. If the Company elects to redeem less than all of the Notes of a series, then the Trustee will select the particular Notes of such series to be redeemed by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
     If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes and all accrued interest thereon may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into supplemental indentures to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding of all Series to be affected thereby (acting as one class). The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding of each series on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of such series to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults and their consequences with respect to such series under the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note. The
 
5
Indenture also permits the release of a Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee in certain circumstances without the consent of the Holders of the Debt Securities.

     As provided in the Indenture and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions therein set forth, including the deposit of certain trust funds in trust, at the Company's option, either (i) the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by, and the obligations under, the Debt Securities of any series and to have satisfied all the obligations (with certain exceptions) under the Indenture relating to the Debt Securities and the Guarantees of such series or (ii) the Company and the Guarantors shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with any term, provision or condition of certain restrictive covenants or provisions set forth in any additions or changes to or deletions from covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Debt Securities and the Guarantees of such series.

          "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; , , , if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note , the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.

4
United States Treasury debt securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; if no maturity is within three months before or after the maturity date for the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if that release, or any successor release, is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
