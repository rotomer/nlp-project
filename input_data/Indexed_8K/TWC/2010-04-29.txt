Exhibit 99.1
Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE: TWC) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
NEW YORK, NY, April 29, 2010 
Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt said: "We're off to a great start in 2010. Through product enhancements, more effective marketing and cost management, we drove profitable first-quarter growth even in the face of more intense competition."
"We also paid our first regular dividend and reduced our leverage to our target on the timetable we promised more than a year ago. Our accomplishments in the first quarter demonstrate our commitment to providing innovative and increasingly valuable services to our customers, generating free cash flow and making smart capital allocation decisions to provide attractive returns for our shareholders."
FINANCIAL RESULTS
for the first quarter of 2010 increased 5.4% from the first quarter of 2009 to $4.6 billion. Subscription revenues grew 4.9% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, driven by a 4.1% increase in residential subscription revenues and a 19.2% increase in commercial subscription revenues. Advertising revenues increased 19.3% to $173 million. Residential subscription revenue growth was driven by increases in video, high-speed data and voice revenues. The growth in residential video revenues was the result of video price increases, the continued growth of digital video subscribers, and an increase in DVR service revenues, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in video subscribers. Residential high-speed data revenues increased as a result of growth in high-speed data subscribers and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The growth in residential voice revenues was driven by an increase in Digital Phone subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in average monthly revenues per Digital Phone subscriber. Commercial subscription revenue growth was due primarily to increases in Business Class Phone and commercial high-speed data subscribers and an increase in cell tower backhaul and Metro Ethernet revenues. Advertising revenue growth was driven by year-over-year increases in a wide range of categories, most significantly automotive.
Revenues
 
rose 10.9% over the first quarter of 2009 to $1.7 billion. The increase was driven by revenue growth, partially offset by a 2.5% increase in operating expenses. In particular, video programming expenses grew 5.1% to $1.1 billion, marketing expense was up 7.9% to $151 million, and voice costs increased 6.6% to $162 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, which declined 60.5% to $17 million. Video programming expenses increased due to contractual rate increases and incremental retransmission consent expense offset, in part, by a decline in video and premium channel subscriptions. Bad debt expense declined primarily due to improvements in collection efforts and the quality of residential receivables. was up 18.7% over the first quarter of 2009 to $850 million primarily as a result of higher Adjusted OIBDA and a decline in restructuring costs, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted OIBDA")
Operating Income
Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter of 2010 excludes the expenses noted in the table below.
for the first three months of 2010 totaled $935 million, a 26.7% increase over the first three months of 2009, due to higher Adjusted OIBDA and lower capital expenditures. were $736 million in the first three months of 2010, a 4.3% decrease from the first three months of 2009, largely reflecting lower residential capital spending, partly offset by higher commercial capital spending. The decline in residential capital spending was primarily attributable to lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher scalable infrastructure spending.

1.  ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY
     The following items affected the comparability of net income attributable to TWC shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009:
 
2.  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
     In discussing its performance, the Company may use certain measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These measures include OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA less Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow, which the Company defines as follows:
 
     Management uses OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA, among other measures, in evaluating the performance of the Company's business because they eliminate the effects of (1) considerable amounts of noncash depreciation and amortization and (2) items not within the control of the Company's operations managers (such as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), net, and interest expense, net). Adjusted OIBDA further eliminates the effects of certain noncash items identified in the definition of Adjusted OIBDA above. Adjusted OIBDA less Capital Expenditures also allows management to evaluate performance including the effect of capital spending decisions. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA less Capital Expenditures are also significant performance measures used in the Company's annual incentive compensation programs. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is an important indicator of the Company's liquidity after the payment of cash taxes, interest and other cash items, including its ability to reduce net debt, pay dividends and make strategic investments. In addition, all of these measures are commonly used by analysts, investors and others in evaluating the Company's performance and liquidity.
     These measures have inherent limitations. For example, OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA do not reflect capital expenditures or the periodic costs of certain capitalized assets used in generating revenues. To compensate for such limitations, management evaluates performance through Adjusted OIBDA less Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow, which reflect capital expenditures, and net income (loss) attributable to TWC shareholders, which reflects the periodic costs of capitalized assets. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA less Capital Expenditures do not reflect any of the items noted as exclusions in the definition of Adjusted OIBDA above. To compensate for these limitations, management evaluates performance through OIBDA and net income (loss) attributable to TWC shareholders, which do reflect such items. OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA less Capital Expenditures also fail to reflect the significant costs borne by the Company for income taxes and debt servicing costs, the share of OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA less Capital Expenditures attributable to noncontrolling interests, the results of the Company's equity investments or other non-operational income or expense. Management compensates for these limitations by using other analytics such as a review of net income (loss) attributable to TWC shareholders. Free Cash Flow, a liquidity measure, does not reflect payments made in connection with investments and acquisitions, which reduce liquidity. To compensate for this limitation, management evaluates such investments and acquisitions through other measures such as return on investment analyses.
     These measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, the Company's Operating Income (Loss), net income (loss) attributable to TWC shareholders and various cash flow measures (e.g., cash provided by operating activities), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
