On December 2, 2010, Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (TWE), a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable Inc. (the Company), renewed its employment agreement with Marc Lawrence-Apfelbaum, which extends the term of Mr. Lawrence-Apfelbaums employment as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company through December 31, 2013 on the same terms as the employment agreement between TWE and Mr. Lawrence-Apfelbaum dated June 1, 2000, as amended (the Employment Agreement).  Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, the failure by either TWE or Mr. Lawrence-Apfelbaum to extend the term of the Employment Agreement on the same terms and conditions for an additional year would have triggered the payment of severance benefits to Mr. Lawrence-Apfelbaum.
