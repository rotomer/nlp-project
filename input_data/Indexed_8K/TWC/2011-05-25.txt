provided
however
     (k) The Company agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus, other than the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(b) hereto or a Free Writing Prospectus that contains only the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering or information that is included in the Preliminary Final Prospectus or the final term sheet; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule IV hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company, as the case may be, is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
     (l) The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1).
     (m) The Company shall comply with the terms of any lock-up agreement specified in Schedule I hereto with respect to sales and dispositions of underwritten Securities.
     (n) In connection with the offering of the Securities, until the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters shall have notified the Company of the completion of the resale of the Securities, neither the Company nor any of its controlled subsidiaries has or will, either alone or with one or more other persons, bid for or purchase, for any account in which it or any of its controlled
 
subsidiaries has a beneficial interest, any Securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any Securities; and neither it nor any of its controlled subsidiaries will make bids or purchases for the purpose of creating actual, or apparent, active trading in, or of raising the price of, the Securities.

     (p) The Company and the Guarantors hereby authorize Barclays Bank PLC in its role as stabilizing manager (the "Stabilizing Manager") to make adequate public disclosure regarding stabilization of the information required in relation to such stabilization by Commission Regulation (EC) 2273/2003. The Stabilizing Manager for its own account may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and directives, over-allot and effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Debt Securities at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail, but in doing so the Stabilizing Manager shall act as principal and not as agent of the Company and any loss resulting from over-allotment and stabilization shall be borne, and any profit arising therefrom shall be beneficially retained, by the Stabilizing Manager. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) will undertake any stabilization action. Nothing contained in this paragraph (p) shall be construed so as to require the Company to issue in excess of 625,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities. Such stabilization, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time and shall be conducted by the Stabilizing Manager in accordance with all applicable laws and directives.
          5. .

     (h) Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, subsequent to the Execution Time, (i) there shall not have been any downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Company's, TW NY's or TWE's debt securities by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, and (ii) none of the Company, TW NY or TWE shall have been placed under special surveillance, with negative implications, by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Group.

liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that none of the Company, TW NY or TWE will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company, TW NY or TWE by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company, TW NY or TWE may otherwise have.
provided
however
          (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company, TW NY and TWE, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers, and each person who controls the Company, TW NY and TWE within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company, TW NY and TWE to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company, TW NY and TWE by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. Each of the Company, TW NY and TWE acknowledges that (i) the statements set forth in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and Final Prospectus in (1) the last paragraph of the cover page regarding the delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (2) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (3) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (4) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (ii) any information expressly furnished by the Underwriters for inclusion in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus appearing on Schedule IV, which Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses shall not include the final term sheets, the form of which appears in Schedule III, is the only information provided to the Company by the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the first sentence of the Section 7(b).
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify
 
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including separate local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action or actions), (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any claim, action, suit or proceeding affected, without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
provided
however
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, TW NY, TWE and the Underwriters severally agree to
 
contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, TW NY and TWE on one hand, and by the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, TW NY, TWE and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, TW NY or TWE on the one hand, or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company, TW NY or TWE within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company, TW NY or TWE and each director of the Company, TW NY or TWE shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

          8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions for each of the Debt Securities which such Underwriter failed to purchase which the principal amount of the Debt Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Debt
Default by an Underwriter
 
Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company and the Guarantors. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives and the Company shall determine in order that the required changes in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Guarantors and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided

          9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock or any of the Company's, TW NY's or TWE's debt securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the NYSE or trading in securities generally on such exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices shall have been established on such exchange, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by such exchange or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any new outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except to the extent provided in Sections 4(i), 6 and 7.

SCHEDULE IV
 
EXHIBIT A
 
 
As Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, such counsel has reviewed and participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, including the documents that are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus. In examining the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, such counsel has necessarily assumed the correctness and completeness of the statements made or included therein by the Company and the Guarantors, including the documents incorporated by reference therein and take no responsibility therefor. However, in the course of the preparation by the Company and the Guarantors of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, such counsel has participated in conferences with certain officers of, and accountants for, the Company and the Guarantors with respect thereto, and such counsel's examination of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein and such counsel's participation in the above-mentioned conferences did not disclose any information which gave such counsel reason to believe that: (i) the Registration Statement (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference and each Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel expresses no such belief), at the time the Registration Statement became effective and at the Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) as of 10:50 AM (Eastern time) on May 19, 2011 (the "Applicable Time"), the Disclosure Package (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference, as to which such counsel expresses no such belief), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (iii) the Final Prospectus as of its date or at the Closing Date (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference, as to which such counsel expresses no such belief) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
EXHIBIT B
 
 
     As of the date of the opinions expressed above, a judgment for money in an action based on a Security denominated in a foreign currency or currency unit in a Federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of the foreign currency or currency unit in which a particular Security is denominated into United States dollars will depend on various factors, including which court renders the judgment. A state court in the State of New York rendering a judgment on such Security would be required under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law to render such judgment in the foreign currency in which the Security is denominated, and such judgment would be converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. A Federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the Securities would apply the foregoing New York law.
 
EXHIBIT C
In the course of acting as special counsel to the Company in connection with the offering of the Debt Securities, such counsel has participated in conferences and telephone conversations with officers and other representatives of the Company and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Based upon such participation (and relying as to factual matters on officers, employees and other representatives of the Company and its subsidiaries) and such counsel's understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience such counsel has gained in its practice thereunder, such counsel hereby advises you that its work in connection with this matter did not disclose any information that gave such counsel reason to believe that (i) at the time it became effective and the Execution Time, the Registration Statement (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference and each Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no such belief), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference, as to which such counsel expresses no such belief) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) as of its date and the date hereof, the Final Prospectus (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference, as to which such counsel expresses no such belief) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

In the event it is the chairman of the nominating and governance committee and each of the Independent Directors (as defined in the Certificate) who failed to receive a majority of votes cast, then (x) if the Board has designated a lead director, the lead director shall manage the process, and that Director shall have the authority otherwise delegated to the chairman of the nominating and governance committee by this Section 2 or (y) if the Board has not designated a lead director, the most senior Director (or Directors if such Directors are of equivalent seniority) shall manage the process, and that Director(s) shall have the authority otherwise delegated to the chairman of the nominating and governance committee by this Section 2. Any Director who tenders his or her offer of resignation as a result of a failure to receive a majority of votes cast shall not participate in the committee's or the Board's deliberations or vote on whether to accept or reject the resignation offer. Any vacancies in the Board resulting from the failed election of a director under this Section 2 may be filled pursuant to Article V, Section 4 of the Certificate.

Exhibit 5.1
Time Warner Cable Inc. 60 Columbus Circle New York, NY 10023
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as special counsel to Time Warner Cable Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), TW NY Cable Holding Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TW NY"), and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("TWE" and, together with TW NY, the "Guarantors"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-173760) (the "Registration Statement"), which became effective on April 28, 2011. You have asked us to furnish our opinion as to the legality of 625,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.750% Notes due 2031 (the "Notes"), including the guarantees endorsed thereon (the "Guarantees" and, together with the Notes, the "Securities"), which are registered under the Registration Statement and which are being sold today pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among the representatives named on Schedule I thereto, as representatives of the underwriters named on Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters"), the Company and the Guarantors.
          The Notes and the related Guarantees, are to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2007 (the "Base Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of April 9, 2007 (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee and
 
Time Warner Cable Inc.
pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Offering Committee of the Company on May 19, 2011, as authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.
          In connection with the furnishing of this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents:
          1. the Registration Statement;
          2. the preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 19, 2011;
          3. the pricing term sheet dated May 19, 2011 set forth on Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement;
          4. the final prospectus supplement dated May 19, 2011 (the "Final Prospectus");
          5. the Underwriting Agreement;
          6. the Indenture; and
          7. the form of Notes to be issued on the date of this letter (including the Guarantees.
          In addition, we have examined (i) such corporate or partnership records of the Company, TWE and TW NY that we have considered appropriate, including a copy of the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws, as amended of the Company, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as amended, of TW NY and the certificate of limited partnership, as amended or restated, and partnership agreement, as amended or restated, of TWE, each certified by the Company and each such Guarantor as in effect on the date of this letter, (ii) the organizational documents of the general partners of TWE and their direct or indirect general partners or managing or sole members (collectively, the "TWE General Partners"), (iii) copies of resolutions of the board of directors of the Company, the sole director of TW NY and the TWE General Partners relating to the issuance of the Notes, certified by the Company and such Guarantors, and (iv) such other certificates, agreements and documents as we deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
          We have also relied upon oral and written statements of officers and representatives of the Company, the representations and warranties of the Company made in the Underwriting Agreement as to factual matters and upon certificates of public officials and the officers of the Company.
          In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of
 
Time Warner Cable Inc.
all individuals who have executed any of the documents reviewed by us, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic, reproduced or conformed copies of valid existing agreements or other documents, the authenticity of all such latter documents and that the statements regarding matters of fact in the certificates, records, agreements, instruments and documents that we have examined are accurate and complete.
          Based upon the above, and subject to the stated assumptions, exceptions and qualifications, we are of the opinion that:
          1. The Notes, when duly authenticated by the Trustee, and duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that the enforceability of the Notes may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          2. When the Notes are duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantee of each Guarantor will be a valid and legally binding obligation of each such Guarantor, enforceable against each of the Guarantors in accordance with their terms, except that enforceability of the Guarantees may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          As of the date of the opinions expressed above, a judgment for money in an action based on a Security denominated in a foreign currency or currency unit in a Federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of the foreign currency or currency unit in which a particular Security is denominated into United States dollars will depend on various factors, including which court renders the judgment. A state court in the State of New York rendering a judgment on such Security would be required under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law to render such judgment in the foreign currency in which the Security is denominated, and such judgment would be converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. A Federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the Securities would apply the foregoing New York law.
          The opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership
 
Time Warner Cable Inc.
Act of the State of Delaware, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the federal laws of the United States of America. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to the laws, and the rules, regulations and orders under those laws, that are currently in effect.
          We hereby consent to use of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the base prospectus included in the Registration Statement and in the Final Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
