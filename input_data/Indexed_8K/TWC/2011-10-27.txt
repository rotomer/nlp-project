The Company would like to clarify statements made during the course of the conference call regarding October 2011 subscriber net additions as follows:
Its still early in the quarter, but in the first few weeks of October 2011, video and broadband net adds are in the same zone as a year ago, but voice nets adds continued to be weaker.
Statements made in response to a question later in the call were meant to refer to the year-ago period and not to the third quarter of 2011.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
