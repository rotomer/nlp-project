By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in the same Currency as such LC Disbursement by paying to the Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement; provided that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse the Issuing Bank on such date, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Base Rate Borrowing in the principal amount and Currency of the LC Disbursement, without regard to the minimum amounts and multiples set forth in Section 2.02, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Commitments and the TWEAN Sublimit. If the Borrower elects, or is deemed, to finance amounts due under any Letter of Credit in such a manner, the Borrower's obligation to pay an amount equal to the LC Disbursement to the Issuing Bank shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Base Rate Borrowing, and the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent, who shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement and corresponding Base Rate Borrowing and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Issuing Bank its Applicable Percentage of such Base Rate Borrowing, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders). Promptly following receipt of any payment from a Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, such payment shall be distributed to the Issuing Bank (and the participating Lenders as their interests may appear) or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to fund any Base Rate Loan made to reimburse the Issuing Bank, to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank (and the participating Lenders as their interests may appear) pro rata as their interests may appear. (f) Obligations Absolute. The applicable Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower's obligations hereunder, the respective Issuing Bank's only obligation to the applicable Borrower in respect of any drawing made on any Letter of Credit being to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and appear to substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Neither the Administrative Agent, nor any of the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to such Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by such Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with any of the foregoing circumstances. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Lenders and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and/or the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Loans in the applicable Currency; provided that, if such LC Disbursement cannot be reimbursed with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.05(e) and the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within three Business Days, then Section 2.12(g) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among AOLTW, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. AOLTW shall notify the Administrative Agent, who will notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the applicable Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. (j) Existing Letters of Credit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above in this Section 2.05, including, without limitation, the procedural requirements of clause (b) hereof, each letter of credit listed on Schedule 2.05 which is outstanding on the Effective Date (including any extension thereof) shall constitute a "Letter of Credit" for all purposes of this Agreement and shall be deemed issued, including for purposes of this Section 2.05 and Section 2.11(c), on the Effective Date. Thereafter, each such Letter of Credit deemed issued pursuant to this Section 2.05(j) shall be governed by, and shall be subject to the provisions of, this Section 2.05, and AOLTW and the respective Issuing Banks with respect to such Letters of Credit deemed issued pursuant to this Section 2.05 agree that any reimbursement agreement, credit agreement or other document (excluding such Letter of Credit itself) previously governing such Letter of Credit shall be deemed terminated and replaced with the provisions of this Section 2.05 and the other applicable terms of this Agreement (it being understood that any fees or other amounts payable to such Issuing Bank accrued prior to the Effective Date in respect of any such Letter of Credit, shall be payable to such Issuing Bank in accordance with the provisions of such prior agreement). SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time for the applicable Currency, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower specified on Schedule 2.03(B) or designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent shall have the right to demand payment from the applicable Lender and/or the applicable Borrower and they each severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (A) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, the Alternative Base Rate, and (B) in the case of Borrowings denominated in any Optional Currency, the interest rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent as the rate applicable to overnight settlements between banks for the amount advanced by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender or (ii) in the case of the applicable Borrower, the interest rate that would otherwise apply to such Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing and such payment shall absolve any obligation of the applicable Borrower in respect of any demand made under this Section in respect of such Loan. SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type (but of the same currency) or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may be made and maintained only as Base Rate Loans. (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election (as more specifically set forth in Schedule 2.03(A)). Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower. (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be a Base Rate Borrowing or a Eurocurrency or a TIBOR Borrowing; (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period". If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. All Loans denominated in Yen in each case shall be TIBOR Loans. (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, as the case may be, having a one month Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency and TIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date. (a) AOLTW may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $20,000,000 and (ii) AOLTW shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments. (b) AOLTW shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (a) of this Section at least one Business Day prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by AOLTW pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by AOLTW may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by AOLTW (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to such Borrower on the Maturity Date (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Yen Fronting Lender and the participating Lenders as their interests may appear the then unpaid principal amount of each Yen Loan owed by such Borrower on the Maturity Date and (iii) to the Administrative Agent the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan owed by such Borrower on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that a Revolving Borrowing is made by such Borrower. (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the applicable Borrowers. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section. (b) The Borrower that desires to make a prepayment shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of any prepayment hereunder in accordance with Schedule 2.03(A). Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to (i) a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof and (ii) a Swingline Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Swingline Lender of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing hereunder shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12. SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee (a "Facility Fee") which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the average daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the Maturity Date (or such earlier date after the Commitment Termination Date on which the Loans are repaid in full), commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (b) The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Commitments terminate and the Revolving Credit Exposures of all the Lenders are paid or extinguished in full, a utilization fee (a "Utilization Fee") which shall accrue, with respect to any day, (a) that the Commitment Utilization Percentage is greater than 33% but less than or equal to 66%, at the rate of 0.0625% per annum on such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure, and (b) that the Commitment Utilization Percentage is greater than 66%, at the rate of 0.125% per annum on such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued Utilization Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, on the Maturity Date and on any date thereafter on which the Revolving Credit Exposures of all the Lenders are paid or extinguished in full, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All Utilization Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (c) The applicable Borrower agrees to pay (i) to each Lender a letter of credit fee (a "Letter of Credit Fee") with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate for Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee (a "Fronting Fee"), which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum of the face amount of each Letter of Credit (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure. Letter of Credit Fees and Fronting Fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All Letter of Credit Fees and Fronting Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (d) The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between AOLTW and the Administrative Agent. (e) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of Facility Fees, Utilization Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and Fronting Fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto or, in the case of Fronting Fees, to the Issuing Bank. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances absent manifest error in the calculation and/or payment thereof. SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate. (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. (c) The Loans comprising each Pound Sterling Overnight Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Pound Sterling Overnight Rate. (d) The Loans comprising each Euro Overnight Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Euro Overnight Rate. (e) The Loans comprising each TIBOR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the TIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Rate. (f) The Loans comprising each Swingline Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of Swingline Loans denominated in Dollars, the Alternative Base Rate, (ii) in the case of Swingline Loans denominated in Pounds, the Pound Sterling Overnight Rate or the Pound Sterling Quoted Rate, as applicable, and (iii) in the case of Swingline Loans denominated in Euros, the Euro Overnight Rate or the Euro Quoted Rate, as applicable. (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to Loans in the Base Rate of the relevant Currency as provided above. (h) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon the Commitment Termination Date. (i) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and (ii) with respect to Loans denominated in Pounds, the interest rate thereon shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Base Rate, TIBOR Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate and LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing: (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the relevant Currency or the TIBOR Rate; or (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the relevant Currency or the TIBOR Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrowers and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing, as applicable, shall be ineffective and any such Borrowing referred to in such Interest Election Request shall, unless repaid by the applicable Borrower, be converted to (as of the last day of the then current Interest Period), or maintained as, a Base Rate Borrowing, as the case may be (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall, unless otherwise rescinded by the applicable Borrower, be made as a Base Rate Loan in the applicable Currency (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect fewer than all Types of Borrowings, then the other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted. SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market or the Tokyo interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs actually incurred or reduction actually suffered. (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of the Commitment or the Loans made by, or participation in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction actually suffered in respect of the Commitment or Loans made by, or participation in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender hereunder. (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrowers shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that the applicable Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions unless a Lender or the Issuing Bank gives notice to the applicable Borrowers that they are obligated to pay an amount under this Section within six months after the later of (i) the date the Lender or the Issuing Bank incurs such increased costs, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital or (ii) the date such Lender or the Issuing Bank has actual knowledge of its incurrence of such increased cost, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.14, no Lender nor Issuing Bank shall demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction referred to above if it shall not be the general policy or practice of such Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any (it being understood that this sentence shall not in any way limit the discretion of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to waive the right to demand such compensation in any given case). SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit in the applicable Currency equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the TIBOR Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits in the applicable Currency from other banks in the Eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of each Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if such Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable by such Borrower under this Section unless such amounts have been included in any amount paid pursuant to the proviso to Section 2.16(a)) paid by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) If a Lender or the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund, as determined by such Lender in its reasonable discretion), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant taxation authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Borrower, upon the request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such taxation authority. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (f) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to AOLTW (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a statement signed by an authorized signatory of the Lender that it is a U.S. Person and, if necessary to avoid United States backup withholding, a duly completed and signed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form) establishing that such Lender is organized under the laws of the United States and is not subject to United States backup withholding. (g) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require any Lender to disclose any confidential information regarding its tax returns or affairs. SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date shall, unless the Administrative Agent is able to distribute such amounts to the applicable Lenders on such date, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent (i) in New York, for payments in Dollars, (ii) in London, for payments in Euros or Pounds and (iii) in Tokyo, for payments in Yen, in each case, at the offices for the Administrative Agent set forth in Section 9.01, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein, and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient in like funds promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder, whether such payments are made in respect of principal, interest or fees, shall be made in the Currency in which the applicable payment obligation is due; provided, that payments in respect of Facility Fees pursuant to Section 2.11 and any other payments (not in respect of principal, interest or fees) or reimbursements shall be payable in Dollars. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due from any Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements, then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon owing by any Borrower than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders owing from such Borrower to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by such Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due from such Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, (i) if the relevant amount is denominated in Pounds Sterling, at the Pound Sterling Overnight Rate (ii) if the relevant amount is denominated in Dollars, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (iii) if the relevant amount is denominated in any other Currency, at the interest rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent as the rate applicable for overnight settlements between banks for the amount paid by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Borrower. (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender from or on behalf of any Credit Party or otherwise in respect of the Obligations to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Such Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender hereunder, then AOLTW may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) AOLTW shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank), which consent shall, in each case, not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will be made to a Lender reasonably expected to result in a reduction in the compensation or payments to be paid by the Borrowers pursuant to such sections. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling AOLTW to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. SECTION 2.19. Prepayments Required Due to Currency Fluctuation. (a) Not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter of AOLTW or at such other time as is reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (the "Calculation Time"), the Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Equivalent of the total Revolving Credit Exposures outstanding as of such date. (b) If at the Calculation Time, the Dollar Equivalent of the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the total Commitments then in effect by 5% or more, then within five Business Days of notice to the Borrowers thereof, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Swingline Loans or Revolving Loans or cash collateralize the outstanding Letters of Credit in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.19(b) shall be construed to require the Administrative Agent to calculate compliance under this Section 2.19(b) other than at the times set forth in Section 2.19(a). (c) If at the Calculation Time, the Dollar Equivalent of the total Yen Loans exceeds the total Yen Commitments then in effect by 5% or more, then within five Business Days of notice to the Borrowers thereof, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Yen Loans in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.19(c) shall be construed to require the Administrative Agent to calculate compliance under this Section 2.19(c) other than at the times set forth in Section 2.19(a). SECTION 2.20. Adoption of the Euro. Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro in any Participating Member State and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. Each obligation under this Agreement of a party to this Agreement which has been denominated in the National Currency Unit of a Subsequent Participant shall be redenominated into the Euro in accordance with EMU Legislation immediately upon such Subsequent Participant becoming a Participating Member State (but otherwise in accordance with EMU Legislation). If, in relation to the currency of any Subsequent Participant, the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to such currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such Subsequent Participant becomes a Participating Member State; provided, that if any Loan in the currency of such Subsequent Participant which is subject to an Interest Period is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period. SECTION 2.21. Termination of Certain Borrowers. AOLTW may elect by written notice to the Administrative Agent to terminate the status of TWE or TWEAN as a Borrower under the Facilities; provided that at the time of such election TWE or TWEAN, as the case may be, is not obligated in respect of any outstanding Loans (including, without limitation, any Swingline Loans) or any Letters of Credit under either of the Facilities. Upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice of termination, AOLTW may designate such terminated Borrower as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 6.08. Upon the termination of TWE or TWEAN, as the case may be, as a Borrower hereunder pursuant to this Section, any Guarantees of the Obligations of such Borrower shall terminate without any further action. ARTICLE III Representations and Warranties Each Borrower represents and warrants (as to itself and its Restricted Subsidiaries) to the Lenders that: SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each Credit Party and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

(a) There are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrowers, threatened against or affecting any Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) which could reasonably be expected to be adversely determined and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

All statements of fact and representation concerning the present business, operations and assets of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the Credit Documents and the transactions referred to therein are true and correct in all material respects. ARTICLE IV Conditions SECTION 4.01. Effective Date.

SECTION 5.03. Existence; Conduct of Business. Such Borrower will, and will cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries which are Material Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges and franchises material to the conduct of its business; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.04.

Such Borrower will, and will cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 6.03. Liens.

SECTION 6.08. Unrestricted Subsidiaries. (a) Schedule 6.08 sets forth those Subsidiaries that have been designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, which Subsidiaries do not include any Guarantor or a Borrower. A Borrower may designate any other of its Subsidiaries (other than a Borrower or a Guarantor) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries from time to time in compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.08. Such Borrower will not designate any of its Subsidiaries as an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless at the time such Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, before and after giving effect to such designation on a pro forma basis, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, as certified in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Administrative Agent at the time of such designation. Such Officers' Certificate also shall state the specific purpose for which such designation is being made. All Subsidiaries of Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall be Unrestricted Subsidiaries. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon designation by AOLTW of TWE or TWEAN as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with this Section 6.08 subsequent to termination of its status as a Borrower in accordance with Section 2.21, for purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, including the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.08, all representations and warranties, conditions, covenants and/or Defaults to the extent otherwise applicable to any such terminated Borrower but not applicable to all Unrestricted Subsidiaries generally, shall thereafter be deemed inapplicable with respect to such terminated Borrower until such time, if any, as such terminated Borrower shall subsequently be designated or redesignated a Restricted Subsidiary. (b) A Borrower may designate or re-designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary from time to time in compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.08. Such Borrower will not designate or re-designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, unless at the time such Unrestricted Subsidiary is so designated or re-designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, after giving effect to such designation or re-designation on a pro forma basis, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, as certified in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Administrative Agent at the time of such designation or re-designation.
ARTICLE VII Events of Default If any of the following events ("Events of Default") shall occur: (a) any Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the due date thereof or at a date fixed for prepayment thereof or otherwise; (b) any Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount (other than an amount referred to in clause (a) of this Article) payable under this Agreement, when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of five days; (c) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by or on behalf of any Credit Party in any Credit Document or any amendment or modification thereof, or in any report, certificate, financial statement or other document furnished pursuant to or in connection with any Credit Document or any amendment or modification thereof, shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed made;

(f) any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall fail to make any payment (whether of principal or interest and regardless of amount) in respect of any Material Indebtedness, when and as the same shall become due and payable after giving effect to any applicable grace periods; (g) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables or permits (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to cause any Material Indebtedness to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity; provided that this clause (g) shall not apply to secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness; (h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or other relief in respect of any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower or its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets, under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed for 60 days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered; (i) any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower shall (i) voluntarily commence any proceeding or file any petition seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, (ii) consent to the institution of, or fail to contest in a timely and appropriate manner, any proceeding or petition described in clause (h) of this Article, (iii) apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower or for a substantial part of its assets, (iv) file an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any such proceeding, (v) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (vi) take any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; (j) any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower shall become unable, admit in writing or fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; (k) one or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $200,000,000 shall be rendered against any Borrower, any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower or any combination thereof or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor (whose liquidated judgment, along with those of any other judgment creditor's, exceeds $200,000,000) to attach or levy upon any assets of any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower to enforce any such judgment, and the same shall remain undischarged for a period of 60 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, vacated or bonded pending appeal; (l) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, when taken together with all other ERISA Events (with respect to which a Borrower has a liability which has not yet been satisfied) that have occurred, could, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (m) except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, any of the Guarantees shall cease, for any reason, to be in full force and effect or any Credit Party shall so assert; or (n) a Change in Control shall occur; then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to a Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to AOLTW, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of any Borrower accrued hereunder (including all amounts of LC Exposure, whether or not the beneficiary of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required therein), shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower; and in case of any event with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of any Borrower accrued hereunder (including all amounts of LC Exposure, whether or not the beneficiary of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required therein), shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower. With respect to all Letters of Credit with respect to which presentment for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an acceleration pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Borrower shall at such time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, if any. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made in Cash Equivalents, or upon mutual consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, any other investment (in each case at the Borrowers' risk and expense), such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all reimbursement obligations shall have been satisfied and all other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and other the other Credit Documents shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to the Borrowers (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled thereto). ARTICLE VIII The Agents Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Company or Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Company that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by any Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under any Credit Document or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Credit Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by a proper Person. An initial list of the proper Persons with respect to the Borrowers appears on Schedule 8. Schedule 8 shall not be altered except in writing by a Person appearing thereon (or by a successor to such Person occupying the equivalent office). The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon so long as such statement, in the case of a Borrowing Request, complies with the requirements of Section 2.03 in all material respects (it being understood that oral notices of borrowing will be confirmed in writing by such Borrower in accordance with Section 2.03). The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor which, so long as no Event of Default is continuing, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), ratably according to their Commitments in effect (or at any time after the Commitments have terminated, their Revolving Credit Exposure) on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Commitments (or, if the Commitments have terminated earlier, their Revolving Credit Exposures) immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. The Co-Syndication Agents and Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in their capacity as such. ARTICLE IX Miscellaneous SECTION 9.01. Notices.

Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release any Guarantor under the Primary Guarantee without the written consent of each Lender, or (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) AOLTW shall, or shall cause the Borrowers to, pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Credit Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with any Credit Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof, it being understood that the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall use, and AOLTW shall only be required to pay such fees, charges and disbursements of, a single counsel, unless (and to the extent) conflicts of interests require the use of more than one counsel. (b) AOLTW shall, or shall cause the Borrowers to, indemnify each Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Credit Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of, or the proposed use of, the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by any Company, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to any Company, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. (c) To the extent that any of the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that no Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender except in accordance with Section 6.04 (and any attempted assignment or transfer by such Credit Party without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, each of AOLTW and the Administrative Agent and (a) the Swingline Lender (but only in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Commitment in respect of Swingline Exposure) or (b) the Issuing Bank (but only in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Commitment in respect of LC Exposure) must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining balance of the assigning Lender's Commitment, each assignment shall not be less than an aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000, (iii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining balance of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the remaining amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender after giving effect to such assignment shall not be less than $15,000,000 unless, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), each of AOLTW and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, (iv) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) except in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender on or about the Effective Date, the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee shall be sufficient to record an assignment under both Facilities), and (vi) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; provided further that any consent of AOLTW otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall (i) continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03) and (ii) continue to be subject to the confidentiality provisions hereof. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Lender hereunder without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this Section. (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (e) Any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers' prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) Each Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (g) above. (i) Each Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance. SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Lenders constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any of the Credit Parties (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all the obligations of any of the Credit Parties now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. (b) Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Credit Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. (c) Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, provided that in connection with any such requirement by a subpoena or similar legal process, AOLTW is given prior notice to the extent such prior notice is permissible under the circumstances and an opportunity to object to such disclosure, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an express agreement for the benefit of the Borrowers containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any (i) assignee (or Conduit Lender) of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee (or Conduit Lender) of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) hedging agreement counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's professional advisor), (g) with the consent of AOLTW or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from one or more of the Borrowers, whether oral or written, relating to the Borrowers or their business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by one or more of the Borrowers; provided that, in the case of information received from one or more of the Borrowers after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information, including in accordance with Regulation FD as promulgated by the SEC. SECTION 9.13. Acknowledgements. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that: (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents; (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, and the relationship between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Credit Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Borrowers and the Lenders. SECTION 9.14. Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under any other Credit Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each of the applicable Borrowers in respect of any such sum due from it to either the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally adjudged to be due to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the Agreement Currency (as converted on the date of final judgment), the Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally adjudged to be due to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrowers (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). The obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 9.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder. SECTION 9.15. Loans to Borrowers Separate Credit Facility. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) the Commitments being provided hereunder are set forth in a single agreement for convenience only, and the Loans and other extensions of credit to each of the Borrowers are to be considered by the parties hereto as being made under a separate credit facility for each Borrower and (b) the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement are several and not joint except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written. AOL TIME WARNER INC.

Z The lower of L and the rate of interest per annum paid by the Bank of England on Special Deposits at or about 11:00 a.m. on the date of calculation.
For the purposes of calculating the Mandatory Cost: (i) C, L, S and Z are included in the formula as numbers and not as percentages, e.g. if C =0.15 percent and L = 7 percent, CL is calculated at 0.15 x 7; (ii) the formula is applied on the first day of each period for which it falls to be calculated (and the result shall apply for the duration of such period); (iii) each amount is rounded up to the nearest four decimal places; and (iv) if the formula produces a negative percentage, the percentage shall be taken as zero. If alternative or additional financial requirements are imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or any other fiscal, monetary or governmental authority or agency (including the European Central Bank) which in the Administrative Agent's reasonable opinion make the above formula (or any element thereof, or any defined term used therein) no longer appropriate, the Administrative Agent (following consultation with the Borrowers and the Required Lenders) shall be entitled by notice to the Borrowers to stipulate such other formula as shall be suitable to apply in substitution for the above formulae. Any such variation shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties and shall apply from the date specified in such notice. For the purposes of this Schedule: "Bank of England Act" means the Bank of England Act 1998; "Eligible Liabilities" has the meaning given to that term in the Cash Ratio Deposits (Eligible Liabilities) Order 1998 or the applicable substitute order made under the Bank of England Act as in force on the date of application of the formula; "Fee Base" has the meaning given to that term in the Fees Regulations; "Fees Regulations" means the Banking Supervision (Fees) Regulations 2001 or the applicable substitute regulations made under the Bank of England Act as are in force on the date of application of the formula; and "Special Deposits" has the meaning given to that term by the Bank of England on the date of application of the formula. Any reference to a provision of any statute, directive, order or regulation herein is a reference to that provision as amended or re-enacted from time to time.

(d) This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations are paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding (unless such Letter of Credit is cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.05(c) of the Credit Agreement) and the Commitments are terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time prior thereto either one or both of the Designated Borrowers may be free from any Obligations. (e) Each Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability hereunder, it will notify the Administrative Agent and such Lender in writing that such payment is made under this Guarantee for such purpose.

(g) No payment or payments made by either of the Designated Borrowers, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from either of the Designated Borrowers, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder who shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or payments received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations and, in the case of TBS and TWCI, the Time Warner Obligations, up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding (unless such Letter of Credit is cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.05(c) of the Credit Agreement) and the Commitments are terminated. 3. Right of Contribution.

Right of Setoff. (a) Each of AOL and Time Warner hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by either one or both of the Designated Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of either AOL or Time Warner (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the obligations of AOL or Time Warner, as applicable, to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify AOL and/or Time Warner, as the case may be, promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. (b) AOLTW hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by AOLTWFI under the Credit Agreement are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of AOLTW (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the obligations of AOLTW to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify AOLTW promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. (c) Each of TBS and TWCI hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by Time Warner under this Guarantee are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of either TBS or TWCI (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the obligations of TBS or TWCI, as applicable, to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify TBS and/or TWCI, as the case may be, promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. 5. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any Guarantor hereunder, or any setoff or application of funds of any Guarantor by any Lender, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or against any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from either one or both of the Designated Borrowers in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrowers on account of the Obligations are paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding (unless such Letter of Credit is cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.05(c) of the Credit Agreement) and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. 6. Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights. Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor, and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, (a) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations and any of the Time Warner Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any of the Obligations and any of the Time Warner Obligations continued, (b) the Obligations and/or the Time Warner Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (c) the Credit Agreement and any other Credit Document may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, and (d) any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations and/or the Time Warner Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto. 7. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and/or any of the Time Warner Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee; and all dealings between either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any Guarantor with respect to the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, any of the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers from the Obligations or of Time Warner from the Time Warner Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making a demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against either Designated Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from either Designated Borrower, any such other Guarantor or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of either Designated Borrower, any such other Guarantor or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings. 8. Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations or any of the Time Warner Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or Time Warner or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or Time Warner or any substantial part of either Designated Borrower's or Time Warner's property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. 9. Payments. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without setoff or counterclaim in the applicable Currency at the office of the Administrative Agent located at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York 10081 or to such other office as designated by the Administrative Agent. 10. Representations and Warranties. To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into the Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make their respective extensions of credit to the Borrowers thereunder, each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of the Credit Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.04(c), 3.06 and 3.10 on any date other than the Effective Date) as they relate to such Guarantor or to the Credit Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, are true and correct, and the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely on each of them as if they were fully set forth herein (it being understood that any representation or warranty set forth in Article III of the Credit Agreement that is qualified by a reference to a certain Borrower thereunder and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole shall not be deemed to apply to the Guarantor individually). The Guarantors agree that the foregoing representation and warranty shall be deemed to have been made by each Guarantor and shall be true and correct in all material respects on the date of each borrowing by a Borrower under the Credit Agreement on and as of such date of borrowing as though made hereunder on and as of such date. 11. Authority of Administrative Agent. Each Guarantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Guarantee with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Guarantee shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and any or all of the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Guarantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority. 12. Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Guarantor shall be effected in the manner provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement; any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to such Guarantor at its notice address set forth on Schedule 1 hereto. 13. Severability. Any provision of this Guarantee which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 14. Integration. This Guarantee and the other Credit Documents represent the agreement of each Guarantor with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no promises or representations by the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not reflected herein or in the other Credit Documents. 15. Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this Guarantee may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by the applicable Guarantor and the Administrative Agent, provided that any right, power or privilege of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders arising under this Guarantee may be waived by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in a letter or agreement executed by the Administrative Agent; provided, further, that no such amendment or waiver shall release any material Guarantor from its obligations hereunder without the written consent of each Lender. 16. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to paragraph 15 hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default or in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. 17. Section Headings. The section headings used in this Guarantee are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof. 18. Successors and Assigns. This Guarantee shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their successors and assigns; provided that no Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Guarantee without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. 19. Enforcement Expenses. Each Guarantor agrees, jointly and severally, to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its costs and expenses incurred in collecting against such Guarantor under this Guarantee or otherwise enforcing or protecting any rights under this Guarantee and the other Credit Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel to each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent. 20. Counterparts. This Guarantee may be executed by one or more of the Guarantors on any number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. 21. Acknowledgements. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that: (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Guarantee; (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Guarantor arising out of or in connection with this Guarantee or any other Credit Document, and the relationship between any or all of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and Lenders, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Credit Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Guarantors and the Lenders. 22. GOVERNING LAW. THIS GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF HTE STATE OF NEW YORK 23. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each Guarantor agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. (b) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee in any court referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (c) Each Guarantor irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in paragraph 12 of this Guarantee. Nothing in this Guarantee will affect the right of any party to this Guarantee to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 24. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS GUARANTEE OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

Each Guarantor under the Guarantee agrees as follows: 1. No Release. Such Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that such Guarantor will remain bound by the Guarantee notwithstanding any extension, renewal or other alteration of any Guaranteed Obligation. 2. Obligations Absolute. Such Guarantor waives presentation of, demand of, notice of dishonor and protest of any Guaranteed Obligation and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee shall not be affected by any of the following (and the Guarantor expressly waives any and all defenses arising out of, or based on, any of the following): (a) change in the manner, place or terms of payment (including the currency thereof) of, and/or change or extension of the time of payment of, renewal or alteration of, any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security or guarantee therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and the guarantee under the Guarantee shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered; (b) sale, exchange, release, surrender, realization upon or other alteration in any manner and in any order of any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or the Guarantee; (c) settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security or guarantee therefor or any liability (including any of those under the Guarantee) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or the Guarantee, and subordination of the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Person whose Obligations are guaranteed under the Guarantee (each such Person, a "Beneficiary"); (d) actions or failures to act in any manner referred to in the Guarantee that may deprive such Guarantor of its right to subrogation against any Beneficiary to recover fully indemnity for any payments made pursuant to the Guarantee; (e) failure of any Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Beneficiary or any guarantor or any successor thereto under the provisions of any Credit Document or any other agreement or otherwise; or (f) rescission, waiver, extension, renewal, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of any Credit Document or any instrument or agreement executed pursuant thereto. 3. Guarantee of Payment and Performance. The Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and performance when due and not of collection and such Guarantor waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Guaranteed Party to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Guaranteed Party in favor of any Beneficiary or any other Person. 4. Unenforceability of Obligations. The obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, or termination for any reason (other than by payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, discharge of any Beneficiary from any of the Guaranteed Obligations in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding or otherwise (except by payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, subject to the terms of Section 6 below and the next sentence). Such Guarantor further agrees that the Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of, interest on or any other amount with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Guaranteed Party or any other Person upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Beneficiary, any other Person or otherwise. 5. Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 151 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law) and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, each Guaranteed Party is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to such Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being expressly waived, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Guaranteed Party to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Guarantor to such Guaranteed Party under the Guarantee, irrespective of whether or not such Guaranteed Party shall have made any demand under the Guarantee and although said obligations, liabilities, deposits or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. 6. Reinstatement. If claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Party for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of the Guaranteed Parties repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Guaranteed Party or any of its property or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such Guaranteed Party with any such claimant (including any Beneficiary), then and in such event such Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon it, notwithstanding any revocation of the Guarantee or the cancellation of any Credit Document or other instrument evidencing any liability of any Beneficiary, and such Guarantor shall be and remain liable to such Guaranteed Party hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such Guaranteed Party. 7. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee or any set-off or application of funds of such Guarantor by any Guaranteed Party, such Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of any Guaranteed Party against any Beneficiary or guarantee or right of offset held by any Guaranteed Party of the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, nor shall such Guarantor seek to be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from any Beneficiary in respect of payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee, until all amounts owing to the Guaranteed Parties by any Beneficiary on account of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations have not been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Guaranteed Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly endorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. 8. Amendment and Waiver. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Guarantee, or consent to any departure by such Guarantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of the Required Lenders under the Credit Agreement or as otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement including, without limitation, Section 2.21 and Section 9.02(b) thereof. No waiver of any single breach or default under the Guarantee shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default. All notices, requests, demands or other communications to or upon such Guarantor or any Guaranteed Party shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made as provided in the Credit Agreement. 9. Successors and Assigns. The Guarantee shall be binding upon such Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the Guaranteed Parties and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Guaranteed Party, the rights and privileges herein conferred upon that Guaranteed Party shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions hereof; provided, however, that no Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under the Guarantee without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. 10. Governing Law. THE GUARANTEE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE UNDER, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. 11. Jurisdiction and Service. All judicial proceedings brought against such Guarantor with respect to the Guarantee may be brought in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York and by execution and delivery of the Guarantee, such Guarantor accepts for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with the Guarantee. Such Guarantor designates and appoints TWI, at its address specified for notices in the Credit Agreement and such other Persons as may hereafter be selected by such Guarantor irrevocably agreeing in writing to so serve, as its agent to receive on its behalf service of all process in any such proceedings in any such court, such service being hereby acknowledged by such Guarantor to be effective and binding service in every respect. A copy of any such process so served shall be mailed by registered mail to such Guarantor at its address as set forth above except that unless otherwise provided by applicable law, any failure to mail such copy shall not affect the validity of service of process. If any agent appointed by such Guarantor refuses to accept service, such Guarantor hereby agrees that service upon it by mail shall constitute sufficient notice. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Guaranteed Party to bring proceedings against such Guarantor in the courts of any other jurisdiction. 12. Waiver of Jury Trial. SUCH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT. Such Guarantor (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party to the Credit Documents has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and other parties to the Credit Documents have been induced to enter into the Credit Documents by, among other things, the foregoing waiver and certification. 13. Release. The Guarantee may be released only in accordance with Section 9.02(b) of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that if AOLTW elects to terminate the status of TWE or TWEAN as a Borrower and designates such terminated Borrower as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, pursuant to Section 2.21 and Section 6.08 of the Credit Agreement, (i) in the case of TWE, the TWE Partner Guarantee, and (ii) in the case of TWEAN, the Paragon Guarantee and the Paragon Partner Guarantee, shall be automatically released.

Reinstatement. If claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Party for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of the Guaranteed Parties repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Guaranteed Party or any of its property or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such Guaranteed Party with any such claimant (including any Beneficiary), then and in such event such Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon it, notwithstanding any revocation of the Guarantee or the cancellation of any Credit Document or other instrument evidencing any liability of any Beneficiary, and such Guarantor shall be and remain liable to such Guaranteed Party hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such Guaranteed Party. 7. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee or any set-off or application of funds of such Guarantor by any Guaranteed Party, such Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of any Guaranteed Party against any Beneficiary or guarantee or right of offset held by any Guaranteed Party of the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, nor shall such Guarantor seek to be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from any Beneficiary in respect of payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee, until all amounts owing to the Guaranteed Parties by any Beneficiary on account of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations have not been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Guaranteed Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly endorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. 8.

Successors and Assigns. The Guarantee shall be binding upon such Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the Guaranteed Parties and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Guaranteed Party, the rights and privileges herein conferred upon that Guaranteed Party shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions hereof; provided, however, that no Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under the Guarantee without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. 10. Governing Law.

Such Guarantor designates and appoints TWI, at its address specified for notices in the Credit Agreement and such other Persons as may hereafter be selected by such Guarantor irrevocably agreeing in writing to so serve, as its agent to receive on its behalf service of all process in any such proceedings in any such court, such service being hereby acknowledged by such Guarantor to be effective and binding service in every respect. A copy of any such process so served shall be mailed by registered mail to such Guarantor at its address as set forth above except that unless otherwise provided by applicable law, any failure to mail such copy shall not affect the validity of service of process. If any agent appointed by such Guarantor refuses to accept service, such Guarantor hereby agrees that service upon it by mail shall constitute sufficient notice. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Guaranteed Party to bring proceedings against such Guarantor in the courts of any other jurisdiction. 12. Waiver of Jury Trial. SUCH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT.

The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower specified on Schedule 2.03(B) or designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent shall have the right to demand payment from the applicable Lender and/or the applicable Borrower and they each severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (A) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, the Alternative Base Rate, and (B) in the case of Borrowings denominated in any Optional Currency, the interest rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent as the rate applicable to overnight settlements between banks for the amount advanced by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender or (ii) in the case of the applicable Borrower, the interest rate that would otherwise apply to such Borrowing.

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election (as more specifically set forth in Schedule 2.03(A)).

(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be a Base Rate Borrowing or a Eurocurrency or a TIBOR Borrowing; (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period". If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. All Loans denominated in Yen in each case shall be TIBOR Loans. (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, as the case may be, having a one month Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency and TIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date. (a) AOLTW may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $20,000,000 and (ii) AOLTW shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments. (b) AOLTW shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (a) of this Section at least one Business Day prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by AOLTW pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by AOLTW may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by AOLTW (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to such Borrower on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Yen Fronting Lender and the participating Lenders as their interests may appear the then unpaid principal amount of each Yen Loan owed by such Borrower on the Maturity Date. (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the applicable Borrowers. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). (f) AOLTW may elect to extend the Maturity Date of all or any portion of Revolving Loans outstanding on the Initial Maturity Date to the date that is the second anniversary of the Initial Maturity Date by giving written notice (the "Term Out Notice") of such election to the Administration Agent at least five days prior to the Initial Maturity Date. SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section. (b) The Borrower that desires to make a prepayment shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of any prepayment hereunder in accordance with Schedule 2.03(A). Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing hereunder shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12. SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee (a "Facility Fee") which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the average daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the Maturity Date (or such earlier date after the Commitment Termination Date on which the Loans are repaid in full), commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (b) The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Commitments terminate and the Revolving Credit Exposures of all the Lenders are paid or extinguished in full, a utilization fee (a "Utilization Fee") which shall accrue, with respect to any day, (a) that the Commitment Utilization Percentage is greater than 33% but less than or equal to 66%, at the rate of 0.0625% per annum on such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure, and (b) that the Commitment Utilization Percentage is greater than 66%, at the rate of 0.125% per annum on such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued Utilization Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, on the Maturity Date and on any date thereafter on which the Revolving Credit Exposures of all the Lenders are paid or extinguished in full, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All Utilization Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (c) [Intentionally left blank]. (d) The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between AOLTW and the Administrative Agent. (e) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of Facility Fees and Utilization Fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances absent manifest error in the calculation and/or payment thereof. SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate. (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. (c) The Loans comprising each Pound Sterling Overnight Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Pound Sterling Overnight Rate. (d) The Loans comprising each Euro Overnight Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Euro Overnight Rate. (e) The Loans comprising each TIBOR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the TIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Rate. (f) [Intentionally left blank]. (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to Loans in the Base Rate of the relevant Currency as provided above. (h) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon the Commitment Termination Date. (i) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and (ii) with respect to Loans denominated in Pounds, the interest rate thereon shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Base Rate, TIBOR Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate and LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing: (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the relevant Currency or the TIBOR Rate; or (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the relevant Currency or the TIBOR Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrowers and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing, as applicable, shall be ineffective and any such Borrowing referred to in such Interest Election Request shall, unless repaid by the applicable Borrower, be converted to (as of the last day of the then current Interest Period), or maintained as, a Base Rate Borrowing, as the case may be (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall, unless otherwise rescinded by the applicable Borrower, be made as a Base Rate Loan in the applicable Currency (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect fewer than all Types of Borrowings, then the other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted. SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market or the Tokyo interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loans made by such Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs actually incurred or reduction actually suffered. (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of the Commitment or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction actually suffered in respect of the Commitment or Loans made by such Lender hereunder. (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the applicable Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions unless a Lender gives notice to the applicable Borrowers that they are obligated to pay an amount under this Section within six months after the later of (i) the date the Lender incurs such increased costs, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital or (ii) the date such Lender has actual knowledge of its incurrence of such increased cost, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.14, no Lender shall demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction referred to above if it shall not be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any (it being understood that this sentence shall not in any way limit the discretion of any Lender to waive the right to demand such compensation in any given case). SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit in the applicable Currency equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the TIBOR Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits in the applicable Currency from other banks in the Eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of each Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if such Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable by such Borrower under this Section unless such amounts have been included in any amount paid pursuant to the proviso to Section 2.16(a)) paid by the Administrative Agent, or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) If a Lender or the Administrative Agent receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund, as determined by such Lender in its reasonable discretion), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant taxation authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Borrower, upon the request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such taxation authority. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (f) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to AOLTW (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a statement signed by an authorized signatory of the Lender that it is a U.S. Person and, if necessary to avoid United States backup withholding, a duly completed and signed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form) establishing that such Lender is organized under the laws of the United States and is not subject to United States backup withholding. (g) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require any Lender to disclose any confidential information regarding its tax returns or affairs. SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date shall, unless the Administrative Agent is able to distribute such amounts to the applicable Lenders on such date, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent (i) in New York, for payments in Dollars, (ii) in London, for payments in Euros or Pounds and (iii) in Tokyo, for payments in Yen, in each case, at the offices for the Administrative Agent set forth in Section 9.01, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient in like funds promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder, whether such payments are made in respect of principal, interest or fees, shall be made in the Currency in which the applicable payment obligation is due; provided, that payments in respect of Facility Fees pursuant to Section 2.11 and any other payments (not in respect of principal, interest or fees) or reimbursements shall be payable in Dollars. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from any Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal, then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties. (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and accrued interest thereon owing by any Borrower than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans of other Lenders owing from such Borrower to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by such Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due from such Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, (i) if the relevant amount is denominated in Pounds Sterling, at the Pound Sterling Overnight Rate (ii) if the relevant amount is denominated in Dollars, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (iii) if the relevant amount is denominated in any other Currency, at the interest rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent as the rate applicable for overnight settlements between banks for the amount paid by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Borrower. (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender from or on behalf of any Credit Party or otherwise in respect of the Obligations to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Such Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender hereunder, then AOLTW may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) AOLTW shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will be made to a Lender reasonably expected to result in a reduction in the compensation or payments to be paid by the Borrowers pursuant to such sections. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling AOLTW to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. SECTION 2.19. Prepayments Required Due to Currency Fluctuation. (a) Not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter of AOLTW or at such other time as is reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (the "Calculation Time"), the Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Equivalent of the total Revolving Credit Exposures outstanding as of such date. (b) If at the Calculation Time, the Dollar Equivalent of the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the total Commitments then in effect by 5% or more, then within five Business Days of notice to the Borrowers thereof, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Revolving Loans in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.19(b) shall be construed to require the Administrative Agent to calculate compliance under this Section 2.19(b) other than at the times set forth in Section 2.19(a). (c) If at the Calculation Time, the Dollar Equivalent of the total Yen Loans exceeds the total Yen Commitments then in effect by 5% or more, then within five Business Days of notice to the Borrowers thereof, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Yen Loans in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.19(c) shall be construed to require the Administrative Agent to calculate compliance under this Section 2.19(c) other than at the times set forth in Section 2.19(a). SECTION 2.20. Adoption of the Euro. Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro in any Participating Member State and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. Each obligation under this Agreement of a party to this Agreement which has been denominated in the National Currency Unit of a Subsequent Participant shall be redenominated into the Euro in accordance with EMU Legislation immediately upon such Subsequent Participant becoming a Participating Member State (but otherwise in accordance with EMU Legislation). If, in relation to the currency of any Subsequent Participant, the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to such currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such Subsequent Participant becomes a Participating Member State; provided, that if any Loan in the currency of such Subsequent Participant which is subject to an Interest Period is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period. SECTION 2.21. Termination of Certain Borrowers. AOLTW may elect by written notice to the Administrative Agent to terminate the status of TWE or TWEAN as a Borrower under the Facilities; provided that at the time of such election TWE or TWEAN, as the case may be, is not obligated in respect of any outstanding Loans under either of the Facilities. Upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice of termination, AOLTW may designate such terminated Borrower as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 6.08. Upon the termination of TWE or TWEAN, as the case may be, as a Borrower hereunder pursuant to this Section, any Guarantees of the Obligations of such Borrower shall terminate without any further action. ARTICLE III Representations and Warranties Each Borrower represents and warrants (as to itself and its Restricted Subsidiaries) to the Lenders that: SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each Credit Party and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required. SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability.

(b) any Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount (other than an amount referred to in clause (a) of this Article) payable under this Agreement, when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of five days; (c) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by or on behalf of any Credit Party in any Credit Document or any amendment or modification thereof, or in any report, certificate, financial statement or other document furnished pursuant to or in connection with any Credit Document or any amendment or modification thereof, shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed made;

(f) any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall fail to make any payment (whether of principal or interest and regardless of amount) in respect of any Material Indebtedness, when and as the same shall become due and payable after giving effect to any applicable grace periods; (g) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables or permits (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to cause any Material Indebtedness to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity; provided that this clause (g) shall not apply to secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness; (h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or other relief in respect of any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower or its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets, under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed for 60 days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered;

(j) any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower shall become unable, admit in writing or fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; (k) one or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $200,000,000 shall be rendered against any Borrower, any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower or any combination thereof or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor (whose liquidated judgment, along with those of any other judgment creditor's, exceeds $200,000,000) to attach or levy upon any assets of any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of any Borrower to enforce any such judgment, and the same shall remain undischarged for a period of 60 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, vacated or bonded pending appeal; (l) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, when taken together with all other ERISA Events (with respect to which a Borrower has a liability which has not yet been satisfied) that have occurred, could, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (m) except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, any of the Guarantees shall cease, for any reason, to be in full force and effect or any Credit Party shall so assert; or (n) a Change in Control shall occur; then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to a Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to AOLTW, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of any Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower; and in case of any event with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of any Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower. ARTICLE VIII The Agents Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Company or Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Company that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by any Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under any Credit Document or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Credit Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by a proper Person. An initial list of the proper Persons with respect to the Borrowers appears on Schedule 8. Schedule 8 shall not be altered except in writing by a Person appearing thereon (or by a successor to such Person occupying the equivalent office). The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon so long as such statement, in the case of a Borrowing Request, complies with the requirements of Section 2.03 in all material respects (it being understood that oral notices of borrowing will be confirmed in writing by such Borrower in accordance with Section 2.03). The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor which, so long as no Event of Default is continuing, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), ratably according to their Commitments in effect (or at any time after the Commitments have terminated, their Revolving Credit Exposure) on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Commitments (or, if the Commitments have terminated earlier, their Revolving Credit Exposures) immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. The Co-Syndication Agents and Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in their capacity as such. ARTICLE IX Miscellaneous SECTION 9.01. Notices. Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by facsimile, as follows: (a) if to AOLTW, TWE or TWEAN, to it at 75 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10019, Attention of Chief Financial Officer (Facsimile No. (212) 405-5213), with copies to its General Counsel (Facsimile No. (212) 258-3172), and its Treasurer (Facsimile No. (212) 258-3020); (b) if to AOLTWFI, to it at 1 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1 Ireland, Attention of Gillian Connolly (Facsimile No. 353-1-622-2222), with a copy to AOLTW as specified above; (c) if to the Administrative Agent, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, Agent Bank Services Group, One Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York 10081, Attention of Janet Belden (Facsimile No. 212-552-5658), with a copy to (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank, 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, Attention of Joan Fitzgibbon (Facsimile No. 212-270-4164); (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, JPMorgan Chase Bank, London Branch, 125 London Wall, London, EC2Y 5AJ, Attention of Steve Clarke (Facsimile No. 44-20-7777-2360); and (iii) in the case of a Yen Loan, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Tokyo Branch, 5-2-20, Akasaka, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107-6151 Japan, Attention of Naoko Morimoto, Banking Service Operations (Facsimile No. 813-5570-7539); (d) [Intentionally left blank]; (e) [Intentionally left blank] and (f) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or facsimile number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire. Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release any Guarantor under the Primary Guarantee without the written consent of each Lender, or (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) AOLTW shall, or shall cause the Borrowers to, pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Credit Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents or the Lenders, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Agents or the Lenders in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with any Credit Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof, it being understood that the Agents and the Lenders shall use, and AOLTW shall only be required to pay such fees, charges and disbursements of, a single counsel, unless (and to the extent) conflicts of interests require the use of more than one counsel. (b) AOLTW shall, or shall cause the Borrowers to, indemnify each Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Credit Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of, or the proposed use of, the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by any Company, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to any Company, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. (c) To the extent that any of the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender except in accordance with Section 6.04 (and any attempted assignment or transfer by such Credit Party without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, each of AOLTW and the Administrative Agent must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining balance of the assigning Lender's Commitment, each assignment shall not be less than an aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000, (iii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining balance of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the remaining amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender after giving effect to such assignment shall not be less than $15,000,000 unless, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), each of AOLTW and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, (iv) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) except in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender on or about the Effective Date, the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee shall be sufficient to record an assignment under both Facilities), and (vi) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; provided further that any consent of AOLTW otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall (i) continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03) and (ii) continue to be subject to the confidentiality provisions hereof. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Lender hereunder without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this Section. (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (e) Any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers' prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) Each Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (g) above. (i) Each Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance. SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Lenders constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any of the Credit Parties (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all the obligations of any of the Credit Parties now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. SECTION 9.09.

SCHEDULE 1.01 CALCULATION OF MANDATORY COST The mandatory cost rate referred to in the definition of "Pound Sterling Overnight Rate" in Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement will be the rate determined by the Administrative Agent (rounded upward, if necessary, to four decimal places) in accordance with the following formula (expressed as a percentage per annum): CL + S(L - Z) + 0.01F --------------------- 100 - (C + S) Where on the day of application of the formula: C The amount required to be held as a non-interest bearing cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England expressed as a percentage of each of the Reference Bank's Eligible Liabilities (above any stated minimum). F The amount of Pound Sterling per (pound)1,000,000 of the fee base of each Reference Bank payable to the Financial Services Authority per annum (disregarding any minimum fee payable under the Fees Regulations). L The rate of interest per annum at which Pound Sterling deposits of an amount comparable to the Borrowing or other amount are offered by each Reference Bank to leading banks in the London interbank market at or about 11:00 a.m. on the date of calculation for a period comparable to the period for which the Mandatory Cost is to be calculated; or The Pound Sterling Overnight Rate for the relevant day as calculated without taking into account the Mandatory Cost is the rate of interest (less margin and the Mandatory Cost) payable on that day on the related Borrowing pursuant to clause Section 2.12 of this Agreement. S The amount required to be placed as Special Deposits with the Bank of England, expressed as a percentage of each of the Reference Bank's Eligible Liabilities (above any stated minimum). Z The lower of L and the rate of interest per annum paid by the Bank of England on Special Deposits at or about 11:00 a.m. on the date of calculation.
For the purposes of calculating the Mandatory Cost: (i) C, L, S and Z are included in the formula as numbers and not as percentages, e.g. if C = 0.15 percent and L = 7 percent, CL is calculated at 0.15 x 7; (ii) the formula is applied on the first day of each period for which it falls to be calculated (and the result shall apply for the duration of such period); (iii) each amount is rounded up to the nearest four decimal places; and (iv) if the formula produces a negative percentage, the percentage shall be taken as zero. If alternative or additional financial requirements are imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or any other fiscal, monetary or governmental authority or agency (including the European Central Bank) which in the Administrative Agent's reasonable opinion make the above formula (or any element thereof, or any defined term used therein) no longer appropriate, the Administrative Agent (following consultation with the Borrowers and the Required Lenders) shall be entitled by notice to the Borrowers to stipulate such other formula as shall be suitable to apply in substitution for the above formulae. Any such variation shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties and shall apply from the date specified in such notice. For the purposes of this Schedule: "Bank of England Act" means the Bank of England Act 1998; "Eligible Liabilities" has the meaning given to that term in the Cash Ratio Deposits (Eligible Liabilities) Order 1998 or the applicable substitute order made under the Bank of England Act as in force on the date of application of the formula; "Fee Base" has the meaning given to that term in the Fees Regulations; "Fees Regulations" means the Banking Supervision (Fees) Regulations 2001 or the applicable substitute regulations made under the Bank of England Act as are in force on the date of application of the formula; and "Special Deposits" has the meaning given to that term by the Bank of England on the date of application of the formula. Any reference to a provision of any statute, directive, order or regulation herein is a reference to that provision as amended or re-enacted from time to time.

(g) No payment or payments made by either of the Designated Borrowers, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from either of the Designated Borrowers, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder who shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or payments received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations and, in the case of TBS and TWCI, the Time Warner Obligations, up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated. 3. Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder who has not paid its proportionate share of such payment.

Right of Setoff. (a) Each of AOL and Time Warner hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by either one or both of the Designated Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of either AOL or Time Warner (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the obligations of AOL or Time Warner, as applicable, to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify AOL and/or Time Warner, as the case may be, promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. (b) AOLTW hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by AOLTWFI under the Credit Agreement are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of AOLTW (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the obligations of AOLTW to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify AOLTW promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. (c) Each of TBS and TWCI hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by Time Warner under this Guarantee are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of either TBS or TWCI (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the obligations of TBS or TWCI, as applicable, to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify TBS and/or TWCI, as the case may be, promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. 5. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any Guarantor hereunder, or any setoff or application of funds of any Guarantor by any Lender, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or against any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from either one or both of the Designated Borrowers in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrowers on account of the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. 6. Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights. Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor, and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, (a) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations and any of the Time Warner Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any of the Obligations and any of the Time Warner Obligations continued, (b) the Obligations and/or the Time Warner Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (c) the Credit Agreement and any other Credit Document may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, and (d) any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations and/or the Time Warner Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto. 7. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and/or any of the Time Warner Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee; and all dealings between either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any Guarantor with respect to the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, any of the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers from the Obligations or of Time Warner from the Time Warner Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making a demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against either Designated Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or the Time Warner Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from either Designated Borrower, any such other Guarantor or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of either Designated Borrower, any such other Guarantor or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings. 8. Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations or any of the Time Warner Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or Time Warner or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or Time Warner or any substantial part of either Designated Borrower's or Time Warner's property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. 9. Payments. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without setoff or counterclaim in the applicable Currency at the office of the Administrative Agent located at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York 10081 or to such other office as designated by the Administrative Agent. 10. Representations and Warranties. To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into the Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make their respective extensions of credit to the Borrowers thereunder, each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of the Credit Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.04(c), 3.06 and 3.10 on any date other than the Effective Date) as they relate to such Guarantor or to the Credit Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, are true and correct, and the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely on each of them as if they were fully set forth herein (it being understood that any representation or warranty set forth in Article III of the Credit Agreement that is qualified by a reference to a certain Borrower thereunder and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole shall not be deemed to apply to the Guarantor individually). The Guarantors agree that the foregoing representation and warranty shall be deemed to have been made by each Guarantor and shall be true and correct in all material respects on the date of each borrowing by a Borrower under the Credit Agreement on and as of such date of borrowing as though made hereunder on and as of such date. 11.

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion.

The section headings used in this Guarantee are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof. 18.

Guarantee of Payment and Performance. The Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and performance when due and not of collection and such Guarantor waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Guaranteed Party to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Guaranteed Party in favor of any Beneficiary or any other Person. 4. Unenforceability of Obligations. The obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, or termination for any reason (other than by payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, discharge of any Beneficiary from any of the Guaranteed Obligations in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding or otherwise (except by payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, subject to the terms of Section 6 below and the next sentence). Such Guarantor further agrees that the Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of, interest on or any other amount with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Guaranteed Party or any other Person upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Beneficiary, any other Person or otherwise. 5. Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 151 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law) and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, each Guaranteed Party is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to such Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being expressly waived, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Guaranteed Party to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Guarantor to such Guaranteed Party under the Guarantee, irrespective of whether or not such Guaranteed Party shall have made any demand under the Guarantee and although said obligations, liabilities, deposits or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. 6. Reinstatement.

No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee or any set-off or application of funds of such Guarantor by any Guaranteed Party, such Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of any Guaranteed Party against any Beneficiary or guarantee or right of offset held by any Guaranteed Party of the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, nor shall such Guarantor seek to be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from any Beneficiary in respect of payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee, until all amounts owing to the Guaranteed Parties by any Beneficiary on account of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations have not been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Guaranteed Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly endorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. 8.

Governing Law. THE GUARANTEE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE UNDER, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. 11. Jurisdiction and Service.

Such Guarantor designates and appoints TWI, at its address specified for notices in the Credit Agreement and such other Persons as may hereafter be selected by such Guarantor irrevocably agreeing in writing to so serve, as its agent to receive on its behalf service of all process in any such proceedings in any such court, such service being hereby acknowledged by such Guarantor to be effective and binding service in every respect. A copy of any such process so served shall be mailed by registered mail to such Guarantor at its address as set forth above except that unless otherwise provided by applicable law, any failure to mail such copy shall not affect the validity of service of process. If any agent appointed by such Guarantor refuses to accept service, such Guarantor hereby agrees that service upon it by mail shall constitute sufficient notice. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Guaranteed Party to bring proceedings against such Guarantor in the courts of any other jurisdiction. 12. Waiver of Jury Trial. SUCH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT.

Attachment A GUARANTEE TERMS Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Guarantee to which these terms are attached (the "Guarantee"). Each Guarantor under the Guarantee agrees as follows: 1. No Release. Such Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that such Guarantor will remain bound by the Guarantee notwithstanding any extension, renewal or other alteration of any Guaranteed Obligation. 2. Obligations Absolute. Such Guarantor waives presentation of, demand of, notice of dishonor and protest of any Guaranteed Obligation and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee shall not be affected by any of the following (and the Guarantor expressly waives any and all defenses arising out of, or based on, any of the following): (a) change in the manner, place or terms of payment (including the currency thereof) of, and/or change or extension of the time of payment of, renewal or alteration of, any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security or guarantee therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and the guarantee under the Guarantee shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered; (b) sale, exchange, release, surrender, realization upon or other alteration in any manner and in any order of any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or the Guarantee; (c) settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security or guarantee therefor or any liability (including any of those under the Guarantee) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or the Guarantee, and subordination of the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Person whose Obligations are guaranteed under the Guarantee (each such Person, a "Beneficiary"); (d) actions or failures to act in any manner referred to in the Guarantee that may deprive such Guarantor of its right to subrogation against any Beneficiary to recover fully indemnity for any payments made pursuant to the Guarantee; (e) failure of any Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Beneficiary or any guarantor or any successor thereto under the provisions of any Credit Document or any other agreement or otherwise; or (f) rescission, waiver, extension, renewal, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of any Credit Document or any instrument or agreement executed pursuant thereto. 3. Guarantee of Payment and Performance. The Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and performance when due and not of collection and such Guarantor waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Guaranteed Party to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Guaranteed Party in favor of any Beneficiary or any other Person. 4. Unenforceability of Obligations. The obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, or termination for any reason (other than by payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, discharge of any Beneficiary from any of the Guaranteed Obligations in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding or otherwise (except by payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, subject to the terms of Section 6 below and the next sentence). Such Guarantor further agrees that the Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of, interest on or any other amount with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Guaranteed Party or any other Person upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Beneficiary, any other Person or otherwise. 5. Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 151 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law) and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, each Guaranteed Party is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to such Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being expressly waived, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Guaranteed Party to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Guarantor to such Guaranteed Party under the Guarantee, irrespective of whether or not such Guaranteed Party shall have made any demand under the Guarantee and although said obligations, liabilities, deposits or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. 6. Reinstatement. If claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Party for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of the Guaranteed Parties repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Guaranteed Party or any of its property or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such Guaranteed Party with any such claimant (including any Beneficiary), then and in such event such Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon it, notwithstanding any revocation of the Guarantee or the cancellation of any Credit Document or other instrument evidencing any liability of any Beneficiary, and such Guarantor shall be and remain liable to such Guaranteed Party hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such Guaranteed Party. 7. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee or any set-off or application of funds of such Guarantor by any Guaranteed Party, such Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of any Guaranteed Party against any Beneficiary or guarantee or right of offset held by any Guaranteed Party of the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, nor shall such Guarantor seek to be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from any Beneficiary in respect of payments made by such Guarantor under the Guarantee, until all amounts owing to the Guaranteed Parties by any Beneficiary on account of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations have not been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Guaranteed Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly endorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. 8. Amendment and Waiver. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Guarantee, or consent to any departure by such Guarantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of the Required Lenders under the Credit Agreement or as otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement including, without limitation, Section 2.21 and Section 9.02(b) thereof. No waiver of any single breach or default under the Guarantee shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default. All notices, requests, demands or other communications to or upon such Guarantor or any Guaranteed Party shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made as provided in the Credit Agreement. 9. Successors and Assigns. The Guarantee shall be binding upon such Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the Guaranteed Parties and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Guaranteed Party, the rights and privileges herein conferred upon that Guaranteed Party shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions hereof; provided, however, that no Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under the Guarantee without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. 10. Governing Law. THE GUARANTEE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE UNDER, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. 11. Jurisdiction and Service. All judicial proceedings brought against such Guarantor with respect to the Guarantee may be brought in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York and by execution and delivery of the Guarantee, such Guarantor accepts for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with the Guarantee. Such Guarantor designates and appoints TWI, at its address specified for notices in the Credit Agreement and such other Persons as may hereafter be selected by such Guarantor irrevocably agreeing in writing to so serve, as its agent to receive on its behalf service of all process in any such proceedings in any such court, such service being hereby acknowledged by such Guarantor to be effective and binding service in every respect. A copy of any such process so served shall be mailed by registered mail to such Guarantor at its address as set forth above except that unless otherwise provided by applicable law, any failure to mail such copy shall not affect the validity of service of process. If any agent appointed by such Guarantor refuses to accept service, such Guarantor hereby agrees that service upon it by mail shall constitute sufficient notice. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Guaranteed Party to bring proceedings against such Guarantor in the courts of any other jurisdiction. 12. Waiver of Jury Trial. SUCH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CREDIT DOCUMENT. Such Guarantor (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party to the Credit Documents has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and other parties to the Credit Documents have been induced to enter into the Credit Documents by, among other things, the foregoing waiver and certification. 13. Release. The Guarantee may be released only in accordance with Section 9.02(b) of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that if AOLTW elects to terminate the status of TWE or TWEAN as a Borrower and designates such terminated Borrower as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, pursuant to Section 2.21 and Section 6.08 of the Credit Agreement, (i) in the case of TWE, the TWE Partner Guarantee, and (ii) in the case of TWEAN, the Paragon Guarantee and the Paragon Partner Guarantee, shall be automatically released.
