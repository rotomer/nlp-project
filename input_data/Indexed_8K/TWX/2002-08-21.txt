Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Original Partnership Agreement or in any Transaction Agreement, each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that AT&T or Comcast shall be deemed not restricted or prohibited hereunder or thereunder from consummating any of the transactions contemplated by the AT&T Comcast Merger Agreement or any Permitted AT&T Transfer. 8.6 PRE-CLOSING DISCLOSURES. If at the time that all conditions set forth in Sections 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3 are satisfied or waived (other than the condition specified in Section 11.2(c) and other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and will in fact be satisfied at the Closing) AOLTW in good faith notifies AT&T and Comcast in writing of the existence of breaches of representations and warranties made by the AOLTW Parties in Article V (setting forth with reasonable specificity the details of such breaches) that AOLTW acknowledges in such writing would result in the non-satisfaction of the condition to Closing set forth in Section 11.2(c) (with respect to Sections 5.24, 5.25, 5.26, 5.27, 5.28, 5.29, 5.30, 5.31, 5.32, 5.33 or 5.34) and, after receipt of such notice, AT&T waives such condition and the Closing occurs, none of the AT&T Parties, the Comcast Parties, the Company or any other Person shall have any rights hereunder (including under Section 13.3) or otherwise (including at Law) with respect to such breaches of representations and warranties (or any Losses arising therefrom), and such breaches of representations and warranties shall be disregarded for purposes of Section 13.5.
56 8.7 DISPOSITION CHANGES. (a) In connection with establishing the terms of any Disposition Trust or any Permitted AT&T Transferee upon which similar governmental restrictions, as described below, are applied (together with any Disposition Trust, a "DISPOSITION ENTITY") with respect to AT&T's or its Affiliates' interest in the Company (the "INTEREST"), (i) prior to submitting any drafts of definitive documents relating to such Disposition Entity to the relevant Governmental Authority, AT&T and Comcast will provide AOLTW with copies of such drafts, (ii) the parties will consult with each other and AOLTW will (within five (5) days of receipt of such draft documents, or such shorter period as is appropriate given the materiality of changes in such draft or the status of the process with the relevant Governmental Authority) seek in good faith to identify any reasonable federal Income Tax-related objections to any proposed changes to the terms of the Disposition Entity relative to those set forth in the Original Trust Terms (as defined below), PROVIDED, that failure to make any such objection shall not limit AOLTW's rights hereunder and (iii) AT&T and Comcast shall use reasonable best efforts, subject to any customary limitations under applicable Law (including, without limitation, FCC and FTC rules), to cause the terms governing such Disposition Entity to provide that (A) the governing trustee of such Disposition Entity (the "TRUSTEE") will have the right to exercise any voting rights of the Interest as described in paragraph 4 of Section 1A of the AT&T Disclosure Letter, (B) AT&T or one or more of its Affiliates will have the right to appoint (subject to notice to or approval of the relevant Governmental Authority) the Trustee and any successor trustee and (C) the Trustee will distribute to AT&T or its Affiliates all proceeds (other than Restricted Consideration as described in Section 1A of the Disclosure Letter and net of all fees and expenses owed to the Trustee) from any Disposition of the Interest or of any Restricted Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T shall not be required to take any action that would reasonably be likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a meaningful adverse effect (excluding effects by virtue of ownership interests in the Company) on AT&T or Comcast, as the case may be. "ORIGINAL TRUST TERMS" means the trust terms, insofar as material to the federal Income Tax characterization of the trust and the Interest, set forth in Section 1A of the AT&T Disclosure Letter. (b) Promptly upon determination of the definitive terms (the "DEFINITIVE TRUST TERMS") governing a Disposition Entity, AT&T shall provide AOLTW with a copy of such definitive terms (an "AT&T DISPOSITION NOTICE"). If there is any material deviation (it being agreed and understood that any change in the duration, so long as the duration is no longer than seven (7) years, of the Disposition Entity or the divestiture period of the Interest shall not be considered a material deviation under this section) between the Definitive Trust Terms and the Original Trust Terms (the "DEVIATION") and AOLTW determines in its reasonable judgment (after consultation with AT&T and Comcast) that the Deviation results in a risk (other than of a de minimus nature) of a material adverse effect on the federal Income Tax treatment of any of the Transactions to any AOLTW Party relative to the risk under the Original Trust Terms then, within ten (10) days of delivery of the AT&T Disposition Notice, AOLTW may provide AT&T with an irrevocable written notice of AOLTW's decision to terminate this Agreement (an "AT&T DISPOSITION TERMINATION NOTICE"), which notice shall set forth in
57 reasonable detail the legal and factual basis for AOLTW's determination, and any failure by AOLTW to deliver an AT&T Disposition Termination Notice in accordance with this Section 8.7 within such 10-day period shall constitute a waiver by AOLTW of its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.7. Within ten (10) days following delivery of an AT&T Disposition Termination Notice, AT&T shall provide AOLTW with written notice of AT&T's determination either (i) to agree to indemnify (with contest provisions similar to those set forth in Section 14.1(i) (but reversing the roles of AOLTW and AT&T) and subject to Section 14.4(b)) AOLTW against any incremental Income Tax cost arising out of an adverse effect identified in the AT&T Disposition Termination Notice to the extent resulting from the Deviation or (ii) to terminate this Agreement, and any failure by AT&T to deliver such written notice within such 10-day period shall constitute a determination by AT&T to terminate this Agreement, and upon such determination this Agreement shall automatically terminate. ARTICLE IX AOLTW/AT&T AGREEMENTS 9.1 High Speed Data Agreements. (a) As an inducement to the AOLTW Parties to enter into the Transactions, the parties hereto agree as follows: (i) If the AT&T-Comcast Merger is consummated prior to the Closing, then at the Closing AT&T Comcast shall, and AOLTW shall cause AOL and TWE to, execute and deliver the AOL High Speed Data Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit D hereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that (x) following (A) consummation of the AT&T-Comcast Merger and prior to the Closing and (B) receipt of all required Authorizations of Governmental Authorities in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the AOL High Speed Data Agreement; AT&T Comcast may, in its sole discretion, elect (by delivering written notice to AOLTW) to enter into the AOL High Speed Data Agreement and (y) promptly following such election (and in any event within two Business Days), AT&T Comcast shall, and AOLTW shall cause AOL and TWE to execute and deliver the AOL High Speed Data Agreement. (ii) If the AT&T-Comcast Merger has not been consummated on or prior to March 1, 2003 and at any time thereafter all other conditions to the Closing are satisfied (or waived) (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and will in fact be satisfied at the Closing), then, in lieu of AT&T Comcast entering into the AOL High Speed Data Agreement in the Existing Form, at the Closing, AT&T shall, and AOLTW shall cause AOL and TWE to, execute and deliver the AOL High Speed Data Agreement in the form set forth on Section 9.1(a)(ii) of the AT&T Disclosure Letter. (b) To the extent permitted by Law, each of AOLTW, AT&T and Comcast agrees to begin operations implementation of the AOL High Speed Data Agreement, as applicable (including the Technical Specifications certification process) to
58 prepare for the Initial Deployment Date within a reasonable period of time prior to the anticipated Effective Date to permit the Deployment of the ISP Service in the Initial Markets as soon as possible after the Effective Date (each capitalized term used in this sentence, unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the AOL High Speed Data Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, at the time when all conditions to Closing are satisfied or waived other than the execution and delivery of the AOL High Speed Data Agreement, if an administrative or judicial action or proceeding brought by the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC challenging or objecting to the AOL High Speed Data Agreement shall be pending (or overtly threatened) and any such action or proceeding shall have been commenced (and not withdrawn) by the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC, in each case which would be reasonably likely to result in changes or modifications to the AOL High Speed Data Agreement to which AT&T would not be required to agree to pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) hereof then AT&T may elect at Closing, by delivery of written notice to AOLTW, not to execute and deliver the AOL High Speed Data Agreement and shall thereafter have no liability or obligation in respect of the AOL High Speed Data Agreement. Upon such election (the "ISP TERMINATION ELECTION"), the condition set forth in Section 11.3(d) shall be deemed incapable of being satisfied and AOLTW shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(d)(iii). 9.2 INTERIM AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ORIGINAL TWE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. Each of AT&T and AOLTW hereby agrees that following the execution of this Agreement and until Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance herewith), each such party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, refrain from Disposing of any Equity Securities of TWE or from pursuing any registration rights under Article XIII of the Original Partnership Agreement other than (i) transfers by AOLTW or its Affiliates to wholly owned Subsidiaries of AOLTW or to the Company, (ii) Permitted AT&T Transfers to Permitted AT&T Transferees and (iii) the AT&T Comcast Transactions. AOLTW, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby waives its right of first refusal it under Section 11.3 of the Original Partnership Agreement and any other transfer restrictions contained in Article XI of the Original Partnership Agreement in each case with respect to the Transactions, any of the AT&T Comcast Transactions or any Permitted AT&T Transfer. AOLTW, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby agrees that, following the Closing, Section 5.5 of the Original Partnership Agreement shall have no application to the businesses of AT&T Comcast and its Affiliates after giving effect to the AT&T-Comcast Merger and the AT&T Comcast Transactions. 9.3 CERTAIN POST-CLOSING RESTRICTIONS. (a) Neither AOLTW nor any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or its majority owned Subsidiaries) will (i) assume or otherwise repay the Company Indebtedness or any Indebtedness that is incurred to refinance the Company Indebtedness or guarantee the Company Indebtedness in each case for a period of two
59 years following the Closing or (ii) guarantee any Indebtedness that is incurred to refinance the Company Indebtedness for a period of 30 days following the Closing.

If AOLTW determines in its good faith judgment that the terms of the Company Indebtedness at Closing are not commercially reasonable and it notifies AT&T and Comcast in writing (the "OBJECTION Notice") of such determination by Closing, and within 135 days of Closing the Company refinances such Company Indebtedness, then AT&T shall, upon notice from the Company, promptly pay the Company cash in an amount equal to all fees, costs and expenses (including commitment fees and counsel fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the incurrence of the Company Indebtedness (collectively, the "COMPANY FEES AND EXPENSES"); PROVIDED that if the Objection Notice is delivered but the Company has not closed the refinancing of the Company Indebtedness within such 135-day period, then the Company will promptly pay cash to AT&T Broadband equal to 50% of the Company Fees and Expenses.

66 (ii) (A) the AT&T-Comcast Merger shall not have been consummated by January 15, 2003; (B) AOLTW shall have received a letter from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz ("WLRK") to the effect that in WLRK's judgment, based on communications with applicable Governmental Authorities and outside FCC counsel, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been a primary reason for the failure of the AT&T-Comcast Merger to have been consummated prior to that time; and (C) such termination is elected by AT&T on or prior to February 1, 2003, by written notice to the parties hereto (any such termination an "AT&T SPECIAL TERMINATION EVENT); (d) by AOLTW: (i) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of AT&T set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section 11.3(a), (b) or (c) not to be satisfied, and such condition shall be incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; (ii) if the AOLTW Stock Price is less than $6.665 as appropriately adjusted, if necessary, for any dividend or other distribution, subdivision, split or combination of shares with respect to the AOLTW Common Stock following the date hereof (the "SPECIFIED PRICE"); PROVIDED that if AOLTW desires to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1(d)(ii) it must deliver to AT&T and Comcast an irrevocable notice of termination pursuant to this Section 12.1(d)(ii) no later than 5:00 p.m. in New York City on the second Trading Day following the last Trading Day in the Valuation Period (which notice of termination will become automatically effective at 5:00 p.m. in New York City on the fourth Trading Day following the last Trading Day in the Valuation Period, unless, prior to such time, AT&T and Comcast agree, in an irrevocable written notice to AOLTW (the "ACCEPTANCE NOTICE"), to calculate the Specified Number by deeming the AOLTW Stock Price to be equal to the Specified Price, without duplication of any adjustments for dividends, distributions, stock splits, subdivisions or combinations (any such termination, an "AOLTW SPECIAL TERMINATION EVENT").

67 Section 12.3, Section 12.4 and Article XV (other than Section 15.14) shall survive the termination hereof and (b) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful breach by such party of this Agreement. 12.3 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12.3 and except for the Company Fees and Expenses (which shall be paid by the Company subject to Section 9.4), and except as otherwise expressly provided in another Transaction Agreement, all Transaction Expenses incurred by AOLTW, AT&T Corp., Comcast (or any of their respective Affiliates) shall be paid by AOLTW, AT&T Corp. and Comcast, respectively, in each case regardless of whether the Transactions are consummated.

(b) If BAS is not eligible for such engagement due to a conflict of interest, then the parties agree to select and engage an alternative Investment Banking Firm no later than 30 days after the date on which it is determined by either party acting in good faith that BAS is not eligible for such engagement. In the event that an Investment Banking Firm has not been selected by written agreement of the parties within 30 days, either party may submit to the American Arbitration Association, which shall select an Investment Banking Firm within 10 Business Days. The parties shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days) engage the alternative Investment Banking Firm so selected on the same terms as BAS currently is engaged (with such reasonable changes as may be requested by such firm to reflect their customary terms of
68 engagement; PROVIDED that such changes do not affect the scope or subject matter of the engagement or the determinations to be made thereunder); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the parties will agree to negotiate in good faith appropriate fees for such engagement which shall be shared equally by TWE and AT&T.

Upon an Existing Valuation Election, the Engagement Parties shall promptly direct BAS to deliver the Existing Valuations to AT&T and AOLTW, whereupon the determinations contained therein shall be final and binding on the parties in accordance with the Engagement Letter and the Original Partnership Agreement and Sections 12.4(a) and 12.4(b) above shall be of no further force or effect. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement (other than Section 9.2) or in any other Transaction Agreement shall be deemed to supersede or in any way alter or amend the terms of the Letter Agreements or the Engagement Letter. ARTICLE XIII SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION 13.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS. The representations and warranties of the AT&T Parties, the Comcast Parties and the AOLTW Parties in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto will survive Closing for a period of 12 months after the Closing; PROVIDED that notwithstanding the foregoing (i) none of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 5.15, 5.17, 5.18, 5.19, 5.20, 5.21 or 5.22 shall survive the Closing; (ii) all representations and warranties with respect to any Taxes (including the representations and warranties in Sections 3.8 and 5.6) (other than the representations and warranties in Sections 3.8(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) which will not survive the Closing and other than the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.33 that are not related to Income Taxes which will survive for a period of 12 months after the Closing), Environmental Law or ERISA matters will survive until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions) for such Taxes, Environmental Law or ERISA matters, respectively; and (iii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.7 shall survive in perpetuity. The periods of survival of the representations and warranties prescribed by this Section 13.1 are referred to as the "SURVIVAL PERIOD." Liabilities under representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will expire as of the expiration of the applicable Survival Period; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such expiration will not include, extend or apply to any
69 representation or warranty, the breach of which has been asserted in a written notice in accordance with Section 15.1 before such expiration or about which proper notice has been given before such expiration, identifying with specificity any facts or conditions that exist which, with the passage of time or otherwise, could reasonably be expected to result in a breach (and describing such potential breach in reasonable detail). The covenants and agreements in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and effect without limitation. Any representation or warranty which, pursuant hereto, does not survive the Closing shall be from and after the Closing null and void and of no further force or effect, to the same extent as if never made hereunder. The parties expressly agree that the sole purpose of such representation and warranty ceases upon the Closing. 13.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY AT&T. From and after the Closing, AT&T will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates, and its and their respective shareholders, officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, successors and assigns and any Person claiming by or through any of them, as the case may be, from and against any and all Losses incurred by such indemnified parties and arising out of, relating to or resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by any of the AT&T Parties or, following consummation of the AT&T-Comcast Merger, the Comcast Parties in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, except pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.8, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 or 4.5 and disregarding, for purposes of calculating Losses, all qualifications and exceptions contained therein relating to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard other than those contained in Section 3.7; (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of any of the AT&T Parties or, following consummation of the AT&T-Comcast Merger, the Comcast Parties contained in this Agreement; (c) without duplication of any indemnification claims or rights arising out of clause (a) above, any claims or rights with respect to employees, employment or any employee benefit plan or arrangement, in each case arising out of, relating to or resulting from any occurrence, practice, condition, action or inaction on or prior to the Closing involving the Company, any entity that is or was, on or prior to the Closing, a member of the Company's ERISA Group, or the predecessors of any of them, including, without limitation Losses incurred by reason of the Company having been, at any time on or prior to the Closing, a member of an ERISA Group (collectively, "EMPLOYEE CLAIMS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Employee Claims shall not include any claims or rights (i) solely in connection with employment or termination thereof of any individual hired upon or following Closing by AOLTW or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (ii) arising on or after Closing with respect to service on or after the Closing under any benefit plans maintained or sponsored by such entities; or (d) any failure of a Permitted AT&T Transferee to comply with its obligations under any Transaction Agreement or any Applicable Agreements (assuming, for purposes of this indemnity, that each Permitted AT&T Transferee assumed all obligations of the transferor hereunder and thereunder). 13.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY AOLTW. From and after the Closing, AOLTW will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates, and its and their respective shareholders, officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, successors and assigns and any Person claiming by or through any of them, as the case may be, from
70 and against any and all Losses incurred by such indemnified parties and arising out of, relating to or resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by any of the AOLTW Parties in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, except pursuant to Section 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6, and disregarding, for purposes of calculating Losses, all qualifications and exceptions contained therein (other than in Section 5.7, 5.8 or 5.9) relating to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of any of the AOLTW Parties contained in this Agreement (other than those contained in Section 9.3, which shall be governed by Section 14.1(c)). 13.4 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. Promptly after the receipt of notice of any claim, action, suit or proceeding by any Third Party (collectively, an "ACTION"), which Action is subject to indemnification under Article XIII of this Agreement, the party receiving such notice (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") will give reasonable written notice to the party from whom indemnification is claimed (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided in the preceding sentence shall not relieve the related Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 13.2 or 13.3, as the case may be, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party will be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the Indemnifying Party, to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any such Action unless the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time (but in no event later than 30 days) after the giving of such notice by the Indemnified Party, (a) notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Party's intention to assume such defense and (b) retains legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Action, in which case the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to exercise such full control. The other Party will cooperate with the Party assuming the defense, compromise or settlement of any such Action in accordance with this Agreement in any manner that such Party reasonably may request. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of any such Action, the Indemnified Party will have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise or settlement of the Action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) any relief other than the payment of money damages is sought against the Indemnified Party or (iii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by its counsel that there may be one or more defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, and in any such case that portion of the fees and expenses of such separate counsel that are reasonably related to matters covered by the indemnity provided in this Article 13 will be paid by the Indemnifying Party; PROVIDED that the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the expenses of more than one separate counsel in each jurisdiction for each Indemnified Party so entitled to separate counsel. Expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party will settle or compromise any such Action for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld), unless the Indemnifying Party has failed to undertake control of such Action in the manner provided in this Section 13.4. No Indemnifying Party will settle or compromise
71 any such Action in which any relief other than the payment of money damages is sought against any Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnified Party consents in writing to such compromise or settlement. 13.5 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: (a) AT&T will not be liable for indemnification payments under Section 13.2(a) (other than with respect to Section 3.7) for any Losses of any Person entitled to indemnification payments from AT&T under such Section unless the amount of all such Losses for which AT&T would, but for the provisions of this sentence, be liable exceeds, on an aggregate basis, $500 million, in which case AT&T will be liable only for such Losses that exceed $500 million. AT&T will not be liable for indemnification payments under Section 13.2(a) (other than with respect to Section 3.7) in excess of $3 billion. (b) AOLTW will not be liable for indemnification payments under Section 13.3(a) (other than with respect to Sections 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) for any Losses of any Person entitled to indemnification payments from AOLTW under such Section unless the amount of all such Losses for which AOLTW would, but for the provisions of this sentence, be liable exceeds, on an aggregate basis, $500 million, in which case AOLTW will be liable only for such Losses that exceed $500 million. AOLTW will not be liable for indemnification payments under Section 13.3(a) (other than with respect to Sections 5.7 and 5.9) in excess of $3 billion. 13.6 PAYMENTS FOR INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNTS. Amounts payable in respect of any Losses that are subject to the indemnification obligations under Section 13.2 or 13.3 will be payable by the Indemnifying Party as incurred by the Indemnified Party and will bear interest at the rate per annum publicly announced from time to time by The Bank of New York as its prime rate plus two percent from the date the Losses for which indemnification is sought were incurred until the date of payment of indemnification by the Indemnifying Party. 13.7 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. The parties hereby agree that, after the Closing, the rights set forth in this Article 13 and Article 14 shall be their sole and exclusive remedies against each other for any claims relating to, arising out of or resulting from any breaches of the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement (except those pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5.) 13.8 ENFORCEMENT. AT&T (and any Disposition Trust that is a Permitted AT&T Transferee) shall have the right to enforce (on behalf and for the benefit of the Company and its Affiliates) the Company's and its Affiliates' rights to indemnification hereunder (other than pursuant to Section 13.2). The independent directors of the Company shall have the non-exclusive right to enforce the Company's and TWE's rights under the TWE Distribution Agreement and the TWIC Contribution Agreement.
72 ARTICLE XIV TAX MATTERS 14.1 TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) AT&T'S INDEMNIFICATION OF THE COMPANY. From and after the Closing and without duplication, AT&T shall be liable for and indemnify the Company for all Losses arising out of (i) all Taxes attributable to, imposed on, or for which the Company may otherwise be liable (including, without limitation, Taxes for which the Company may be liable under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 or comparable provision of foreign, state, local or provincial Law) for events occurring or periods ending on or before the Closing and, with respect to any taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing, the portion of such taxable year ending on and including the Closing including, in each case, the Transactions; and (ii) any breach of representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.8 of this Agreement. Media One of Colorado shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the Company received for such periods net of Taxes payable by the Company with respect to the receipt or accrual thereof and the Company shall cause such refund, net of any Taxes imposed on such refund amount, to be paid to Media One of Colorado promptly following any receipt thereof by the Company. (b) THE COMPANY'S INDEMNIFICATION OF AT&T. From and after the Closing and without duplication, the Company shall be liable for and indemnify AT&T and its Affiliates for the Taxes of the Company attributable to periods (or portions thereof) ending after the Closing other than those for which the Company is indemnified by Media One of Colorado under Section 14.1(a) of this Agreement. From and after the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the Company other than those refunds described in Section 14.1(a) and AT&T shall cause such refund, net of any Taxes imposed on such refund amount, to be paid to the Company promptly following any receipt thereof by Media One of Colorado. (c) AOLTW'S INDEMNIFICATION OF AT&T. From and after the Closing, AOLTW shall be liable for and indemnify and hold harmless AT&T and its Affiliates from and against all Losses incurred by such indemnified parties and arising out of, relating to or resulting from any breach of (i) any representation or warranty made by any of the AOLTW Parties in Section 5.6 of this Agreement or (ii) any covenant, agreement or obligation of any of the AOLTW Parties contained in Section 9.3 of this Agreement. (d) TAXES FOR STRADDLE PERIOD. For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 14.1, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company for a portion of a taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing (the "STRADDLE PERIOD"), and for any Tax period, the Tax for which is determined by the income of the period that begins before and ends after the Closing, (i) the determination of all Taxes of the Company that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
73 intangible), for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing generally shall be determined by assuming that the Company had a taxable year or period which ended at the close of the Closing, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis, and (ii) the determination of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i) above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the Company or otherwise measured by the level of any item of the Company for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing shall be determined by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. (e) CARRYBACKS. Following the Closing, whether or not the Company waives the right to carryback any Tax losses, credits or similar items attributable to the Company from a taxable year or period that begins after the Closing to a taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing, no payment with respect to such carrybacks shall be due from AT&T. (f) TAX RETURNS. AT&T shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) to the extent they relate to the Company and timely file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing and shall pay when due any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. The Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing and shall remit any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, and, with respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for Straddle Periods ("STRADDLE RETURNS"), such Straddle Returns shall be prepared in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by a Law). The Company shall permit AT&T to review and comment on each Straddle Return, and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by AT&T. AT&T shall permit the Company to review and comment on each Tax Return filed by MediaOne of Colorado (or caused to be filed by Media One of Colorado) after the date hereof for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing pursuant to this Section 14.1(f) to the extent they relate to the Company. The Company or AT&T, as applicable, shall pay to the other as agent an amount equal to the Taxes for which the payor is liable pursuant to Section 14.1 but which are payable with Tax Returns to be filed by the payee at least 10 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns. In the case of any Tax Return with respect to which the Company or AT&T (as the case may be) is permitted to review and comment pursuant to this Section 14.1(f), in the event the parties cannot agree on any Tax item covered in any such Tax Return, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. In the event the parties cannot reach agreement regarding such dispute within ten (10) days of the date on which one party
74 notifies the other of its disagreement, such dispute shall be resolved by submitting the same to a national accounting firm that does not have a material relationship with either party. (g) CONTEST PROVISIONS. The Company shall have sole and exclusive control over any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding related to Taxes imposed with respect to the Company other than with respect to Tax Returns with respect to periods ending on or before the Closing. AT&T shall promptly notify the Company in writing upon receipt by MediaOne of Colorado or any of its Affiliates of written notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local, provincial or foreign Tax audits or assessments with respect to the activities or income of the Company which may affect the tax liabilities of the Company for which AT&T would be required to indemnify the Company under Section 14.1(a) or for which the Company would be required to indemnify AT&T and its Affiliates under Section 14.1(b). Thereafter, from time to time, MediaOne of Colorado shall promptly notify the Company in the event any issue arises in connection with any such audits or assessments that relate specifically to the Company. The Company shall promptly notify AT&T in writing upon receipt by the Company or any of its Affiliates of written notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local, provincial or foreign Tax audits or assessments which may affect the tax liabilities of the Company for which AT&T would be required to indemnify the Company pursuant to Section 14.1(a). The Company shall not be relieved of its obligations to indemnify MediaOne of Colorado if AT&T fails to timely deliver the written notice described above except to the extent the Company is actually prejudiced thereby. AT&T shall not be relieved of its obligations to indemnify the Company if the Company fails to timely deliver the written notice described above except to the extent AT&T is actually prejudiced thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, AT&T shall have the right to represent the Company interests in, manage, contest, litigate, compromise and settle any Income Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; PROVIDED that AT&T shall provide prompt written notice to the Company that a Determination has been made with respect to any such audit or administrative or court proceeding and the Company shall have such rights as described in Section 14.1(h) hereof with respect to such matter. The Company shall be entitled to participate in the relevant portions of such audit or administrative or court proceeding to the extent reasonably practicable and at its own expense. AT&T shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the defense of any claim for Income Taxes for a year or period ending after the Closing which may be the subject of indemnification by AT&T pursuant to Section 14.1(a). The Company may not agree to settle any Income Tax claim for the portion of the year or period ending on the Closing which may be the subject of indemnification by AT&T under Section 14.1(a) without the prior written consent of AT&T, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (h) Within thirty (30) days after the Company receives a notice described in Section 14.1(g) hereof from AT&T, the Company may provide written notice to AT&T that it believes the Determination with respect to the audit or administrative or court proceeding is reasonably expected to materially adversely impact the Company for a tax period or periods ending after the Closing, in which case the
75 Company may seek a determination of the disputed item or items by a national accounting firm that does not have a material relationship with either party. The national accounting firm selected shall determine, and shall provide notice to AT&T and the Company stating, whether the Determination is a fair and appropriate outcome and whether the Determination has materially adversely impacted the Company. If the national accounting firm determines that the Determination is not a fair and appropriate outcome and is reasonably expected to materially adversely impact the Company for a tax period or periods ending after the Closing, AT&T shall indemnify the Company to the extent that the disputed item or items are reasonably expected to materially adversely impact the Company, as determined by the national accounting firm. (i) CONTEST PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 14.1(C). (i) Subject to Section 14(g), AT&T shall have sole and exclusive control over any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to AT&T's Tax Returns (a "PROCEEDING"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AOLTW shall have such participation rights as set forth in this paragraph (h) to the extent any such Proceeding relates to a tax issue, the resolution of which may give rise to a claim for Losses arising from a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.6 of this Agreement or a breach of the covenants contained in Section 9.3 of this Agreement (an "AOLTW ISSUE"). AT&T shall provide notice to AOLTW within thirty (30) days after an AOLTW Issue is raised by a Governmental Authority in connection with any Proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AOLTW shall not be relieved of its obligations to indemnify AT&T in respect of any Loss arising out of the Exchange if AT&T fails to timely deliver the written notice required to be given under this paragraph (i) except to the extent AOLTW is actually prejudiced by such failure. (ii) AOLTW shall have the right to (x) be present at any meeting or any Proceeding (or portion thereof) which relates solely to an AOLTW Issue, (y) review and comment on any written submissions by AT&T with respect to a Proceeding to the extent such submissions relate to an AOLTW Issue (which comments will be considered in good faith by AT&T), and (z) prepare for submission to AT&T written materials with respect to an AOLTW Issue which will be reviewed and considered in good faith by AT&T; PROVIDED that AT&T shall continue to have the sole and exclusive right to determine whether or not such materials will be submitted in the Proceeding. AT&T shall take reasonable steps to cause the AOLTW Issue to be considered in isolation from other issues in the Proceeding to the extent reasonably feasible. (iii) AT&T shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle, compromise and/or concede any Proceeding; PROVIDED, however, that AT&T must provide notice to AOLTW setting forth in reasonable detail the proposed settlement insofar as it relates to an AOLTW Issue. (iv) AOLTW shall pay its own costs in respect of its participation, as described in this paragraph (h).
76 (v) In any dispute with respect to a claim by AT&T under Section 14.1(c) the appropriateness of the conduct of the parties in the Proceeding, including any settlement thereof, shall be taken into account. (j) SPECIAL TAX DISTRIBUTION. (i) If at any time, and from time to time, after the date of the Closing, the cumulative amount of Section 751 Income exceeds $ 300,000,000, then TWE shall pay to the Company and the Company shall pay to Media One of Colorado or TWE shall pay to MediaOne of Colorado an amount equal to the product of (y) the amount of such excess and (z) 50% of the Combined Effective Tax Rate, as defined in Annex A of the Original Partnership Agreement, for the year in which the Closing occurs, reduced by any amounts previously so paid under this Section 14.1(i)(i). The parties agree that each such payment shall be treated as a distribution by TWE (i) to the Company and by the Company to Media One of Colorado in each case occurring immediately prior to the Exchange or (ii) to MediaOne of Colorado occurring immediately prior to the Exchange, as applicable. (ii) If at any time, and from time to time, after the date of the Closing, the cumulative amount of Adjustment Income, exceeds $300,000,000, then TWE shall pay to the Company and the Company shall pay to Media One of Colorado an amount equal to the product of (y) the amount of such excess and (z) 50% of the Combined Effective Tax Rate, as defined in Annex A of the Original Partnership Agreement, for the year in which the Closing occurs, reduced by any amounts previously so paid hereunder.

(iv) "SECTION 751 INCOME" means the aggregate of the Company's and MediaOne of Colorado's share of income arising under Section 751 of the Code as a result of the Transactions and "ADJUSTMENT INCOME" means any adjustment occurring after the Closing resulting from any Tax audit or court proceeding or the filing of any amended Tax return of TWE to the Company's share of the taxable income of TWE for all periods or portions thereof ending on or before the date of the Closing, but determined without regard to the Transactions. (v) The fact and the amount of any liability to make any payment or distribution under this Section 14.1(i) shall be determined exclusively by reference to the filing of a Tax Return by TWE or a Determination arrived at in connection with any Tax audit or other proceeding of TWE conducted by TWE or its Tax Matters Partner and without regard to any other proceeding, including any separate audit or other proceeding conducted by AT&T. AT&T shall have the right to attend all meetings and conferences between the TWE Tax Matters Partner and representatives of
77 any Governmental Authority in connection with any such audit and to attend any hearing, trial or other proceedings arising in connection therewith; provided that the TWE Tax Matters Partner shall have the sole and exclusive right to control an audit or other proceeding and to settle, compromise and/or concede any matter therein. TWE shall give AT&T reasonable notice in advance of any such meeting, conference or other proceeding and shall provide AT&T with all information that AT&T may reasonably request from time to time in connection with the foregoing. (vi) After the Closing, TWE (or its Tax Matters Partner) shall file its Tax Returns consistent with past practice, except to the extent required by Law. (vii) AT&T shall pay its own costs in respect of its participation, as described in this paragraph (j). (viii) Nothing in any Transaction Agreement shall prevent AT&T and its Affiliates (including MediaOne of Colorado and, for all periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing, the Company) from electing to take positions that are inconsistent with Tax Returns of TWE and not to be bound by any settlement or closing agreement entered into by TWE and any Governmental Authority; PROVIDED, that AT&T shall promptly notify TWE of any such action and shall keep TWE reasonably informed of the progress of any audit or other proceeding relating thereto. 14.2 ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing, each of AT&T, AOLTW and the Company shall: (a) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns or reports which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this Article 14; (b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with government authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company; (c) make available to the other party and to any government authority, as reasonably requested, all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the Company; (d) furnish the other party with copies of all written correspondence received from any government authority in connection with any Tax audit or written information request with respect to any taxable period for which the other party may have a liability under this Article 14; and (e) cooperate in good faith to minimize the amount of Section 751 Income, if any, recognized by TWE and its partners, including, without limitation, pursuant to an agreement similar to that described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.751-1(g) Example (3)(c) specifying the particular items of property (if any) deemed exchanged.
78 Notwithstanding the above, a party shall not be relieved of its obligations to indemnify the other party if the other party fails to comply with this Section 14.2 except to the extent that such indemnitor is actually prejudiced thereby. 14.3 MISCELLANEOUS. (a) Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement to which the Company is a party shall be terminated prior to the Closing. (b) Payment by an indemnitor of any amount due to an indemnitee under Section 14.1 shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by the indemnitee that payment of such amounts to the appropriate government authority or other applicable third party is due by the indemnitee, provided that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment earlier than five (5) business days before it is due to the appropriate government authority or applicable third party. (c) All amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 14.1 shall be paid promptly in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the indemnified party. 14.4 TAX EFFECTS OF INDEMNIFICATION. (a) For all Tax purposes (unless required by a change in applicable Tax Law or good faith resolution of a contest) the parties hereto agree to treat, and to cause their respective affiliates to treat any payment (i) to the Company by AT&T pursuant to an indemnification, reimbursement or refund obligation provided for in this Agreement (an "AT&T INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT"), or (ii) to MediaOne of Colorado by the Company pursuant to an indemnification, reimbursement or refund obligation provided for in this Agreement excluding any amount payable under Section 14.1(j) (a "COMPANY INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT" and, collectively with any AT&T Indemnification Payment, an "INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT") as (x) with respect to an AT&T Indemnification Payment, a contribution by MediaOne of Colorado to the Company occurring immediately prior to the Exchange, and (y) with respect to a Company Indemnification Payment, a distribution by the Company to MediaOne of Colorado occurring immediately prior to the Exchange. (b) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any amount payable under Section 14.1(j)) shall be (i) increased to take account of the net Tax cost, if any, incurred by the indemnitee arising from the receipt or accrual of an Indemnification Payment hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of the net Tax benefit, if any, realized by the indemnitee arising from incurring or paying such Loss. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or benefit, the indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt or accrual of any Indemnification Payment hereunder or incurring or paying any indemnified Loss. Any Indemnification Payment hereunder shall initially be made without regard to this Section 14.4(b) and shall be
79 increased or reduced to reflect any such net Tax cost (including gross-up) or net Tax benefit only after the indemnitee has actually realized such cost or benefit. For purposes of this Agreement, an indemnitee shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax cost or a net Tax benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such indemnitee is increased above or reduced below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes that such indemnitee would be required to pay but for the receipt or accrual of the Indemnification Payment or the incurrence or payment of such Loss. The amount of any increase or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustment with respect to the indemnitee's liability for Taxes, and payments between the parties hereto to reflect such adjustment shall be made. In the event that the parties disagree regarding the appropriate application of this Section 14.4(b), such disagreement shall be resolved by submitting the same to a national accounting firm that does not have a material relationship with either party. 14.5 CONSISTENT TAX TREATMENT. The parties intend that the transaction described in Section 2.6 hereof will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code and that the transaction described in Section 2.7 hereof shall constitute an exchange within the meaning of Section 351 of the Code of the Company Transferred Assets in exchange for stock of the Company and the assumption of liabilities by the Company. The parties further intend that following the transactions contemplated hereby, TWE shall continue to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and that the interests in TWE held by the Company, ATC and Media One of Colorado shall constitute partnership interests therein. The parties agree for all Tax purposes (unless required by a change in applicable tax Law or a good faith resolution of a contest) to treat the transactions described herein in the foregoing manner. 14.6 EXPENSES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all fees and expenses with respect to any dispute, disagreement, determination or other matter referred to a national accounting firm pursuant to Article 14, regardless of which party has referred such dispute, disagreement, determination or other matter to such national accounting firm, shall be borne equally by the parties thereto.

(b) No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law. 15.5 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

EXHIBIT 99.2 ------------ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AOL TIME WARNER ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING OF TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY AOL TIME WARNER TO ACQUIRE FULL OWNERSHIP OF WARNER BROS., HBO AND TWE'S INTERESTS IN THE WB NETWORK, COMEDY CENTRAL AND COURT TV NEW SUBSIDIARY TO OWN ALL AOL TIME WARNER AND TWE CABLE ASSETS; IPO TARGETED FOR FIRST HALF OF 2003 AOL HIGH SPEED BROADBAND TO BECOME AVAILABLE ON AT&T COMCAST SYSTEMS PASSING ABOUT 10 MILLION HOMES NEW YORK, AUGUST 21, 2002--AOL Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: AOL) today announced an agreement with AT&T (NYSE: T) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSK, CMCSA) to restructure Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (TWE). The Company also announced a broad carriage agreement that will make AOL High Speed Broadband available on a number of AT&T Comcast cable systems. AOL Time Warner's Chief Executive Officer Dick Parsons said: "This restructuring of TWE is the best possible outcome for our investors and marks another important step in achieving our Company's near-term priorities. Through this restructuring, we will simplify our overall structure, while maintaining the integrity of our balance sheet. AOL Time Warner will recapture total ownership and control of its content businesses, enabling us to manage this portfolio of assets for maximum value. And all of the Company's state-of-the-art cable assets will be combined for the first time into a well-capitalized, pure-play cable company. Finally, the broadband access agreement provides us with our first significant nonaffiliated third-party broadband cable carriage for AOL High Speed Broadband." RESTRUCTURING TWE As a result of this restructuring: AOL Time Warner will assume complete ownership of TWE's content assets, including Warner Bros. and Home Box Office (HBO), as well as TWE's interests in The WB Network, Comedy Central and Court TV. All of AOL Time Warner's cable assets, including those currently owned by TWE, will be owned by a new subsidiary of AOL Time Warner to be called "Time Warner Cable Inc." As part of the restructuring, AT&T (or AT&T Comcast, depending on when the transaction and merger close) will exchange its current stake in TWE, which at June 30, 2002 consisted of a $5.7 billion preferred interest and a 27.64% residual equity interest, for $2.1 billion in cash, AOL Time Warner common stock valued at $1.5 billion at the time of closing, and a 21% economic stake in the business of Time Warner Cable Inc. Upon completion of the restructuring, which is expected to occur upon receipt of local cable franchise approvals, where required, and other required regulatory approvals in early 2003, AOL Time Warner effectively
Page 2 of 3 will own a 79% economic stake in the business of Time Warner Cable Inc. AOL Time Warner will have a controlling voting interest in the new subsidiary and will consolidate Time Warner Cable Inc.'s financial results for accounting purposes. At closing, Time Warner Cable Inc. is expected to have approximately $8.1 billion in consolidated net debt and preferred equity. Subject to market conditions, AOL Time Warner plans to conduct an initial public offering of Time Warner Cable Inc. soon after the restructuring. It is anticipated that the first $2.1 billion raised in any such IPO would go to pay down Time Warner Cable Inc.'s debt incurred to fund the $2.1 billion cash payment to AT&T. Thereafter, AT&T will have certain priority registration rights with respect to its stake in Time Warner Cable Inc. Time Warner Cable Inc.'s cable television operations, which will include cable systems serving approximately 10.8 million subscribers, will be the world's most advanced, best-clustered cable television operations, with 93% of its customers in systems of 100,000 subscribers or more. Mr. Parsons said: "By gaining full ownership and control of Warner Bros. and HBO, as well as TWE's interest in The WB Network, Comedy Central and Court TV, we will have the flexibility to operate these businesses in a more integrated, efficient way. With a pure-play cable currency and what will be the strongest balance sheet in the cable industry, Time Warner Cable Inc. will be well positioned to maximize the value of our existing cable footprint and pursue future strategic opportunities." The restructuring agreement was approved by the boards of directors of AOL Time Warner, AT&T and Comcast. CARRIAGE OF AOL HIGH SPEED BROADBAND Under the terms of the AOL High Speed Broadband carriage agreement: AT&T Broadband and Comcast, which have announced plans to merge to form AT&T Comcast, will make AOL High Speed Broadband available on AT&T Comcast systems passing about 10 million homes within two years after closing. Key markets covered under the agreement include Boston, Seattle, Indianapolis and Nashville. The parties also agreed to roll out AOL High Speed Broadband on AT&T Comcast systems passing an additional 9 million homes in the future, subject to the parties' mutual satisfaction with the arrangements. Financial terms of the three-year AOL High Speed Broadband carriage arrangement were not made public. Mr. Parsons said: "The AOL High Speed Broadband carriage agreement provides us with a critical opportunity to partner with a key player in the cable industry. Our task is to develop broadband products and services that become embedded in consumers' lives, just as AOL has done in the narrowband world and HBO has done in cable television. We are confident that AOL members and other cable customers will increasingly take advantage of this upgrade to AOL High Speed Broadband access on AT&T Comcast systems, as they have on Time Warner Cable systems." AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case said: "The agreement announced today is an important step forward in achieving our company's strategic goals of simplifying our structure and expanding the reach of our AOL High Speed Broadband service. It gives AOL a new opportunity to market its High Speed Broadband service to a broader audience, and it will give AT&T Comcast's cable customers greater choice, convenience, and control over their Internet experience." Bear Stearns acted as lead financial advisor to AOL Time Warner. Lehman Brothers also served as a financial advisor to AOL Time Warner. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison acted as AOL Time Warner's legal advisor. ABOUT AOL TIME WARNER INC.
