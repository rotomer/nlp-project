Item 9.
Regulation FD Disclosure.
Time Warner Inc. (the "Company") will present its Music segment results as a discontinued operation under generally accepted accounting principles beginning with its 2003 full year and fourth quarter earnings announcement on January 28, 2004. This presentation is based on the Company's disposal of its interests in its Music segment through the October 24, 2003 sale of Warner Music Group's ("WMG") CD and DVD manufacturing and distribution business, as well as the definitive agreement to sell WMG's recorded music and music publishing operations, which is expected to close shortly. This accounting treatment excludes the Music segment results from the presentation of continuing results for all periods presented.
The Company has furnished as an exhibit to this report historical financial and statistical information through September 30, 2003 updated to reflect the presentation of the Company's Music segment as a discontinued operation.
The information contained in Item 9 of this report, and in Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Company's filings with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1 TIME WARNER INC. 2003 TRENDING SCHEDULES BASIS OF PRESENTATION As a result of recent and pending transactions involving the Company's Music businesses, the results of the Music segment have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The Company utilizes Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. The Company also evaluates the performance of its businesses using Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization excluding the impact of non-cash impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and gains and losses on asset sales (referred to herein as Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization). Both Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company's businesses. Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Moreover, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization does not reflect the diminution in value of goodwill and intangible assets or gains and losses on asset sales. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets, the impact of related impairments, as well as asset sales through other financial measures such as capital expenditures, and investment spending and return on capital. The Company also utilizes Free Cash Flow to evaluate the performance of its businesses. Free Cash Flow is cash provided by continuing operations (as defined by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States) less capital expenditures and product development costs, principal payments on capital leases, dividends paid and partnership distributions, if any. Free Cash Flow is considered to be an important indicator of the Company's ability to reduce debt and make strategic investments. Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's Operating Income (Loss), Net Income (Loss) and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
