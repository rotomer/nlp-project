ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On September 27, 2004, Time Warner Inc. (the "Registrant") announced that Time Warner Cable Inc. ("Time Warner Cable") and Cable Holdco, Inc. ("Cable Holdco"), a newly formed subsidiary of Time Warner Cable, have entered into a Tolling and Optional Redemption Agreement, dated as of September 24, 2004 (the "Agreement"), with Comcast Corporation ("Comcast"), Comcast Cable Communications Holdings, Inc., MOC Holdco II, Inc., TWE Holdings I Trust and TWE Holdings II Trust (the "Comcast Trust"). Pursuant to the Agreement, an affiliate of Comcast has been granted the option (the "Option"), which can be exercised between December 1, 2004, and subject to certain conditions, April 1, 2005, to require Time Warner Cable to redeem a portion of the Time Warner Cable stock held by the Comcast Trust in exchange for 100% of the common stock of Cable Holdco. At the time of the exchange, Cable Holdco will own certain cable television systems (the "Transferred Systems") currently owned directly or indirectly by Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. ("TWE"), a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable, serving about 90,000 basic subscribers as of July 31, 2004, plus approximately $750 million in cash. Comcast currently owns an effective interest of approximately 21% in Time Warner Cable's business - held through a 17.9% common stock interest in Time Warner Cable and a 4.7% limited partnership interest in TWE. If the Option is exercised, Comcast will reduce its effective interest in Time Warner Cable's business to approximately 17% - consisting of a 13.7% common stock interest in Time Warner Cable and a 4.7% limited partnership interest in TWE. The Agreement also provides that the Comcast Trust will not exercise or pursue registration rights with respect to the Time Warner Cable stock owned by it until April 1, 2005 (or earlier if the Agreement is terminated under certain limited circumstances). In conjunction with the restructuring of TWE completed in 2003, the Comcast Trust received customary registration rights relating to its shares of common stock of Time Warner Cable. In December 2003, the Comcast Trust requested that Time Warner Cable register the common stock of Time Warner Cable it owned for sale in a public offering. The Agreement supersedes the Comcast Trust's previous request for registration. If the Option is exercised, the Registrant would account for the transaction as a sale of cable systems and a payment of $750 million in cash for the acquisition of a portion of Comcast's interest in Time Warner Cable. A gain or loss will be recognized based on the difference in the fair value of the cable systems transferred to Comcast and the Registrant's book basis in the Transferred Systems. In addition, the Registrant will apply purchase accounting to the portion of the interest acquired from Comcast.
Closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement is subject to exercise of the Option, required governmental and regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. A copy of the Agreement and the press release issued jointly by the Registrant and Comcast are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively. The Agreement is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibit 99.1: Tolling and Optional Redemption Agreement, dated as of September 24, 2004.

All insurance proceeds received or receivable in respect of any Assumed Liabilities, all insurance proceeds (to the extent not already expended by Time Warner Cable to restore or replace the lost or damaged asset, which replacement asset shall be a Transferred Asset) received or receivable in respect of any asset damaged or lost after June 30, 2004 and which if not so damaged or lost would have been a Transferred Asset and all insurance proceeds received or receivable in respect of business interruption of the Transferred Systems to the extent relating to any period after Closing, in each case on an effective after-tax basis;
23 in the case of each of the foregoing, if such property is owned, held for use, leased, licensed or used primarily in the operation of the Transferred Systems and then only to the extent of Time Warner Cable's and its Affiliates' right, title and interest therein. For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to Section 2.1(e), the parties intend that to the fullest extent permitted all record and beneficial ownership interests of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates in the Transferred Assets will be transferred to Holdco in the Holdco Transaction and if any Transferring Party holds beneficial ownership in assets of the type described above while another Transferring Party holds record ownership in such assets, all of such ownership interests would be transferred to Holdco in the Holdco Transaction. (d) EXCLUDED ASSETS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, all right, title and interest of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates in, to and under the following (collectively, the "EXCLUDED ASSETS"), in each case regardless of whether related to the Transferred Systems, shall not be transferred to Holdco pursuant to the Holdco Transaction and shall be retained directly or indirectly by Time Warner Cable from and after the Closing: (i) any and all cable programming services agreements (including cable guide contracts but excluding system specific programming agreements listed on SCHEDULE 2.1(C)(V)) and any payments received or to be received with respect thereto; (ii) any and all insurance policies and rights and claims thereunder other than the matters described in Section 2.1(c)(viii); (iii) letters of credit and any stocks, bonds (other than surety bonds), certificates of deposit and similar investments; any and all cash and cash equivalents (including cash received as advance payments by subscribers in the ordinary course of business and held by Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates as of the Closing Time, but excluding cash in an amount equal to the amount of cash received as subscriber deposits, the cash insurance proceeds described in Section 2.1(c)(viii), petty cash on-hand, if any, any cash referred to in Section 12.16, cash received as advance payments from subscribers that are not received in the ordinary course of business and the Cash Amount); (v) any and all patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, service marks, service names, logos and similar proprietary rights, including the "Time Warner Cable" name and any derivations thereof (subject to Section 3.2, excluding those items owned, licensed, used or held for use exclusively in connection with the operation of the Transferred Systems); (vi) any and all Contracts for Subscriber billing services and any equipment leased with respect to the provision of services under such contracts (subject to Section 7.9); (vii) any and all Contracts relating to national advertising sales representation; (viii) any and all agreements with Road Runner Holdco LLC or any other Internet service provider; (ix) any and all Contracts pursuant to which Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates procures goods or service for the Transferred Systems and the Time Warner Cable Retained Cable Systems; (x) any and all retransmission consent agreements, except as provided in Section 7.5 with respect to certain Local Retransmission Consent Agreements as elected by Comcast Subsidiary; (xi) any and all agreements governing or evidencing an obligation of Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates for borrowed money; (xii) the assets described on SCHEDULE 2.1(D); (xiii) any surplus inventory in excess of amounts of inventory held consistent with Specified Division practice; (xiv) any and all licenses to provide telephony service held, directly or indirectly, by Time

(e) AUTHORIZATIONS AND CONSENTS. (i) If and to the extent that the transfer or assignment from TWE to Time Warner Cable or from Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates to Holdco of any Transferred Asset (or following such transfer or assignment, the transfer of Holdco Shares to Comcast Trust or Comcast Subsidiary, or from Comcast Trust to Comcast Subsidiary, as the case may be) would be a violation of applicable Legal Requirements with respect to such Transferred Asset, require any Authorization with respect to such Transferred Asset or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the applicable transferee thereunder then the transfer or assignment to Time Warner Cable or Holdco, as applicable, of such Transferred Asset (each a "DELAYED TRANSFER ASSET") shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed and/or such Authorizations have been made or obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Delayed Transfer Asset shall be deemed a Transferred Asset for purposes of determining whether any Liability is an Assumed Liability. (ii) If the transfer or assignment of any Transferred Asset intended to be transferred or assigned hereunder is not consummated prior to or at the Closing, whether as a result of the provisions of Section 2.1(e) or for any other reason, then Time Warner Cable (or its Affiliate) shall thereafter, directly or indirectly, hold such Transferred Asset for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably possible and not prohibited under the terms of any applicable Contract, of Holdco (at the expense of Holdco). In addition, Time Warner Cable shall take or cause to be taken such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Holdco in order to place Holdco, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such Transferred Asset had been transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Transferred Assets including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and
25 dominion, control and command over such Transferred Asset, are to inure from and after the Closing to Holdco. To the extent permitted by Legal Requirements and to the extent otherwise permissible in light of any required Authorization, Holdco shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the management of any Transferred Assets not yet transferred to it as a result of this Section 2.1(e) and the parties agree to use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate and coordinate with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, Time Warner Cable will cause TWE and each other Transferring Person to comply with the provisions hereof as if TWE or such other Transferring Person were a party hereto to the extent any Transferred Asset was intended to be, but was not, transferred in the TWE Redemption or the Holdco Transaction, as applicable. (iii) If and when the Authorizations, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Transferred Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1(e), are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Transferred Asset to Holdco shall automatically and without further action be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Transaction Documents. (iv) Neither Time Warner Cable nor any Affiliate thereof shall be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced by Holdco, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by Holdco except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, including for this purpose Section 3.4. (v) Prior to the Holdco Transaction, Time Warner Cable shall deliver to Holdco a list identifying, in reasonable detail and to Time Warner Cable's knowledge, the Delayed Transfer Assets and the Authorizations required therefor. (vi) The parties hereto further agree (A) that any Delayed Transferred Assets referred to in this Section 2.1(e) shall be treated for all Income Tax purposes as assets of Holdco and (B) not to report or take any Tax position (on a Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest, provided that if such a resolution would result in Time Warner Cable taking a position that is inconsistent with any reporting position required to be taken under the Tax Matters Agreement the provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement shall apply). Section 2.2 ASSUMED LIABILITIES. At the Closing and except as otherwise provided for herein, Holdco shall assume, and, from and after the Closing, Holdco shall pay, discharge and perform as and when due, all (a) Liabilities of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates to the extent arising out of, resulting from or associated with the ownership and operation of the Transferred Assets and/or the Transferred Business prior to Closing, including all Master Pre-Closing Liabilities, (b) all Liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from the ownership and operation of the Transferred Assets and/or the Transferred Business after the Closing, including all Specified Launch Support Liabilities, and (c) the Holdco Transaction Liabilities (clauses
26 (a), (b) and (c) collectively, the "ASSUMED LIABILITIES"). The Assumed Liabilities shall not include Excluded Tax Liabilities, (ii) Liabilities set forth on SCHEDULE 2.2, (iii) Liabilities for long-term debt (including the current portion thereof), (iv) Liabilities to the extent arising out of, resulting from or associated with the use, ownership or operation of the Excluded Assets other than Master Pre-Closing Liabilities and Specified Launch Support Liabilities, any Liabilities of Time Warner Cable or its Affiliates other than Assumed Liabilities, (vi) any Liabilities of the type that would be excluded from financial statements by reason of the GAAP Adjustments or any intercompany payable created to record cash lent to the Transferred Systems prior to Closing (clauses (i) through (vii) collectively, "EXCLUDED LIABILITIES"). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) any Liability specifically allocated to Holdco pursuant to another provision of this Agreement shall be an Assumed Liability rather than an Excluded Liability and (y) any Liability specifically allocated to Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates (other than Holdco) pursuant to another provision of this Agreement shall be an Excluded Liability rather than an Assumed Liability. Section 2.3 REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT. (a) Comcast Trust and Time Warner Cable each hereby acknowledge and agree that any request by Comcast Trust for a demand registration under the Registration Rights Agreement prior to the date hereof (the "PREVIOUS REQUEST") will be treated for all purposes as if it had not been made. Unless and until a subsequent request for a demand registration is delivered after the Tolling Termination Date to Time Warner Cable in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement, Time Warner Cable will not be required to take any action under the Registration Rights Agreement in respect of any request for a demand registration thereunder. (b) Comcast Trust hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Controlled Affiliates that it shall not exercise (or cause to be exercised) (or make any request with respect thereto) any of its demand registration rights under the Registration Rights Agreement with respect to any "Registrable Securities" (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) beneficially owned by it or any of its Controlled Affiliates or otherwise until after the Tolling Termination Date. The foregoing shall be deemed to amend, modify and supplement the Registration Rights Agreement; PROVIDED, that, it is acknowledged and agreed by Time Warner Cable that nothing contained in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed a revocation by Comcast Trust for purposes of Section 4.1(c) of the Registration Rights Agreement. (c) Comcast Trust hereby agrees that it will not from and after the date hereof until the Tolling Termination Date transfer or otherwise dispose of any Registrable Securities to any Person unless prior to such transfer or disposition (and as a condition thereto) such Person agrees in writing to be bound by this Section 2.3 as if a party hereto and delivers a written acknowledgment of the same to Time Warner Cable (including with respect to any subsequent transfers or dispositions).
27 (d) In its capacity as the ultimate indirect beneficiary of the Comcast Trust, Comcast Parent hereby expressly acknowledges and approves of the agreement made by Comcast Trust in this Section 2.3. Section 2.4 ESTIMATED CLOSING ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT. No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Time Warner Cable will deliver to Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary a good faith estimate of the Subscriber Adjustment Amount (the "ESTIMATED SUBSCRIBER ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT"), if any, and a good faith estimate of the Closing Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING NET LIABILITIES ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT"), if any, together with appropriate documentation supporting such estimates. The sum of the Estimated Subscriber Adjustment Amount and the Estimated Closing Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount is referred to herein as the "ESTIMATED CLOSING ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" and may be a positive or a negative amount. Section 2.5 FINAL-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT. (a) No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date (the "DELIVERY DATE"), Comcast Subsidiary will deliver to Time Warner Cable (A) its determination of the Closing Net Liabilities Amount for Holdco and based on the foregoing, the Closing Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount, (B) its determination of the Transferred Closing Subscriber Number and the Transferred Base Subscriber Number and (C) appropriate documentation supporting such determinations (the "COMCAST CERTIFICATE") and Time Warner Cable will deliver to Comcast Subsidiary (A) its determination of the Retained Closing Subscriber Number and the Retained Base Subscriber Number and (B) appropriate documentation supporting such determinations (the "TIME WARNER CABLE CERTIFICATE"). (b) If Time Warner Cable disagrees with any item in the Comcast Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(i), Time Warner Cable may, within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Delivery Date, deliver a notice to Comcast Subsidiary disagreeing with such item and setting forth Time Warner Cable's calculation of such item, together with appropriate documentation supporting such determination. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or portions thereof as to which Time Warner Cable disagrees, and Time Warner Cable shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and portions of items contained in the Comcast Certificate delivered to it pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(i). If Comcast Subsidiary disagrees with any item in the Time Warner Cable Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(ii), Comcast Subsidiary may, within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Delivery Date, deliver a notice to Time Warner Cable disagreeing with such item and setting forth Time Warner Cable's calculation of such item, together with appropriate documentation supporting such determination. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or portions thereof as to which Comcast Subsidiary disagrees, and Comcast Subsidiary shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and portions of items contained in the Time Warner Cable Certificate delivered to it pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(ii).
28 (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(b), Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts. If during such period, Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly jointly retain a nationally recognized accounting firm that is not the principal independent accountant of either Comcast Parent or Time Warner Cable's ultimate parent (the "ACCOUNTING REFEREE") to resolve the disputed items or amounts. In making its determinations of the propriety of items and amounts, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items (or portions thereof) or amounts as to which Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary disagree and, with respect to each item (or portion thereof) or amount, shall select a number within the range of the dispute between Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary, as promptly as practicable (but, in any event, within thirty (30) days after submission of the dispute to it), a report setting forth its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and based thereon (and on the items (or portions thereof) and amounts not in dispute) the Closing Adjustment Amount. Such report shall be final and binding upon Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary. The costs of the Accounting Referee shall be shared equally by Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary. Holdco and Time Warner Cable will, and will cause their Affiliates and independent accountants to, cooperate and assist each other and the Accounting Referee in conducting their respective reviews of the amounts referred to in this Section 2.5, including without limitation, making available to the extent necessary any books, records, work papers and personnel. (d) As used herein, the term "FINAL CLOSING ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" means, with respect to any determination of the Closing Adjustment Amount (as defined below): (1) if no notice of disagreement is delivered by either party in accordance with Section 2.5(b) with respect to the other party's determination of an element used to calculated the Closing Adjustment Amount, the Closing Adjustment Amount calculated based on the amounts in the Comcast Certificate and the Time Warner Cable Certificate; (2) if either party delivers a notice of disagreement in accordance with Section 2.5(b) and the parties reach agreement on all disputed items within 30 days following such delivery, the Closing Adjustment Amount as determined in accordance with such agreement; or (3) if either party delivers a notice of disagreement in accordance with Section 2.5(b) and the parties fail to reach agreement within 30 days, the Closing Adjustment Amount as calculated based on the undisputed amounts in the Comcast Certificate and Time Warner Cable Certificate and with respect to disputed items, as determined by the Accounting Referee. As used herein, the term "CLOSING ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" means the sum of the Subscriber Adjustment Amount and the Closing Net Liabilities Amount. (e) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount, Time Warner Cable will pay to Holdco the amount of such excess. If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Closing Adjustment Amount, Holdco will pay to Time Warner Cable the amount of such excess. Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.5(e) shall be made at a mutually
29 convenient time and place within three (3) days after the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.5(e) shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to and including the date of payment at the Base Interest Rate. (f) TAX TREATMENT OF ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS AND INTEREST. (i) For all Tax purposes (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest) the parties hereto agree to treat and to cause their respective Affiliates to treat any payment pursuant to Section 2.5(e) to Holdco by Time Warner Cable (a "TIME WARNER CABLE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT") or to Time Warner Cable by Holdco (a "HOLDCO ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT" and, each, an "ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT") as (x) with respect to a Time Warner Cable Adjustment Payment, a contribution by Time Warner Cable to Holdco occurring immediately prior to the Closing, and (y) with respect to a Holdco Adjustment Payment, an adjustment to the cash transferred by Time Warner Cable to Holdco pursuant to the Holdco Transaction occurring immediately prior to the Closing. (ii) Notwithstanding Section 2.5(f)(i) above, any Adjustment Payments that represent interest payable under Section 2.5(e) hereof shall be treated for all Tax purposes (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest), as (1) deductible to the payor and (2) taxable to the payee. (g) As used herein, the term "CLOSING NET LIABILITIES ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" means the excess, if any, of the Closing Net Liabilities Amount over $10,000,000. The "CLOSING NET LIABILITIES AMOUNT" shall equal the amount of all Liabilities of Holdco as of the Closing (other than the Holdco Transaction Liabilities), less the amount of all current assets (other than inventory and the Cash Amount) of Holdco as of the Closing, in each case as would be reflected on the face of a balance sheet (excluding any footnotes thereto) prepared in accordance with GAAP and the GAAP Adjustments; PROVIDED that, if Comcast Subsidiary or its Affiliate shall have made the request referred to in Section 3.1(g)(v), the Actuarial Amount shall be treated as a Liability for purposes of this calculation. Current assets shall include, but shall not be limited to, all cash and cash equivalents (other than the Cash Amount), prepaid expenses, funds on deposit with third parties, and accounts receivable other than (i) the portion of any account receivable resulting from cable, telephony, data or Internet service sales that is sixty (60) days or more past due as of the Closing Date, (ii) the portion of any national agency account receivable resulting from advertising sales that is one hundred and twenty (120) days or more past due as of the Closing Date, (iii) any non-national agency account receivable resulting from advertising sales any portion of which is ninety (90) days or more past due as of the Closing Date, (iv) accounts receivable from customers whose accounts are inactive as of the Closing Date or (v) any accounts receivable that have not arisen from a bona fide transaction in the ordinary course of business. For purposes of making the foregoing "past due" calculations, the billing statements of a Transferred System will be deemed to be due and payable consistent with ordinary accounting practice. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, Liabilities shall include, but shall not be limited to, the Actuarial Amount (if Comcast Subsidiary or its Affiliate shall have
30 made the request referred to in Section 3.1(g)(v)), Specified Launch Support Liabilities, accounts payable, accrued expenses (including all accrued vacation time, sick days, paid time off, copyright fees, programming expenses, Applicable Taxes, franchise fees and other license fees or charges), capitalized lease obligations, Liabilities with respect to unearned income and advance payments (including subscriber prepayments and deposits for converters, encoders, cable television service and related sales) and interest, if any, required to be paid on advance payments. (h) "SUBSCRIBER ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" means an amount (which may be positive or negative) equal to the product of (x) $3,500 times (y) the Relative Percentage Amount times (z) the Transferred Base Subscriber Number. As used herein, the term "RELATIVE PERCENTAGE AMOUNT" means an amount (which shall be expressed as a percentage and may be positive or negative) equal to (i) the Retained Percentage (as defined below) minus (ii) the Transferred Percentage (as defined below). As used herein, the term "RETAINED PERCENTAGE" means a fraction (expressed as a percentage) the numerator of which is the number of Individual Subscribers of the Time Warner Cable Retained Cable Systems as of the Closing Date (the "RETAINED CLOSING SUBSCRIBER NUMBER") and the denominator of which is the number of Individual Subscribers of the Time Warner Cable Retained Cable Systems as of July 31, 2004 (the "RETAINED BASE SUBSCRIBER NUMBER"). As used herein, the term "TRANSFERRED PERCENTAGE" means a fraction (expressed as a percentage) the numerator of which is the number of Individual Subscribers of the Transferred Systems as of the Closing Date (the "TRANSFERRED CLOSING SUBSCRIBER NUMBER") and the denominator of which is the number of Individual Subscribers of such Transferred Systems as of July 31, 2004 (the "TRANSFERRED BASE SUBSCRIBER Number"). ARTICLE 3 RELATED MATTERS Section 3.1 EMPLOYEES. (a) EMPLOYEES. Each Transferred System Employee who is an employee of Time Warner Cable or one of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Holdco Transaction, including individuals on leave of absence, short-term disability and long-term disability, shall become employees of Holdco as of the consummation of the Holdco Transaction. Employees who commence employment with Holdco in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be referred to herein as "Comcast Transferred System Employees." Holdco (or its Affiliates as of the Closing) shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to effectuate the transfer of employment described in this Section 3.1(a), including, without limitation, making a general offer of employment to each such Transferred System Employee. The parties hereto shall not take any action that would interfere with such employees becoming employed by Holdco as of the consummation of the Holdco Transaction. Immediately following the Closing, Comcast shall cause the Comcast Transferred System Employees to be paid base salary rates no less than those rates provided to such employees immediately prior to the consummation of the Holdco Transaction and to be provided benefit plan participation at levels no less favorable than those applicable to similarly situated employees of Comcast Subsidiary or its Affiliates at
31 the time of the Closing. As of the Closing, Holdco shall employ no individuals other than employees who are primarily employed in connection with the Transferred Systems. (i) Holdco shall recognize, as to each Comcast Transferred System Employee, the period of service (without duplication of benefits) with Time Warner Cable and any of its Affiliates (other than Holdco) prior to the Closing under all Time Warner Cable Benefit Plans to the extent so recognized by Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates prior to the Holdco Transaction. In addition, Holdco shall recognize, as to each Comcast Transferred System Employee, all vacation, sick leave and paid time off accrued by such Comcast Transferred System Employee but unused as of the consummation of the Holdco Transaction. (ii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that, except to the extent used in connection with the funding of any Time Warner Cable Benefit Plan that is continued by Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates (other than Holdco), as of the consummation of the Holdco Transaction the parties hereto shall cause to be transferred to or held for the benefit of Holdco their interests in all life, medical and other insurance policies to the extent relating to Transferred System Employees. (iii) Subject to obtaining any necessary consents and except as provided in Section 7.2(h) or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, as of the consummation of the Holdco Transaction, Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates (other than Holdco) shall assign to, and Holdco shall assume, (A) all rights, obligations and Liabilities of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates (other than Holdco) (x) under all employment agreements, unfunded compensation arrangements and employee related insurance policies and (y) for benefits accrued and payable now and in the future under all Time Warner Cable Benefit Plans, and (B) all other employment-related rights, obligations and Liabilities, in each case to the extent relating to Transferred System Employees (other than Liabilities relating to or arising under the "Time Warner Cable 401(k) Plan" and the "Time Warner Cable Pension Plans" (each as defined below)) (such Liabilities shall be included in the meaning of Assumed Liabilities). (iv) The parties hereto agree that, except to the extent that sponsorship of a funded Time Warner Cable Benefit Plan is continued by Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates (other than Holdco) and except as provided in Section 7.2(h) or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Transferred Assets shall include any monies, contracts or other funds relating to the participation of any Transferred System Employees in any Time Warner Cable Benefit Plan. (v) Subject to any required notification, as of the consummation of the Holdco Transaction, the parties agree to take such action, and to cause their Affiliates to take such action, as is necessary to cause Holdco to succeed to the rights and obligations of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates (other than Holdco), including its rights and obligations with respect to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), under any collective bargaining agreement (if any so exist) to the extent such agreement covers Transferred System Employees.
32 (b) CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT WITH HOLDCO(i). Effective as of the Closing, all Comcast Transferred System Employees shall continue to be employees of Holdco and shall cease to be employees of Time Warner Cable or any of its Subsidiaries. Effective as of the Closing, Time Warner Cable shall discontinue providing benefits to Transferred System Employees under all Time Warner Cable Benefit Plans except as otherwise required by law or as contemplated under this Agreement. (c) SEVERANCE-RELATED LIABILITIES. Comcast Subsidiary and Holdco shall be responsible for all Liabilities with respect to any Transferred System Employee in connection with the termination of such employee's employment with Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates, including, without limitation, Liability for severance payments and benefits under the TWC Severance Pay Plan or any individual employment or severance arrangement, each, in accordance with its terms, applicable to a Transferred System Employee who rejects the general offer of employment made pursuant to Section 3.1(a) or experiences a termination of employment with Holdco or any of its Affiliates at any time on or after the consummation of the Holdco Transaction, and any Liability under WARN, as applicable other than any Liabilities with respect to the termination of employment of the employee listed on Schedule 3.1(l)(i), if such employee is hired by Tiger Cable or any of its Affiliates as permitted by Section 3.1(l) in the 12 month period following the Closing. (d) PARTICIPATION IN BENEFIT PLANS. With respect to Comcast Transferred System Employees, compensation and service of such employees with Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates prior to Closing shall be recognized under all applicable Comcast Benefit Plans to the extent so recognized under the corresponding Time Warner Cable Benefit Plans prior to Closing, except to the extent that duplication of benefits would result or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. (e) TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. As of and following the Closing, Transferred System Employees shall not be entitled to make contributions to or to benefit from matching or other contributions under the TWC Savings Plan ("TIME WARNER CABLE 401(K) PLAN"). None of Comcast Subsidiary, any of its Affiliates or Holdco shall have any Liability with respect to the Time Warner Cable 401(k) Plan, except as may be provided in any other agreement between Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Comcast Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates (other than Holdco), on the other. Comcast Transferred System Employees who were participants in the Time Warner Cable 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing shall become participants in a defined contribution pension plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code and meeting the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code established or maintained by Comcast Subsidiary or its Affiliates (the "COMCAST 401(K) PLAN") as of the Closing; PROVIDED that any Comcast Transferred System Employee with less than 6 months of service with Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to Closing will only become a participant in the Comcast 401(k) Plan after accruing 6 months of combined continuous service with Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates (other than Holdco) and Holdco or any of its Affiliates (other than Time Warner Cable).
33 (f) TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS. As of the Closing, the Transferred System Employees shall cease accruing benefits under the Time Warner Cable Pension Plan and the Time Warner Cable Union Pension Plan (collectively, the "TIME WARNER CABLE PENSION PLANS"). None of Comcast Subsidiary, any of its Affiliates or Holdco shall have any Liability with respect to the Time Warner Cable Pension Plans, except as may be provided in any other agreement between Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Comcast Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates (other than Holdco), on the other. (g) HEALTH AND WELFARE PLANS. (i) All Liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from health and welfare coverage or claims incurred by or on behalf of each Transferred System Employee under any Time Warner Cable Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (each a "TIME WARNER CABLE HEALTH OR WELFARE PLAN") shall be Liabilities of Comcast Subsidiary or one of its Affiliates. (ii) Other than as required by COBRA, each Transferred System Employee shall cease to participate in any Time Warner Cable Health or Welfare Plan as of the Closing. (iii) Each Comcast Transferred System Employee who, after the recognition of service provided for in Section 3.1(d) satisfies the eligibility requirements under the applicable Comcast Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (each, a "COMCAST HEALTH OR WELFARE PLAN"), shall be (A) entitled to enroll, effective as of the Closing, as a newly-eligible employee of Comcast Subsidiary or one of its Affiliates in the Comcast Health or Welfare Plans then available to similarly situated employees of Comcast Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates and (B) eligible to elect such coverages and benefit options as may then be available or provided under the terms of the Comcast Health or Welfare Plans to new employees of Comcast Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates. All compensation, benefit elections, deductible payments, payments toward the applicable out-of-pocket maximums and other benefit-affecting determinations affecting Comcast Transferred System Employees that, as of immediately prior to the Closing, were recognized under any Time Warner Cable Health or Welfare Plan with respect to the plan year in which the Closing occurs shall receive full recognition, credit and validity and be taken into account under the corresponding Comcast Health or Welfare Plan as of the Closing with respect to that same plan year.

Section 7.3 CERTAIN ADDITIONAL COVENANTS REGARDING REQUIRED CONSENTS; HSR ACT FILING. (a) By no later than 15 Business Days after the Option Exercise Date, Comcast Trust, Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable shall provide each other with all necessary documentation to allow filing of FCC Forms 394 with respect to the Transferred Systems Franchises. Comcast Trust, Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another and file with the applicable Governmental Authority FCC Forms 394 for each of the Transferred System Franchises which requires the consent of such Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no later than 20 Business Days after the Option Exercise Date. (b) Subject to Section 7.1(h), from and after the Option Exercise Date, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in obtaining the Time Warner Cable Required Consents and any other consent, Authorization or approval, including with the relevant franchising authorities in respect of the Transferred Systems Franchises, necessary or commercially advisable with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder including, to the extent commercially reasonable, the attendance of representatives of Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary at meetings and hearings before applicable Governmental Authorities in connection with the transfer of any Transferred Systems License or Transferred Systems Franchise and by
60 providing appropriate financial statements, insurance certificates and surety bonds required to obtain such Time Warner Cable Required Consents. (c) The parties shall as soon as practicable after the Option Exercise Date, but in any event no later than 30 days after the Option Exercise Date, complete and file, or cause to be completed and filed, any notification and report required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each such filing shall request early termination of the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests received from a Governmental Authority for additional information or documentation and in connection with antitrust matters. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome any objections which may be raised by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over antitrust matters. Each party shall cooperate to prevent inconsistencies between their respective filings and between their respective responses to all such inquiries and requests, and shall furnish to each other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions under the HSR Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in the Agreement to the contrary, neither party shall be required to enter into any consent decree with any Governmental Authority relating to antitrust matters or to sell or hold separate any assets or make any change in operations or activities of the business (or any material assets employed therein) of such party or its Affiliates, if a party determines in good faith that such change would be adverse to the operations or activities of the business (or any material assets employed therein) of such party or any of its Affiliates having significant assets, net worth or revenue. The cost of any filing fees in connection with any required filing pursuant to the HSR Act shall be borne equally by Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable. (d) The parties understand and agree that as part of the FCC Trust Requirements the declaration of trust of Comcast Trust may be required to be amended in order to permit the TWC Redemption or the Comcast Subsidiary Transfer, and any such amendment would require approval of the FCC. If such amendment is required, Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approval prior to Closing, and if such approval is obtained, Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary will amend the declaration of trust of Comcast Trust to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 7.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY. (a) Unless and until Closing occurs, any non-public information that any party may obtain from the other in connection with this Agreement shall be confidential, and following Closing, each party shall keep confidential any non-public information that such party may receive from another party in connection with this Agreement unrelated to the Transferred Systems or Transferred Assets and Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates shall keep confidential any non-public information in their possession related to the Transferred Systems and Transferred Assets (any such information that a party is required to keep confidential pursuant to this sentence shall be
61 referred to as "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"). No party shall disclose any Confidential Information to any other Person (other than its Affiliates and its Affiliates' directors, officers and employees, and representatives of its advisers and lenders, in each case, whose knowledge thereof is necessary in order to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, in which case such party shall be responsible for any breach by any such Person) or use such information to the detriment of the other; PROVIDED, that (i) such party may use and disclose any such information once it has been publicly disclosed (other than by such party in breach of its obligations under this Section) or which, to its knowledge, rightfully has come into the possession of such party (other than from the other party), and (ii) to the extent that such party may, in the reasonable judgment of its counsel, be compelled by Legal Requirements to disclose any of such information, such party may disclose such information if it has used commercially reasonable efforts, and has afforded the other the opportunity, to obtain an appropriate protective order, or other satisfactory assurance of confidential treatment, for the information compelled to be disclosed and (iii) such party may use and disclose such information to the extent reasonably necessary to permit such party to file Tax Returns, defend any dispute relating to Taxes, claim any Refund or otherwise provide information to a Governmental Authority in connection with any other Tax Proceeding and (iv) such party may use and disclose such information to the extent necessary to comply with Legal Requirements or any periodic reporting obligations such party may have by virtue of such party or any of its Affiliates having securities listed on a national securities exchange or quotation system. In the event of termination of this Agreement, (A) the obligation set forth in this Section shall continue for a period of two years after such termination, and (B) each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the other, and to retain no copies of, any documents, work papers or other materials obtained by such party or on its behalf from the other, whether so obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Comcast Trust may disclose any Confidential Information to Comcast Subsidiary and its Affiliates and their respective representatives. (b) Each of the parties hereto shall consult with and cooperate with the other with respect to the content and timing of all press releases and other public announcements, and any oral or written statements to Transferred System Employees concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements or by any national securities exchange or quotation system, no party hereto shall make any such release, announcement or statement without the prior written consent and approval of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The party receiving a request for a consent shall respond promptly to any such request for consent and approval. Section 7.5 RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AGREEMENTS. On or prior to the date which is 30 days prior to the anticipated date of Closing, Time Warner Cable shall deliver to Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary a list of all Local Retransmission Consent Agreements then in effect with respect to the Transferred Systems. By written notice delivered to Time Warner Cable at least 15 days prior to Closing, Comcast Subsidiary may, in its sole discretion, elect to have Holdco assume one or more of the Local Retransmission Consent Agreements, in which case Time Warner Cable shall use
62 commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required Authorizations for such assumption. The foregoing shall be subject to Section 2.1(e) to the extent any related Authorization is not obtained. Any Local Retransmission Consent Agreements which Comcast Subsidiary elects to have Holdco assume pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be included in the Transferred Assets. To the extent the provisions of this Section 7.5 conflict with any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 7.5 shall control. Section 7.6 TITLE INSURANCE COMMITMENTS. Time Warner Cable shall provide to Comcast Subsidiary, within 90 days from the Option Exercise Date, or, in the case of any Survey, such longer period of time as is necessary to obtain such Survey with the exercise of reasonable diligence, (a) commitments to issue to Holdco title insurance policies ("TITLE COMMITMENTS") in amounts reasonably satisfactory to Comcast Subsidiary issued by a nationally recognized title insurance company (a "TITLE COMPANY") and containing, to the extent available, legible photocopies of all recorded items described as exceptions therein, committing to insure fee or a valid leasehold title, as applicable, in Holdco to each parcel of Owned Property or Leased Property designated by Comcast Subsidiary in the Option Exercise Notice by ALTA extended coverage owner's or leasehold policies of title insurance, or, if ALTA policies are not obtainable in any state, policies in another form reasonably satisfactory to Comcast Subsidiary, and (b) surveys of each parcel of Owned Property or Leased Property designated by Comcast Subsidiary in the Option Exercise Notice ("SURVEYS"), in such form as is reasonably necessary to obtain the title insurance to be issued pursuant to the related Title Commitments with the standard printed exceptions relating to survey matters deleted, certified to Holdco, Comcast Subsidiary and to the Title Company with respect to that Owned Property or Leased Property. In no event shall Time Warner Cable be obligated to procure a Title Commitment for any Leased Property with respect to which the Lease or a memorandum thereof has not been recorded in the land records of the county in which the Leased Property is located. The cost to obtain such Title Commitments and Surveys and other documents required by the Title Company to issue such policies and Surveys, as well as the cost of title policy premiums, shall be borne by Comcast Subsidiary. If Comcast Subsidiary notifies Time Warner Cable within 30 days following delivery to Comcast Subsidiary of both the Title Commitments and the Surveys of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien or a Lien set forth in SCHEDULE 6.4(a)) which prevents access to or which could prevent or impede in any material way the use or operation of any parcel of Owned Property or Leased Property for which a Title Commitment is required pursuant to this Section 7.6 for the purposes for which it is currently used or operated by Time Warner Cable (each a "TITLE DEFECT"), Time Warner Cable shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts, including paying attorney and other incidental costs associated with any such efforts, to (i) remove such Title Defect, or (ii) cause the Title Company to commit to insure over each such Title Defect prior to Closing. If such Title Defect cannot be removed prior to Closing or the Title Company does not commit to insure over such Title Defect prior to Closing and if acceptable to Comcast Subsidiary in its reasonable discretion, Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable shall enter into a written agreement containing Time Warner Cable's commitment to use commercially reasonable efforts for 180 days following Closing to remedy the Title Defect following
63 Closing on terms satisfactory to Comcast Subsidiary, in its reasonable discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Time Warner Cable be required to remove any Liens encumbering the Owned Property and Leased Property except as expressly set forth in this Section 7.6, and in no event shall Time Warner Cable be obligated to commence any Litigation to cause any Title Defects to be deleted. Section 7.7 2005 BUDGETS. Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable shall use good faith efforts to mutually agree on the 2005 Budgets prior to December 31, 2004. If by December 31, 2004 Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable shall not have mutually agreed on the 2005 Budgets, Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable shall continue to work together in good faith to mutually agree on the 2005 Budgets; PROVIDED, that until the earlier of (i) Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable agreeing on the 2005 Budgets and (ii) the Closing, the 2005 Budgets shall determined as follows: (a) the 2004 Operating Budget shall be considered as the 2005 Operating Budget, PROVIDED that all operating expenses provided therein shall be increased by 5%; and (b) the 2005 Capital Budget shall be determined by Time Warner Cable in good faith subject to the following conditions: (i) with respect to the Transferred Systems other than the system identified on SCHEDULE 7.7(B), the 2005 Capital Budget shall provide for aggregate expenditures of not less than the aggregate expenditures provided for in the 2004 Capital Budget (in each case, excluding the telephony budgets included therein); (ii) with respect to the system identified on SCHEDULE 7.7(B), the 2005 Capital Budget shall provide for aggregate expenditures of not less than 80% of the aggregate expenditures provided for in the 2004 Capital Budget (in each case, excluding the telephony budgets included therein); and, (iii) the telephony budgets included in the 2005 Capital Budget shall be determined based on a non-discriminatory allocation of the telephony budget of the applicable division of Time Warner Cable to the relevant Transferred Systems. Section 7.8 POST-CLOSING OBTAINING OF CONSENTS. Subsequent to Closing, and subject to Section 2.1(e), Time Warner Cable shall and shall cause its Affiliates to continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain in writing as promptly as possible any Authorization necessary or commercially advisable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder which was not obtained on or before Closing (a "POST-CLOSING CONSENT") in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Comcast Subsidiary. A true and complete copy of any such Post-Closing Consent shall be delivered to each of Comcast Subsidiary and Holdco promptly after it has been obtained.
64 Section 7.9 TRANSITIONAL SERVICES. (a) Time Warner Cable shall provide to Holdco, upon written request from Comcast Subsidiary received by Time Warner Cable no later than 30 days prior to the anticipated date of Closing, Subscriber billing services, high speed data, telephony, and such other services as may be reasonably requested by Comcast Subsidiary in connection with the operation of the Transferred Systems for a commercially reasonable period following Closing to be mutually agreed upon in good faith by Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary to allow for conversion of existing or replacement services ("TRANSITIONAL SERVICES"). Holdco shall promptly reimburse Time Warner Cable for the actual out-of-pocket cost to Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates of providing any Transitional Services. All other terms and conditions for the provision of Transitional Services shall be reasonably satisfactory to both Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable and subject to applicable Legal Requirements. (b) Time Warner Cable will, at its expense, rebuild the "HITS" headend for the Transferred System identified on SCHEDULE 7.9 on or before the Closing and, after Closing, Time Warner Cable may, at its option, lease space from Holdco such that Time Warner Cable will continue to have access to a hubsite to be located on properties included in such system, all on terms mutually satisfactory to Time Warner Cable and Comcast Subsidiary to be negotiated in good faith prior to the Closing. Section 7.10 COOPERATION UPON INQUIRIES AS TO RATES. Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable agree as follows: (a) For a period of 12 months after Closing, Time Warner Cable shall cooperate with and assist Holdco by providing, upon request, all information in Time Warner Cable's or its Affiliates' possession (and not previously provided to Comcast Subsidiary or Holdco) relating directly to the rates set forth in SCHEDULE 6.8 or the then current rates with respect to any Transferred System, if different from the rates set forth on such Schedule, or the rates on any FCC Form 393, 1200, 1205, 1210, 1220, 1235, or 1240 that Holdco may reasonably require to justify such rates in response to any inquiry, order or requirement of any Governmental Authority or any Rate Regulatory Matter instituted before or after the date of this Agreement. (b) If at any time prior to Closing, any Governmental Authority commences a Rate Regulatory Matter with respect to a Transferred System, Time Warner Cable shall (i) promptly notify Comcast Subsidiary, and (ii) keep Comcast Subsidiary informed as to the progress of any such proceeding. Without the prior consent of Comcast Subsidiary (after the Good Faith Notice Date), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Time Warner Cable shall not settle any such Rate Regulatory Matter, either before or after Closing, if (A) Holdco would have any obligation under such settlement, or (B) such settlement would reduce the rates permitted to be charged by Holdco after Closing below the rates set forth on SCHEDULE 6.8 or otherwise then in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, after Closing, Holdco shall have the right, at its own expense, to assume control of the defense of any pending Rate Regulatory Matter, to the extent, and only to the extent, that it relates to a
65 Transferred System. If Holdco elects to assume control of the defense of any such Rate Regulatory Matter, Time Warner Cable shall have the right to participate, at its expense, in the defense of such matter. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Article 11 of this Agreement, Holdco may settle any such Rate Regulatory Matter only upon Time Warner Cable's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if Time Warner Cable would have any obligation with respect to such settlement in accordance with Article 11 hereof or otherwise. (c) If at any time after Closing, any Governmental Authority commences a Rate Regulatory Matter with respect to a Transferred System involving any time period prior to Closing, Comcast Subsidiary shall cause Holdco to (i) promptly notify Time Warner Cable, and (ii) keep Time Warner Cable informed as to the progress of any such proceeding. Time Warner Cable shall have the right to participate, at its expense, in the defense of such matter. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Article 11 of this Agreement, Holdco may settle any such Rate Regulatory Matter only upon Time Warner Cable's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if Time Warner Cable would have any obligation with respect to such settlement in accordance with Article 11 hereof or otherwise. (d) For purposes hereof, "RATE REGULATORY MATTER" means any proceeding or investigation with respect to a Transferred System arising out of or related to the Cable Act (other than those affecting the cable television industry generally) dealing with, limiting or affecting the rates which can be charged by such Transferred System for programming, equipment, installation, service or otherwise. (e) If Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates is required following Closing pursuant to any Rate Regulatory Matter or any other Legal Requirement, settlement or otherwise to reimburse any Subscribers for any Subscriber payments previously made by it, including fees for cable television service, late fees and similar payments, Comcast Subsidiary shall cause Holdco, at Time Warner Cable's request, to make such reimbursement through Holdco's billing system on terms specified by Comcast Subsidiary. In such event, Time Warner Cable shall promptly pay to Holdco all such payments made by Holdco through its billing system. Without limiting the foregoing, Comcast Subsidiary shall cause Holdco to provide to Time Warner Cable all information in its possession that is reasonably required by Time Warner Cable in connection with such reimbursement. Section 7.11 UPDATED SCHEDULES. (a) On one or more occasions, Time Warner Cable may, at least five Business Days prior to Closing: supplement Schedule 6.5(a) to reflect leases, franchises, licenses, authorizations, consents, permits, Contracts or commitments which were entered into or obtained between the date hereof and the Closing Date not in violation of the terms of this Agreement and are required to be disclosed in Schedule 6.5(a) in order for the representation and warranty contained in Section 6.5(a) to be true, complete and correct or supplement any other Schedule to this Agreement (other than the Schedules to any of Section 6.1, 6.2, 6.15 or 6.18) or to the Tax Matters Agreement,
66 with additional information to the extent that it reflects events, acts or omissions that first occurred between the date hereof and the Closing Date and that are not prohibited by this Agreement to be taken, and that would have been required to be included in one or more Schedules to this Agreement or the Tax Matters Agreement in order for the representations and warranties of Time Warner Cable contained in this Agreement or in the Tax Matters Agreement to be true, complete and correct as of the Closing. Any such supplement to a Schedule pursuant to clause (i) above shall specifically identify each license, Contract or other item being added to Schedule 6.5(a) and any supplement pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be made with reasonable specificity and shall identify, to Time Warner Cable's knowledge, the potential Liability associated with the relevant action, condition or event. Without limitation to Section 7.20, for purposes of determining whether there is any liability on the part of Time Warner Cable following Closing for breaches of its representations and warranties under this Agreement, the Schedules to this Agreement shall be deemed to include only (a) the information contained therein on the date hereof, (b) information added to the Schedules for Section 6.3(c), 6.3(f) or 6.5 pursuant to Section 7.20 and (c) information added to such Schedules by written supplements to this Agreement delivered in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 7.11; PROVIDED, that for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a), any update to the Schedules pursuant to clause (c) shall be disregarded. (b) In addition, if after the date that is the fifth Business Day prior to Closing and the Closing, Time Warner Cable first becomes aware of any event, act, occurrence or omission which, if known on the fifth day prior to Closing would have been permitted to be included in a supplement pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing paragraph, then Time Warner Cable may make such supplement as provided above (in which case such supplement shall be deemed to have been made pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing paragraph); PROVIDED that Time Warner Cable may only utilize the rights in this paragraph on one occasion and, if Comcast Subsidiary elects, upon receipt of any such supplement pursuant to this paragraph, the date of Closing may be delayed until the end of the next succeeding month. Section 7.12 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. Each of the parties hereto agree to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings (including completed transfer tax returns, showing in each case a purchase price or consideration reasonably acceptable to Comcast Subsidiary and Time Warner Cable) and to take such other commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to evidence, consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to vest in Holdco the same title to the Transferred Assets that Time Warner Cable (together with its Affiliates) had with respect thereto immediately prior to the Holdco Transaction.
67 Section 7.13 POST-CLOSING ACCESS TO PERSONNEL RECORDS After the Closing Date, Time Warner Cable shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Comcast Subsidiary and Holdco with access to, and the right to make copies or extracts of, pertinent information from the personnel files and records of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates relating to Transferred System Employees in connection with litigation, administrative proceedings, payment of Applicable Taxes or any other valid business reason from time to time during normal business hours upon reasonable notice from Comcast Subsidiary or Holdco (i) with respect to matters other than matters relating to Applicable Taxes, for a period not to exceed one year from the Closing Date or (ii) with respect to matters relating to Applicable Taxes, until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to such Taxes, in each case except to the extent that Time Warner Cable is required by law to keep such files and records confidential. Section 7.14 DISTANT BROADCAST SIGNALS. Unless otherwise restricted or prohibited by any Governmental Authority, applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, Time Warner Cable shall, if requested by Comcast Subsidiary, delete prior to Closing any distant broadcast signals with respect to the Transferred Systems which Comcast Subsidiary determines shall result in unacceptable liability on the part of Comcast Subsidiary or Holdco for copyright payments with respect to continued carriage of such signals after Closing. Section 7.15 TAX RETURNS WITH RESPECT TO APPLICABLE TAXES. (a) Time Warner Cable shall have exclusive and sole responsibility for the preparation and filing of all Applicable Tax Returns that are required to be filed with any Governmental Authority on or prior to the Closing Date. (b) Holdco shall prepare and file all Applicable Tax Returns that are required to be filed with any Governmental Authority after the Closing Date. Holdco shall deliver any such Straddle Period Applicable Tax Returns to Time Warner Cable for its review at least 30 days prior to the date on which such Straddle Period Applicable Tax Return is required to be filed. Except as provided herein, all Straddle Period Applicable Tax Returns shall (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest) be prepared on a basis consistent with the elections, accounting methods, conventions, assumptions and principles of taxation on the most recently filed Applicable Tax Returns of Holdco or a previous owner of the Transferred Systems to the extent relevant to such Transferred Systems. Subject to the foregoing, Time Warner Cable and Holdco shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation and filing of any Straddle Period Applicable Tax Returns. Section 7.16 ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. Following the Good Faith Notice Date, Comcast Subsidiary may upon reasonable advance written notice and during normal business hours, at Comcast Subsidiary's expense, perform any environmental site assessments of the Owned Property or Leased Property (subject to the final sentence of this Section 7.16) as Comcast Subsidiary determines, in its sole discretion, to have performed; PROVIDED that prior to taking any samples of soil or groundwater for testing, Comcast Subsidiary shall have a reasonable basis for determining that such sampling is
68 appropriate. Time Warner Cable shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of Comcast Subsidiary and its consultants with respect to the conduct of such assessments or sampling. Any assessment performed pursuant to this Section 7.16 shall to the fullest extent practicable be designed so as not to disrupt the business and operations of the Transferred Systems. Any right to perform an assessment pursuant to this Section 7.16 at a Leased Property shall be subject to Time Warner Cable not being prohibited from performing such assessment pursuant to the lease for such Leased Property. Section 7.17 CERTAIN NOTICES. Prior to the Closing, Time Warner Cable, with respect to the Transferred Systems, shall cause to be timely filed a request for renewal under Section 626 of the Cable Act with the proper Governmental Authority with respect to Transferred System Franchises that shall expire within 36 months after any date between the date of this Agreement and Closing Date. Section 7.18 FRANCHISE EXPIRATIONS. From the Good Faith Notice Date until Closing, Time Warner Cable shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain renewals or valid extensions of any Transferred Systems Franchises which expire on or before December 31, 2007, in the ordinary course of business. Neither Time Warner Cable nor any of its Affiliates shall agree or accede to any material (or after the Good Faith Notice Date, any) modifications or amendments to or in connection with, or the imposition of any material (or after the Good Faith Notice Date, any) condition to the renewal or extension of, any of the Transferred System Franchises that are not reasonably acceptable to Comcast Subsidiary. Time Warner Cable agrees, from the Good Faith Notice Date until Closing, upon reasonable prior notice, to allow representatives of Comcast Subsidiary to attend meetings and hearings before applicable Governmental Authorities in connection with the renewal or extension of any Transferred Systems License or Transferred Systems Franchise. Section 7.19 INSURANCE. Time Warner Cable will use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to cause insurance policies of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates that immediately prior to Closing provide coverage to or with respect to the Transferred Business, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Systems to continue to provide such coverage with respect to acts, omissions, and events occurring prior to the Closing in accordance with their terms as if the Closing had not occurred; PROVIDED THAT to the extent Time Warner Cable takes any action with respect to its umbrella insurance policies that similarly effects all of the Time Warner Cable Retained Systems but results in such insurance coverage no longer being available (other than a change denying coverage based upon a Person ceasing to be an Affiliate of Time Warner Cable), Time Warner Cable shall not be deemed to have breached this Section 7.19 and shall have no liability with respect thereto. Time Warner Cable will give Comcast Subsidiary written notice of the taking of any such action if done during the first 12 months after the Closing prior to or as soon as practicable thereafter. Time Warner Cable shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with and assist Holdco, if Holdco determines to make any claim under any such policy with respect to any pre-Closing act, omission or event. Holdco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify Time Warner Cable when it becomes aware of any
69 such claim; PROVIDED, that the failure of Holdco to provide such notice shall not relieve Time Warner Cable of its obligations under this Section 7.19, except to the extent that Time Warner Cable's rights under the applicable insurance policy are prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Section 7.20 SECOND STAGE REVIEW. (a) The Comcast Parties acknowledge that as of the date hereof Time Warner Cable has only been required to make good faith efforts to make the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.3(c), 6.3(f) and 6.5 true, correct and complete based on the limited information in the possession of Time Warner Cable as of the date hereof without consulting with the Transferred Systems Employees or obtaining any information in the possession of the Transferred Systems. The purpose of this Section 7.20 is that during the 25 day period after receipt of the Good Faith Notice or as otherwise contemplated by Section 7.20(e) Time Warner Cable shall have the ability to update the Schedules for Sections 6.3(c), 6.3(f) and 6.5 by delivering the Second Stage Bringdown Certificate and Second Stage Documents, in each case after consultation with the employees of the Transferred Systems Employees, whereupon Comcast Subsidiary will have until the later of December 1, 2004 and 30 days after the receipt of such materials (the later of (i) and (ii), the "OPTION DECISION DATE") to determine whether or not to exercise the Option (in its sole discretion). This Section 7.20 shall be deemed to qualify each of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.3(c), 6.3(f) and 6.5 in their entirety, but only to the extent such representations and warranties are made as of the date hereof. Any update of Schedules made pursuant to this Section 7.20 shall be made with reasonable specificity, in good faith. No item may be added to a Schedule pursuant to this Section 7.20 if the relevant item was, to Time Warner Cable's knowledge, located in the one of the Designated Offices as of the date hereof. (b) At any time after October 5, 2004, Comcast Subsidiary may deliver to Time Warner Cable a written notice (the "GOOD FAITH NOTICE" and the date such notice is so delivered, the "GOOD FAITH NOTICE DATE") stating that Comcast Subsidiary intends in good faith to exercise the Option on or prior to the Option Decision Date unless as a result of its diligence review after such delivery by Time Warner Cable it determines that it is not in its best interest to exercise the Option. For the avoidance of doubt, no more than one Good Faith Notice may be delivered. (c) Time Warner Cable shall, within 25 days of receipt of the Good Faith Notice: deliver to Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary the Second Stage Bringdown Certificate and, concurrent therewith, and (ii) provide or otherwise make available to Comcast Trust, Comcast Subsidiary and/or their respective counsel the Second Stage Documents in accordance with this Section 7.20. All information included in the Schedules delivered with the Second Stage Bringdown Certificate shall be deemed to modify the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.3(c), 6.3(f) and 6.5, as applicable, as of the hereof and as of the Closing Date. (d) Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary may, on the Good Faith Notice Date, request additional documents relating to the Transferred Business, the
70 Transferred Assets or the Transferred Systems. Any such documents that would reasonably be expected to be material to Comcast Subsidiary's decision as to whether to exercise the Option, and that can be delivered or otherwise made available to Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary by Time Warner Cable's good faith exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts within 25 days of receipt of the Good Faith Notice, shall be so delivered or made available as Second Stage Documents concurrent with the delivery of the Second Stage Bringdown Certificate. (e) If Comcast Subsidiary fails to deliver the Good Faith Notice prior to exercising the Option, Time Warner Cable may nevertheless deliver the Second Stage Bringdown Certificate and Second Stage Documents to Comcast Trust and Comcast Subsidiary within 25 days following the Option Exercise Date. If Comcast Subsidiary fails to deliver the Good Faith Notice prior to exercising the Option, for all purposes hereunder, references to the Good Faith Notice Date shall be deemed to be references to the Option Exercise Date. (f) To the extent any representation and warranty in Sections 6.3(c), 6.3(f) and 6.5 purports to relate to any Second Stage Document, such representation and warranty shall, subject to Section 7.20(g), only be made in the Second Stage Bringdown Certificate and at Closing. (g) The representations and warranties of Time Warner Cable in the Second Stage Bringdown Certificate will be treated as if they had been representations and warranties of Time Warner Cable in this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement, including the conditions and indemnities in Articles 8 and 11, respectively. (h) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the delivery of the Good Faith Notice, Comcast Subsidiary shall not be required or obligated to exercise the Option, and shall not otherwise be deemed to have exercised the Option, based upon delivery of the Good Faith Notice. The Option will only be exercised as set forth in Section 2.1(a)(i). Section 7.21 PRE-CLOSING ACCESS. Prior to delivery of the Good Faith Notice, Comcast shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of Time Warner Cable, (i) initiate or maintain contact with any Transferred Systems Employee regarding the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise related thereto, access any of the properties, whether owned or leased, of the Transferred Systems and subject to applicable Legal Requirements disclose the identity of the Transferred Systems to any Person other than any of the officers, employees, directors and advisors of Comcast or its Affiliates, provided that such officers, employees, directors and advisors are first advised of the confidential nature of such information. Comcast shall be responsible for any breach of such confidentiality obligation on the part of any of its Affiliates or such officers, employees, directors and advisors. No breach of this Section 7.21 shall result in a failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.2(b).
71 Section 7.22 PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS. Between the Good Faith Notice Date and the Closing, Time Warner Cable shall not initiate any new Subscriber campaigns or promotions on a local or regional level with respect to the Transferred Systems absent the consent of Comcast Subsidiary, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7.22 shall not prohibit Time Warner Cable from initiating any new Subscriber campaigns or promotions on a divisional or national level. Section 7.23 LAUNCH SUPPORT. At the Closing, Time Warner Cable shall deliver to Comcast Subsidiary a schedule of the services subject to Specified Launch Support Liabilities and, with respect to each such service, the remaining time period (which shall in no event be later than the fifth anniversary of the date hereof) in which an action in respect of any Transferred System could result in an obligation to make a payment in respect of a Specified Launch Support Liability.

Section 11.3 PROCEDURE FOR CERTAIN INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS. Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "INDEMNITEE") of written notice of the assertion or the commencement of any Litigation with respect to any matter referred to in Sections 11.1 or 11.2 or the assertion by any Governmental Authority of a claim of noncompliance under any Franchise relating, in whole or in part, to any pre-Closing period (a "FRANCHISE MATTER"), the Indemnitee shall give written notice thereof to the party from whom indemnification is sought pursuant hereto (the "INDEMNITOR") and thereafter shall keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect
81 thereto; PROVIDED, that failure of the Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor notice and keep it reasonably informed as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such Litigation or Franchise Matter with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, at the Indemnitor's sole expense; PROVIDED that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter if (i) the Litigation or Franchise Matter relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Litigation or Franchise Matter seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee; or (iii) the Indemnitor has failed to defend or is failing to defend in good faith the Litigation or Franchise Matter. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter, (i) it shall not settle the Litigation or Franchise Matter unless the settlement shall include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff of a release of the Indemnitee, satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from all liability with respect to such Litigation or Franchise Matter and (ii) it shall indemnify and hold the Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all Losses caused by or arising out of any settlement or judgment of such claim and may not claim that it does not have an indemnification obligation with respect thereto. If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter, the Indemnitee may defend against or settle such claim in such manner and on such terms as it in good faith deems appropriate and shall be entitled to indemnification in respect thereof in accordance with Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable. If the Indemnitor is not entitled to assumes the defense or continue to control the defense of any Litigation or Franchise Matter as a result of the proviso in the second sentence of this Section 11.3, the Indemnitee shall not settle the Litigation or Franchise Matter in question if the Indemnitor shall have any obligation as a result of such settlement (whether monetary or otherwise) unless such settlement is consented to in writing by the Indemnitor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In no event shall the Indemnitee settle any Litigation or Franchise Matter for which the defense thereof is controlled by the Indemnitor absent the consent of the Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Litigation or Franchise Matter and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Section 11.4 DETERMINATION OF INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNTS AND RELATED MATTERS. (a) Time Warner Cable shall have no liability under Section 11.1(a) unless the aggregate amount of Losses otherwise subject to its indemnification obligations thereunder exceeds $5 million (the "THRESHOLD DAMAGE REQUIREMENT"), in which case Time Warner Cable shall be liable for the full amount of such Losses including the Losses incurred in reaching the Threshold Damage Requirement; PROVIDED, that for purposes of this subsection, the Threshold Damage Requirement shall NOT apply to any Losses resulting from or arising out of (i) the failure by Time Warner Cable to pay
82 any copyright payments, including interest and penalties thereon, when due or any other breach of Time Warner Cable's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements with respect to copyright payments contained in this Agreement, and (ii) breaches of the representations and warranties in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4(a), 6.13, 6.15 and 6.18. The maximum liability of Time Warner Cable under Section 11.1(a) shall not exceed $100 million (the "CAP"); PROVIDED, that the Cap shall not apply to breaches of the representations and warranties in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4(a)(i), 6.13, 6.15 and 6.18. (b) Holdco shall have no liability under Section 11.2(a) unless the aggregate amount of Losses otherwise subject to its indemnification obligations thereunder exceeds the Threshold Damage Requirement, in which case Holdco shall be liable for the full amount of such Losses including the Losses incurred in reaching the Threshold Damage Requirement; PROVIDED, that for purposes of this subsection, the Threshold Damage Requirement shall not apply to any Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, or 5.5. The maximum liability of Holdco in the aggregate under Section 11.2(a) shall not exceed the Cap; PROVIDED, that the Cap shall not apply to breaches of the representations and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, or 5.5. (c) Amounts payable by the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee in respect of any Losses under Sections 11.1 or 11.2 shall be payable by the Indemnitor as incurred by the Indemnitee, and shall bear interest at the Base Interest Rate plus 2% from the date the Losses for which indemnification is sought were incurred by the Indemnitee until the date of payment of indemnification by the Indemnitor. (d) If the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Loss for which indemnification is sought under Section 11.1(a) also resulted in a Loss to the Time Warner Cable Retained Cable Systems, the Loss for which indemnification is sought under Section 11.1(a) shall only be available (subject to the further limitations in Section 11.4(a)) to the extent such Loss is greater than the proportionate Loss suffered by the Time Warner Cable Retained Cable Systems and the Transferred Systems, where proportionality is based on the percentage that the Redemption Securities represent to the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of Time Warner Cable, in each case immediately prior to giving effect to the Closing; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent the Loss for which indemnification is sought under Section 11.1(a) results from or arises out of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4(a), 6.5(a), 6.6 (the penultimate sentence only), 6.10 (the first sentence only), 6.12(c), 6.13, 6.15 and 6.18. By way of example only, if the Redemption Securities represent 20% of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of Time Warner Cable (immediately prior to giving effect to the Closing) and the Losses suffered by the Transferred Systems arising out of certain facts was $X and the Losses suffered by the Time Warner Cable Retained Cable Systems arising out of those same facts was $Y, then indemnification would be available under Section 11.1(a) but only in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) $X over (ii) the sum of $X and $Y multiplied by 0.2 (and subject to the further limitations contained in Section 11.4(a)).
83 (e) The Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to any Losses to the extent of any proceeds received in connection with any such Losses by the Indemnitee under any insurance policy of the Indemnitee in effect on the Closing Date (including under any rights under any insurance policies or proceeds that are part of the Transferred Assets). The Indemnitee will use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover under such insurance policies. (f) In determining the amount of any Losses in connection with any inaccuracy of a representation and warranty (but not for purposes of determining whether any such inaccuracy has occurred), any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifier in such representation or warranty will be disregarded. (g) Comcast Subsidiary shall have the right to enforce (on behalf and for the benefit of Holdco and any other Indemnitee pursuant to Section 11.1) the right to indemnification under Section 11.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, to the extent that any Indemnitee pursuant to Section 11.1 is or becomes a shareholder of Time Warner Cable or Time Warner or a limited partner of TWE, indemnification hereunder shall not include Losses suffered by such Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) in its shareholder or limited partner capacity by reason of (i) the indemnities being provided by Time Warner Cable hereunder or (ii) Losses suffered in such capacity in respect of any Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or Holdco Indemnified Liabilities. Section 11.5 TIME AND MANNER OF CERTAIN CLAIMS. The representations and warranties of Comcast Trust, Comcast Subsidiary, Time Warner Cable or any Transferring Person in this Agreement and any Transaction Document to which such Person is a party shall survive Closing for a period of 1 year; PROVIDED, that the representations in Section 6.24 shall not survive Closing.

Comcast, Comcast Subsidiary and Comcast Trust agree, on behalf of their self and each of the other Comcast Trust Releasing Parties, that they will not assert any claims against any Time Warner Cable Released Party with respect to matters covered by the foregoing release. (b) Nothing contained in Section 11.8(a) shall impair any right of any Person to enforce this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, in each case in accordance with its terms. Section 11.9 INDEMNIFICATION FOR INCOME TAXES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of Sections 11.1 through 11.8 shall not apply to any Liability for Income Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by the Tax Matters Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, rights under this Agreement shall
85 provide the exclusive remedies for any breach of the representations and warranties provided in Section 6.24 hereof. Section 11.10 TAX TREATMENT OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS. (a) For all Tax purposes (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest) the parties hereto agree to treat and to cause their respective affiliates to treat any payment (i) to Holdco by Time Warner Cable pursuant to an indemnification, reimbursement or refund obligation provided for in this Agreement (a "TIME WARNER CABLE INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT"), or (ii) to Time Warner Cable by Holdco pursuant to an indemnification, reimbursement or refund obligation provided for in this Agreement (a "HOLDCO INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT" and collectively with any Time Warner Cable Indemnification Payment, an "INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT") as (x) with respect to a Time Warner Cable Indemnification Payment, a contribution by Time Warner Cable to Holdco occurring immediately prior to the Closing, and (y) with respect to a Holdco Indemnification Payment, an adjustment to the cash transferred by Time Warner Cable to Holdco pursuant to the Holdco Transaction occurring immediately prior to the Closing. (b) Notwithstanding Section 11.10(a) above, any Indemnification Payments that represent interest payable under Section 11.4(c) hereof shall be treated for all Tax purposes (unless required by a change in applicable Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest), as (i) deductible to the Indemnitor and (ii) taxable to the Indemnitee. (c) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall be (i) increased to take account of net Tax cost, if any, incurred by the Indemnitee arising from the receipt or accrual of an Indemnification Payment hereunder, (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of the net Tax benefit, if any, realized by the Indemnitee arising from incurring or paying such indemnified amount. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or benefit, (i) the term Indemnitee shall be deemed to include any member of any Affiliated Group of which the Indemnitee is a member, and (ii) the Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt or accrual of any Indemnification Payment hereunder or incurring or paying any indemnified amount hereunder. Any Indemnification Payment hereunder shall initially be made without regard to this Section 11.10(c) and shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such net Tax cost (including gross-up) or net Tax benefit only after the Indemnitee has Actually Realized such cost or benefit. The amount of any increase or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustment with respect to the Indemnitee's liability for Taxes, and payments between the parties hereto to reflect such adjustment shall be made. Notwithstanding the above, this Section 11.10(c) shall not apply to interest as described in 11.10(b).
86 Section 11.11 GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS OF COMCAST.

(b) Comcast hereby acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee constitutes an absolute, present, primary, continuing and unconditional guaranty of performance, compliance and payment by each of the Guaranteed Parties of the Guaranteed Obligations when due under this Agreement and any Transaction Document to which any Guaranteed Party is a party delivered in connection herewith and not of collection only and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to enforce such performance, compliance or payment by a Guaranteed Party or upon any other condition or contingency. Comcast hereby waives any right to require a proceeding first against any of the Guaranteed Parties.

The parties agree that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. The parties waive any requirement for security or the posting of any bond or other surety in connection with any temporary or permanent award or injunctive, mandatory or other equitable relief. Section 12.7 JURISDICTION. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions

Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.

Section 12.16 RISK OF LOSS; GOVERNMENTAL TAKING. (a) Time Warner Cable shall bear the risk of any loss or damage to the Transferred Assets resulting from fire, theft or other casualty (except reasonable wear and tear) at all times prior to the Closing. In the event any such loss or damage occurs, Time Warner Cable shall (at its expense) use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such lost or damaged property as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing (or, if such damaged property is not replaced or restored prior to Closing, Time Warner shall indemnify Holdco for any Losses arising out of such unrepaired damage or unrestored property) unless promptly (but in no event later than 10 Business Days) after actually becoming aware of such loss or damage Time Warner Cable notifies Comcast Subsidiary in writing that it will not undertake such obligation; PROVIDED that if Time Warner Cable so notifies Comcast Subsidiary, Comcast Subsidiary may at any time within 10 days of receipt of such notice elect by written notice to Time Warner Cable to terminate this Agreement; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if any SHS Transferred Assets have suffered loss or damage resulting from fire, theft or other casualty and as a result the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(r) and Section 8.2(i) are not satisfied, Time Warner Cable shall (at its expense) use commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such SHS Transferred Assets as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing such that such loss or damage does not result in the conditions set forth in
92 Section 8.1(r) and Section 8.2(i) not being satisfied. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the previous sentence, Time Warner Cable shall be discharged of any and all obligations hereunder, subject to Section 10.2. Without limitation to the first sentence of this Section 12.16(a), and except with respect to the Specified Holdco System, if any loss or damage is equal to or greater than $30,000,000 and is sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal operations of any material portion of a Transferred System by the Outside Closing Date, Time Warner Cable shall, to the extent reasonably practical, immediately notify Comcast Subsidiary in writing of that fact (which notice shall, to the extent reasonably practical, specify with reasonable particularity the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known or reasonably ascertainable, and the insurance coverage related thereto), and Comcast Subsidiary, at any time within 10 days after receipt of such notice, may elect by written notice to Time Warner Cable, to either (i) waive such defect and proceed toward consummation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (PROVIDED THAT any such waiver shall also be deemed to be a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder for any breach of any (x) representation or warranty of Time Warner Cable set forth in Article 6 resulting from any such loss or damage or (y) covenant hereunder to the extent that compliance therewith is frustrated or made commercially impracticable as a result of such loss or damage) or (ii) terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 10.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects so to terminate this Agreement, Time Warner Cable shall be discharged of any and all obligations hereunder, subject to Section 10.2. If Comcast Subsidiary elects to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such loss or damage referred to in the second preceding sentence and does so, there shall be no adjustment in the consideration payable to or by Transferee on account of such loss or damage, but all insurance proceeds paid or payable as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting in such loss or damage (to the extent not already expended by Time Warner Cable to restore or replace the lost or damaged Transferred Assets) except for any proceeds from business interruption insurance relating to the loss of revenue for the period through and including the Closing Date, shall be delivered by Time Warner Cable, on an effective after-tax basis, to Holdco, or the rights to such proceeds shall be assigned by Time Warner Cable to Holdco if not yet paid to Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable shall pay any deductible required and/or the self-insured portion of any such loss with respect to all such insurance proceeds. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Closing Net Liabilities Amount. (b) If, prior to Closing, any material part of or interest in the Transferred Assets is taken or condemned as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or if a Governmental Authority having such power informs Time Warner Cable that it intends to condemn or take all or any of the Transferred Assets (such event being called, in either case, a "TAKING"), then Comcast Subsidiary may terminate this Agreement. If Comcast Subsidiary does not elect to terminate this Agreement, then (i) Comcast Subsidiary shall have the sole right, in the name of Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates, if Comcast Subsidiary so elects, to negotiate for, claim contest and have Holdco receive all damages with respect to the Taking, (ii) Time Warner Cable shall be relieved of its obligation to convey to Holdco the Transferred Assets or interests that are the subject of the Taking, (iii) at Closing, Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates shall
93 assign to Holdco all of Time Warner Cable's and its Affiliates' rights to all payments payable with respect to such Taking and shall pay to Holdco, on an effective after-tax basis, all payments previously paid to Time Warner Cable or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Taking, and (iv) following Closing, Time Warner Cable and its Affiliates shall give Holdco such further assurances of such rights and assignment with respect to the Taking as Holdco may from time to time reasonably request. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Closing Net Liabilities Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the Closing, any discrete item or items of SHS Transferred Assets that is or are capable of being replaced or restored using commercially reasonably efforts shall be subject to a Taking and as a result the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(r) and Section 8.2(i) are not satisfied, then Time Warner Cable shall (at its expense) use commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such SHS Transferred Asset(s) as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing such that such Taking does not result in the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(r) and Section 8.2(i) not being satisfied. (c) If, prior to Closing, any assets relating primarily to any Specified Time Warner Cable System have suffered loss or damage resulting from fire, theft or other casualty and as a result the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(s) and Section 8.2(j) are not satisfied, Time Warner Cable shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such Transferred Assets as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing such that such loss or damage does not result in the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(s) and Section 8.2(j) not being satisfied.

EXHIBIT 99.2 ------------ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: TIME WARNER AND COMCAST SET PLAN TO REDUCE COMCAST'S INTEREST IN TIME WARNER CABLE NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA, SEPTEMBER 27, 2004 -- Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) today announced an agreement that provides Comcast with an option to reduce its effective overall interest in Time Warner Cable Inc. from approximately 21% to 17% in exchange for stock of a subsidiary that will hold cable systems and cash. Time Warner Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Parsons said: "Today's announcement is another example of our working closely with Comcast to reach a mutually beneficial outcome to the business matters facing our companies. For our part, if Comcast chooses to exercise its option, we'll have the opportunity to increase ownership of our cable company based on a mutually attractive valuation. In addition, the trust that holds Comcast's interest in Time Warner Cable has agreed not to ask us to begin the process to register its Time Warner Cable ownership for at least the next six months, providing the two of us time to explore alternative approaches to facilitating Comcast's exit from its ownership position in Time Warner Cable. I look forward to continuing this productive relationship with Comcast." Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts said: "We are very pleased to be announcing this agreement with Time Warner today. As we have stated from the beginning it has always been our plan to dispose of our stake in Time Warner Cable expeditiously. This agreement marks an important step towards completing that goal efficiently while also maximizing value for our shareholders." The agreement grants Comcast the option, which can be exercised between December 1, 2004 and April 1, 2005, to require Time Warner Cable to redeem a portion of the Time Warner Cable common stock held by the Comcast trust in exchange for 100% of the common stock of a Time Warner Cable subsidiary. At the time of exchange, the subsidiary will own cable systems serving about 90,000 basic subscribers and approximately $750 million in cash. In addition, the Comcast trust agreed not to request prior to April 1, 2005 that Time Warner Cable register the shares in Time Warner Cable held by the trust for sale in a public offering.
Comcast trusts currently own an effective interest of approximately 21% in Time Warner Cable - held through a 17.9% common stock interest in Time Warner Cable and a 4.7% limited partnership interest in Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P., a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable. If Comcast exercises the option, it will reduce the trust's effective interest in Time Warner Cable's business to approximately 17% - consisting of a 13.7% common stock interest in Time Warner Cable Inc. and a 4.7% limited partnership interest in Time Warner Entertainment. In conjunction with the restructuring of Time Warner Entertainment completed in 2003, the Comcast trust received customary registration rights relating to its shares of common stock of Time Warner Cable. In December 2003, the Comcast trust requested that Time Warner Cable register the trust's shares in Time Warner Cable for sale in a public offering. The agreement announced today supersedes the trust's previous request for registration.
