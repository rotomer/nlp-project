Item 8.01 Other Events. America Online Note Redemption - ------------------------------ As previously reported by Time Warner Inc. (the "Company") at page 32 in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 (the "September 2004 Form 10-Q"), the Company and America Online, Inc. ("AOL"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, called for redemption, to occur on December 6, 2004, of all of the Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2019 issued by AOL (the "Zero-Coupon Notes"). On December 6, 2004, the Company repaid in full all accrued and outstanding amounts under the Zero-Coupon Notes (not including a nominal amount of Zero-Coupon Notes that were converted) and retired the Zero-Coupon Notes. The aggregate amount of such payments was approximately $1.22 billion, which amount was paid with cash on hand. America Online Restructuring - ---------------------------- As previously reported at page 22 in the September 2004 Form 10-Q, during the third quarter of 2004, AOL began considering plans to realign its resources more efficiently in response to the changing dynamics of its businesses. Subsequently, in November 2004, AOL reorganized its management and operations to more effectively focus AOL's businesses on the markets served. On December 7 and November 23, 2004, AOL committed to plans to reduce its workforce to align the workforce with AOL's new management structure. These plans are expected to result in pre-tax charges in the fourth quarter of 2004 totaling approximately $60 million for severance benefits (of which approximately $5 million relates to the November 23, 2004 plan). The employee terminations pursuant to these plans will be principally completed, and the corresponding severance benefits paid, in the first quarter of 2005.
