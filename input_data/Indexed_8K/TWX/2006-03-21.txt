Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. On March 15, 2006, Time Warner Inc. (the "Company") issued 5,400,000 shares of the Company's Series LMCN-V Common Stock ("LMCN-V Stock") to two wholly owned subsidiaries of Liberty Media Corporation (collectively, "Liberty") upon conversion of 5,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), that were returned to Liberty by the financial institution that had borrowed such shares in connection with a stock loan arrangement entered into by Liberty. Pursuant to the stock loan agreement, the financial institution was permitted, at any time, to return to Liberty shares of the Company's Common Stock, at which time the shares of Common Stock must be converted into LMCN-V Stock. This conversion partially reverses the conversion of 9,400,000 shares of LMCN-V Stock into Common Stock that took place on February 1, 2005 to facilitate Liberty's stock loan arrangement. If these shares of LMCN-V Stock are once again transferred to a party that is unaffiliated with Liberty Media Corporation or any of its affiliates, such shares would once again be converted into the Company's Common Stock. As a result of this conversion, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock decreased by 5,400,000 and the number of issued and outstanding shares of LMCN-V Stock increased by the same amount. The calculations of the Company's basic and diluted earnings per share are not affected by this conversion because the issued and outstanding shares of LMCN-V Stock are included in such per share calculations. In connection with the issuance of LMCN-V Stock upon conversion of the Common Stock, the Company relied on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 2
