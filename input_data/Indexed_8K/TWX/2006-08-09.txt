Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. On August 4, 2006, Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner" or the "Company") issued 49,115,656 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), upon conversion by five wholly owned subsidiaries of Liberty Media Corporation (collectively, "Liberty") of an aggregate of 49,115,656 shares of the Company's Series LMCN-V Common Stock ("LMCN-V Stock") held by Liberty. As a result of this conversion, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock increased by 49,115,656 and the number of issued and outstanding shares of LMCN-V Stock decreased by the same amount. Immediately following this conversion, Liberty held 43,529,380 shares of LMCN-V Stock. The calculations of the Company's basic and diluted earnings per share are not affected by this conversion because the issued and outstanding shares of LMCN-V Stock have historically been included in such per share calculations. In connection with the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of the LMCN-V Stock, the Company relied on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As previously reported in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the Company is subject to the terms of a consent decree (the "Turner Consent Decree") entered into in connection with the approval by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") of the acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. by Historic TW Inc. ("Historic TW") in 1996. The Turner Consent Decree required, among other things, that any Time Warner stock held by Liberty be non-voting stock, except that it would be entitled to a vote of 1/100 of a vote per share when voting with the outstanding common stock on the election of directors and a vote equal to the vote of the common stock with respect to corporate matters that would adversely change the rights or terms of the stock. On February 16, 2006, Liberty filed a petition with the FTC seeking to terminate the Turner Consent Decree as it applies to Liberty, including all voting restrictions on its Time Warner stock holdings. On June 14, 2006, the FTC issued an order granting Liberty's petition. As a result, Liberty now has the ability to request that the shares of LMCN-V Stock it holds be converted into shares of Common Stock.
