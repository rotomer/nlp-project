TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Comcast Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the Special-Purpose Combined Carve Out Financial Statements of the Los Angeles, Dallas and Cleveland Cable System Operations (A Carve Out of Comcast Corporation) (the "Exchange Systems") as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related combined statements of operations, invested equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These combined financial statements are the responsibility of Comcast Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Exchange Systems are not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Exchange Systems' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Exchange Systems as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 2, the Exchange Systems are an integrated business of Comcast and are not a stand-alone entity. The combined financial statements of the Exchange Systems reflect the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses directly attributable to the Exchange Systems, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management, to present the combined financial position, results of operations, changes in invested equity and cash flows of the Exchange Systems on a stand-alone basis and do not necessarily reflect the combined financial position, results of operations, changes in invested equity and cash flows of the Exchange Systems in the future or what they would have been had the Exchange Systems been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

1. BUSINESS
Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") is a Pennsylvania corporation, incorporated in December 2001. Comcast is principally involved in the development, management and operation of broadband communications networks in the United States. Comcast's cable operations served approximately 21.4 million video subscribers as of December 31, 2005.
In April 2005, Comcast entered into agreements with Time Warner, Inc. ("Time Warner") to (i) jointly acquire substantially all of the assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia"); (ii) redeem Comcast's interest in Time Warner Cable ("TWC") and its subsidiary, Time Warner Entertainment ("TWE"); and (iii) exchange certain cable systems with Time Warner Cable ("proposed transactions").
The proposed transactions have been subject to customary regulatory review and approvals, including court approval in the Adelphia Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, which has now been obtained. In July 2006, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") approved the proposed transactions which represented the last federal approval needed in order to close the proposed transactions. The proposed transactions closed on July 31, 2006.
The accompanying special purpose financial statements represent the combined financial position and results of operations for Los Angeles, Dallas and Cleveland cable systems being exchanged with Time Warner (the "Exchange Systems"). Within these financial statements "we," "us" and "our" refers to the Exchange Systems. The Exchange Systems served approximately 1.1 million video subscribers as of July 31, 2006.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying special purpose combined carve-out financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The Exchange Systems are an integrated business of Comcast that operate in a single business segment and are not a stand-alone entity. The combined financial statements of the Exchange Systems reflect the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses directly attributable to the Exchange Systems, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management, to present the combined financial position, results of operations, changes in invested equity and cash flows of the Exchange Systems on a stand-alone basis. The allocation methodologies have been described within the notes to the combined financial statements where appropriate, and management considers the allocations to be reasonable. The financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect the combined financial position, results of operations, changes in invested equity and cash flows of the Exchange Systems in the future or what they would have been had the Exchange Systems been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
Management's use of estimates
The combined financial statements of the Exchange Systems have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for various
 
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION)
YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
items, such as allowances for doubtful accounts, investments, depreciation and amortization, asset impairment, non-monetary transactions, certain acquisition-related liabilities, pensions and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, and legal contingencies.
Fair Values
Estimated fair value amounts presented in these combined financial statements have been determined using available market information and appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The estimates presented in these combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value estimates were based on pertinent information available to us as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The fair value estimates have not been comprehensively updated for purposes of these combined financial statements since those dates.
Cash and cash equivalents
All highly-liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, cash equivalents consist of deposits in local depository accounts. The carrying amounts of our cash equivalents approximate their fair values at December 31, 2005 and 2004.
Property, plant and equipment
The Exchange Systems record property, plant and equipment at cost. Depreciation is generally recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. The significant components of property and equipment are as follows (dollars in thousands):
Improvements that extend these lives of the related assets are capitalized and other repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts and, unless they are presented separately, the gain or loss on disposition is recognized as a component of depreciation expense.
 
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION)
YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
The costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities and new cable service installations are also capitalized. Costs include all direct labor and materials, as well as various indirect costs.
Investment
As of December 31, 2005, the Exchange Systems hold a 20% investment in Adlink Cable Advertising, LLC ("Adlink"), an entity that operates the adsales interconnect in the Los Angeles area that serves our Los Angeles cable system. The investment in Adlink is accounted for under the equity method as we and our affiliates have the ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies. The investment in Adlink was recorded at original cost and is adjusted to recognize our proportionate share of Adlink's net losses after the date of investment, amortization of basis differences, additional cash contributions made, dividends received and impairment charges resulting from adjustments to net realizable value. Summarized financial information for Adlink is provided in Note 4.
Asset Retirement Obligations
SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," requires that a liability be recognized for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Certain of our franchise agreements and leases contain provisions requiring us to restore facilities or remove equipment in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our franchise agreements and have concluded that the related franchise right is an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, the possibility is remote that we would be required to incur significant restoration or removal costs in the foreseeable future. We would record an estimated liability in the unlikely event a franchise agreement containing such a provision were no longer expected to be renewed. The obligations related to the removal provisions contained in our lease agreements or any disposal obligations related to our operating assets are not estimatable or are not material to our combined financial condition or results of operations.
Intangible Assets
Cable franchise rights represent the value attributed to agreements with local authorities that allow access to homes in cable service areas acquired in connection with business combinations. We do not amortize cable franchise rights because we have determined that they have an indefinite life. We reassess this determination periodically for each franchise based on the factors included in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". Costs we incur in negotiating and renewing cable franchise agreements are included in other intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise renewal period, generally 10 years.
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill was allocated to the Exchange Systems based on the relative fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets, as determined by a third-party valuation expert. We test our goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life for impairment at least annually.
Other intangible assets consist principally of franchise related customer relationships acquired in business combinations subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," on July 1, 2001, cable

LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION)
YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
franchise renewal costs, computer software, and other contractual operating rights. We record these costs as assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements or estimated useful life, which generally range from 2 to 10 years.
Valuation of Long-Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets
In accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," we periodically evaluate the recoverability and estimated lives of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Such evaluations include analyses based on the cash generated by the underlying assets, profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends, funding by Comcast, or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset.
We evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, during the second quarter of each year, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We perform the impairment assessment of our goodwill at the cable operations level as components below this level are not separate reporting units and have similar economic characteristics that allow them to be aggregated into one reporting unit.
We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis, multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, analyses of current market transactions and profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends, and other determinants of fair value.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize video, high-speed internet, and phone revenues as service is provided. We manage credit risk by screening applicants for potential risk through the use of credit bureau data. If a subscribers' account is delinquent, various measures are used to collect outstanding amounts, up to and including termination of the subscribers' cable service. We recognize advertising sales revenue at estimated realizable values when the advertising is aired. Installation revenues obtained from the connection of subscribers to our broadband cable systems are less than related direct selling costs. Therefore, such revenues are recognized as connections are completed. Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay up to 5% of our gross revenues earned from providing cable services within the local franchising area. We normally pass these fees through to our cable subscribers. We classify fees collected from cable subscribers as a component of revenues pursuant to EITF 01-14, "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket' Expenses Incurred."
Programming Costs
Comcast secures programming content on behalf of the Exchange Systems. This programming is acquired for distribution to our subscribers, generally pursuant to multi-year license agreements, typically based on the number of subscribers that received the programming. From time to time these contracts expire and
 
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION)
YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
programming continues to be provided based on interim arrangements while the parties negotiate new contractual terms, sometimes with effective dates that affect prior periods. While payments are typically made under the prior contract terms, the amount of our programming costs recorded during these interim arrangements is based on our estimates of the ultimate contractual terms expected to be negotiated.
We have received or may receive incentives from programming networks for carriage of their programming. We reflect the deferred portion of these fees within non-current liabilities and amortize the fees as a reduction of programming costs (which are included in operating expenses) over the term of the programming contract.
Programming costs and amortization of the associated launch incentives have been allocated to the Exchange Systems on the basis of actual subscribers, and channel carriage, for each period presented.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"), and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended ("SFAS No. 123"). Compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Comcast's stock at the date of the grant over the amount an optionee must pay to acquire the stock. We record compensation expense for restricted stock awards based on the quoted market price of Comcast's stock at the date of the grant and the vesting period.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation. Total stock-based compensation expense was determined under the fair value method for all awards using the accelerated recognition method as permitted under SFAS No. 123:
The weighted average fair value at date of grant of a Comcast Class A common stock option granted under the Comcast option plans during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $13.16, $11.40 and $9.47, respectively. The fair value of each option granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION)
YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
Postretirement and Post Employment Benefits
We charge to operations the estimated costs of retiree benefits and benefits for former or inactive employees, after employment but before retirement, during the years the employees provide services. Eligible employees participate in benefit plans provided by Comcast, which include two former AT&T Broadband ("Broadband") defined benefit pension plans and a health care stipend plan. Costs associated with these plans are allocated to us based on the costs associated with our participating employees as a percentage of the total costs for all plan participants. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, these allocated costs were approximately $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $2.2 million and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our combined statements of operations.
Income Taxes
Our results of operations have historically been included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of Comcast Corporation and the state income tax returns of California, Texas and Ohio. The income tax amounts reflected in the accompanying special purpose combined carve-out financial statements have been allocated based on taxable income directly attributable to the Exchange Systems, resulting in a stand-alone presentation. We believe the assumptions underlying the allocation of income taxes are reasonable. However, the amounts allocated for income taxes in the accompanying special purpose combined carve-out financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amount of income taxes that would have been recorded had the combined systems been operated as a separate, stand-alone entity.
Income taxes have been provided for using the liability method in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, ("Statement No. 109"). Statement No. 109 requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled, are reflected in the combined financial statements in the period of enactment (see Note 7).

3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
SFAS No. 123R
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107") regarding the SEC's interpretation of SFAS No. 123R and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date or later modification. In addition, SFAS No. 123R will cause unrecognized cost (based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure) related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining requisite service period.
We adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, using the Modified Prospective Approach ("MPA"), accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted. The MPA requires that compensation expense be recorded for restricted stock and all unvested stock options as of January 1, 2006. We expect to continue using the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments to employees. For pro-forma disclosure purposes, we recognized the majority of our share-based compensation costs using the accelerated recognition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Upon adoption we will continue to recognize the cost of previously granted share-based awards under the accelerated recognition method and we will recognize the cost for new share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in an increase in 2006 compensation expense for the Exchange Systems of approximately $4.2 million, including the estimated impact of 2006 share-based awards.
SFAS No.153
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assetsan amendment of APB Opinion No. 29" ("SFAS No.153"). The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions" ("APB No. 29"), is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in APB No. 29, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. SFAS No. 153 amends APB No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for such exchange transactions occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.
SFAS No. 154
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections  a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3" ("SFAS No. 154"). SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and FASB Statement No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements," and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific

LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION)
YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
transition provisions, those provisions should be followed. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
FSP 115-1
In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" ("FSP 115-1"), which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FSP 115-1 will not have a material impact on our combined financial condition or results of operations.
4. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT
As of December 31, 2005, we have a 20% investment in Adlink, an entity that operates the adsales interconnect in the Los Angeles area and that serves our Los Angeles cable system. As described in Note 2, the Adlink investment is accounted for under the equity method as a result of our proportionate ownership interest and our ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies. Summarized financial information for Adlink is as follows:
 
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION) YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
The carrying amount of our investment in Adlink exceeded our proportionate interests in the book value of the investees' net assets by $4.4 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This difference relates to contract-based intangible assets and is included in investments in the accompanying combined balance sheets and is being amortized to equity in net loss of affiliates over the term of the underlying contract which expires in 2008.
5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of our intangible assets subject to amortization are as follows (dollars in thousands):
Estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is as follows (dollars in thousands):
6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Certain employees are eligible to contribute a portion of their compensation through payroll deductions, in accordance with specified guidelines, to various retirement-investment plans sponsored by Comcast. Comcast matches a percentage of the eligible employees' contributions up to certain limits. Expenses recorded in operating and selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying combined

statements of operations, related to these plans, amounted to $5.3 million, $5.2 million and $4.4 million for the years' ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
7. INCOME TAXES
Taxable income and / or loss generated by the Exchange Systems has been included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of Comcast and certain of its state income tax returns. Comcast has allocated income taxes to the Exchange Systems in the accompanying combined financial statements as if the Exchange Systems were held in a separate corporation which filed separate income tax returns. Comcast believes the assumptions underlying its allocation of income taxes on a separate return basis are reasonable. However, the amounts allocated for income taxes in the accompanying combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual amount of income taxes that would have been recorded had the Exchange Systems been held within a separate stand-alone entity.
Income tax (expense) benefit consists of the following components (dollars in thousands):
The effective income tax (expense) benefit differs from the U.S. federal statutory amount of 35% because of the effect of the following items:
 
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION) YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
The net deferred tax liability consists of the following components:
Gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2005, include $150.4 million of federal and $16.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, determined on a separate return basis, which would expire in periods through 2025. A valuation allowance has been recorded on the state carryforwards because the realizability of such tax benefits on a separate return basis is not more likely than not. The federal net operating loss carryforwards have been fully utilized in the consolidated federal income tax returns of Comcast. In addition, any unused state net operating losses will remain with Comcast subsequent to the exchange.
8. COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
The following table summarizes our minimum annual commitments under our rental commitments for office space, equipment and other non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands):
Rental expenses charged to operations were $9.7 million, $11.1 million and $11.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are reflected in operating and selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying combined statements of operations.

Contingencies
At Home Cases
Under the terms of the Broadband acquisition, Comcast Corporation is contractually liable for 50% of any liabilities of AT&T relating to certain At Home litigation. AT&T will be liable for the other 50%. Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, two actions brought by At Home's bondholders' liquidating trust against AT&T (and not naming Comcast Corporation): (i) a lawsuit filed against AT&T and certain of its senior officers in Santa Clara, California state court alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties, misappropriation of trade secrets and other causes of action and (ii) an action filed against AT&T in the District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that AT&T infringed an At Home patent by using its broadband distribution and high-speed internet backbone networks and equipment.
In May 2005, At Home bondholders' liquidating trust and AT&T agreed to settle these two actions. Pursuant to the settlement, AT&T agreed to pay $340 million to the bondholders' liquidating trust. The settlement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, and these two actions were dismissed. As a result of the settlement by AT&T, Comcast Corporation recorded a $170 million charge to other income (expense), reflecting Comcast's portion of the settlement amount to AT&T in its 2005 financial results. Other expense for 2005 includes a $20.3 million charge associated with the allocation of the At Home settlement.
Other
We are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our combined financial condition, but could possibly be material to our combined results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our combined financial position.
9. STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The following table summarizes our cash payments for interest and income taxes, and supplemental disclosures of non-cash investing and financing activities:
 
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION) YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Exchange Systems are a party to certain demand promissory notes payable to affiliates of Comcast. Interest recorded on these notes totaled $5.4 million, $3.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for each of the three years in the period ending December 31, 2005. The principal amount of the notes, and the related interest accrued thereon have been reflected in Notes Payable to Affiliates in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
Overview
Comcast and its subsidiaries provide certain management and administrative services to each of its cable systems, including the Exchange Systems. The costs of such services are reflected in appropriate categories in the accompanying combined statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Additionally, Comcast performs cash management functions on behalf of the Exchange Systems. Substantially all of the Exchange Systems' cash balances are swept to Comcast on a daily basis, where they are managed and invested by Comcast. As a result, all of our charges and cost allocations covered by these centralized cash management functions were deemed to have been paid by us to Comcast, in cash, during the period in which the cost was recorded in the combined financial statements. In addition, all of our cash receipts were advanced to Comcast as they were received. The excess of cash receipts advanced over the charges and cash allocation is reflected as net cash distributions to Comcast in the combined statements of invested equity and cash flows.
We consider all of our transactions with Comcast to be financing transactions, which are presented as net cash distributions to Comcast in the accompanying combined statements of cash flows.
Net Contributions From (Distributions to) Comcast
The significant components of the net cash contributions from (distributions to) Comcast for the years' ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, were as follows:
 
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION) YEARS' ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
 
Contributions from (distributions to) Comcast are generally recorded based on actual costs incurred, without a markup. The basis of allocation to the Exchange Systems, for the items described above, is as follows:
 As indicated above, Comcast utilizes a centralized cash management system under which all cash receipts are swept to, and managed and invested by, Comcast on a daily basis. To the extent customer payments are received by Comcast's third-party lockbox processors, or to the extent other cash receipts are received by Comcast, related to the Exchange Systems, such amounts are applied to the corresponding customer accounts receivable or miscellaneous receivable balances and are reflected net in net cash contributions from (distributions to) Comcast in the accompanying combined statements of invested equity.
Customer payments and other cash receipts
 Comcast centrally administers and incurs the costs associated with certain functions on a centralized basis, including programming contract administration and programming payments, payroll and related tax and benefits processing, and management of the costs of the high-speed data and telephone networks, and allocates the associated costs to the Exchange Systems. The costs incurred have been allocated to the Exchange Systems based on the actual amounts processed on behalf of the systems.
Expense allocations
 All cash disbursements for trade and other accounts payable, and accrued expenses, are funded centrally by a subsidiary of Comcast. Transactions processed for trade and other accounts payable, and accrued expenses, associated with the operations of the Exchange Systems are reflected net in net cash contributions from (distributions to) Comcast in the accompanying combined statements of invested equity.
Accounts payable and other payments
 Certain assets are purchased centrally and warehoused by Comcast, and are shipped to the operating cable systems on an as-needed basis. Additionally, in the normal course of business, inventory items or customer premise equipment may be transferred between cable systems based on customer demands, rebuild requirements, and other factors. The operating cable systems, including the Exchange Systems, are charged for these assets based on historical cost value paid by the acquiring system.
Fixed asset and inventory transfers
Programming Costs & Incentives
We purchase programming content, and receive launch incentives, from certain of Comcast Corporation's content subsidiaries, and from certain parties in which Comcast Corporation has a direct financial interest or other indirect relationship. The amounts recorded for launch incentives, programming expenses and launch amortization as of December 31 2005 and 2004, and for the three years in the period ending December 31, 2005, for content purchased from related parties, are as follows:

THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND 2005
 
1. BUSINESS
Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") is a Pennsylvania corporation, incorporated in December 2001. Comcast is principally involved in the development, management and operation of broadband communications networks in the United States. Comcast's cable operations served approximately 21.7 million video subscribers as of June 30, 2006.
In April 2005, Comcast entered into agreements with Time Warner, Inc. ("Time Warner") to (i) jointly acquire substantially all of the assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia"); (ii) redeem Comcast's interest in Time Warner Cable ("TWC") and its subsidiary, Time Warner Entertainment ("TWE"); and (iii) exchange certain cable systems with Time Warner Cable ("proposed transactions"). The proposed transactions have been subject to customary regulatory review and approvals, including court approval in the Adelphia Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, which has now been obtained. In July 2006, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") approved the proposed transactions which represented the last federal approval needed in order to close the proposed transactions. The proposed transactions closed on July 31, 2006.
The accompanying special purpose combined financial statements represent the financial position and results of operations for Los Angeles, Dallas and Cleveland cable systems being exchanged with Time Warner (the "Exchange Systems"). Within these financial statements "we," "us" and "our" refers to the Exchange Systems. The Exchange Systems served approximately 1.1 million video subscribers as of July 31, 2006.
2. COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basis of Presentation
We have prepared these unaudited special purpose combined carve-out financial statements based upon Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods.
The accompanying special purpose combined carve-out financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Exchange Systems combined financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods shown, including normal recurring accruals and other items. The combined results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
The Exchange Systems are an integrated business of Comcast that operate in a single business segment and are not a stand-alone entity. The combined financial statements of the Exchange Systems reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Exchange Systems, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management, to present the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Exchange Systems on a stand-alone basis. The allocation methodologies have been described within the notes to the combined financial statements, where appropriate, and management considers the allocations to be reasonable. The financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Exchange Systems in the future or what they would have been had the Exchange Systems been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

Income Taxes
The income tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of a change in state tax law in Texas.
3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
SFAS No. 123R
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R") using the Modified Prospective Approach. See Note 6 for further detail regarding the adoption of this standard.
SFAS No. 155
In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrumentsan Amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140" ("SFAS No. 155"). SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative and that otherwise would require bifurcation to be accounted for as a whole on a fair value basis, at the holders' election. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have a material impact on our combined financial condition or results of operations.
FASB Interpretation No. 48
In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FIN 48 and the impact this interpretation may have on our combined financial statements.
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108
In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements." SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a potential current year financial statement misstatement. Specifially, the SAB articulates the SEC's position that registrants should quantify the effects of prior period errors using both a balance sheet approach ("iron curtain method") and an income statement approach ("rollover method") and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We are evaluating the requirements of SAB 108, however, we do not expect the adoption of SAB 108 to have a material impact on our combined financial condition or results of operations.

4. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT
As of June 30, 2006, we have a 20% investment in Adlink, an entity that operates the adsales interconnect in the Los Angeles area and that serves our Los Angeles cable system. The Adlink investment is accounted for under the equity method as a result of our proportionate ownership interest and our ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies. Summarized financial information for Adlink is as follows:
The carrying amount of our investment in Adlink exceeded our proportionate interests in the book value of the investees' net assets by $2.1 million and $4.4 million as of June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. This difference relates to contract-based intangible assets and is being amortized to equity in net loss of affiliates over the term of the underlying contract which expires in 2008.
5. FRANCHISE RIGHTS
Comcast evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually during the second quarter of each year or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Comcast estimates the fair value of its goodwill and cable franchise rights primarily based on discounted cash flow analyses, multiples of income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, analyses of current market transactions, and profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value.

LOS ANGELES, DALLAS & CLEVELAND CABLE SYSTEM OPERATIONS (A CARVE-OUT OF COMCAST CORPORATION)
THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND 2005
 
In connection with Comcast Corporation's annual evaluation of its goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, it was determined that the carrying value of the cable franchise rights exceeded their fair value for the Exchange Systems by approximately $9 million. The excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the cable franchise rights is reflected as an impairment loss in the accompanying combined statements of operations.
6. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS No. 123R using the Modified Prospective Approach, accordingly, we have not adjusted 2005 or prior years upon the adoption. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123") and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"). SFAS No. 123R requires the cost of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date, or the date of later modification, over the requisite service period. In addition, SFAS No. 123R requires unrecognized cost (based on the amounts previously disclosed in our pro forma footnote disclosure) related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized in the financial statements over the remaining requisite service period.
Under the Modified Prospective Approach, the amount of compensation cost recognized includes: (i) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and (ii) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recognized the majority of our share-based compensation costs using the accelerated recognition method. Upon adoption, we recognize the cost of previously granted share-based awards under the accelerated recognition method and recognize the cost of new share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The incremental pre-tax share-based compensation expense recognized due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2006 was $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Total share-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123R, including the incremental pre-tax share-based compensation expense above, was $1.0 million, with an associated tax benefit of $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006, and $2.0 million, with an associated tax benefit of $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively. The amount of share-based compensation capitalized was not material to our combined financial statements.
SFAS No. 123R also required us to change the classification, in our combined statements of cash flows, of any tax benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options or issuance of restricted share unit awards in excess of that which is associated with the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes.
Prior to January 1, 2006 we accounted for our share-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying Comcast Corporation stock at the date of grant. Had the fair value-based method as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 been applied, additional pre-tax compensation expense of $1.0 million and $1.9 million would have been recognized for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, and the effect on net income would have been as follows:

THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND 2005
 
Comcast Corporation Option Plans
Comcast Corporation maintains stock option plans for certain employees under which fixed price stock options may be granted and the option price is generally not less than the fair value of a share of the underlying Comcast Corporation Class A or Class A Special common stock at the date of grant (collectively, the "Comcast Option Plans"). Options granted under the Comcast Option Plans generally have a term of 10 years and become exercisable between two and nine and one half years from the date of grant.
The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on a blend of implied and historical volatility of Comcast Corporation Class A common stock. Comcast Corporation uses historical data on exercises of stock options and other factors to estimate the expected term of the options granted. The risk free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value at date of grant of a Comcast Corporation Class A common stock option granted under the Comcast Option Plans during the six month period ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, was $10.62 and $13.30, respectively.
As of June 30, 2006, there was $5.1 million of total unrecognized, pre-tax compensation cost related to non-vested stock options. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.

Comcast Corporation Restricted Stock Plan
Comcast Corporation maintains a restricted stock plan under which certain employees and directors ("Participant") may be granted restricted share unit awards in Comcast Corporation Class A or Class A Special common stock. Awards of restricted share units are valued by reference to shares of common stock that entitle a Participant to receive, upon the settlement of the unit, one share of common stock for each unit. The awards vest annually, generally over a period not to exceed five years from the date of the award, and do not have voting rights.
The following table summarizes the weighted-average fair value at date of grant and the compensation expense recognized related to restricted share unit awards:
The total fair value of restricted share units vested during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2006 was $4 thousand and $467 thousand, respectively.
As of June 30, 2006, there was $4.0 million of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation cost related to non-vested restricted share unit awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two and one half years.
7. NOTES PAYABLE TO AFFILIATES
As of June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the Exchange Systems are a party to certain demand promissory notes payable to affiliates of Comcast. Interest recorded on these notes totaled $3.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, for the six months ending June 30, 2006 and 2005. The principal amount of the notes, and the related interest accrued thereon have been reflected in Notes Payable to Affiliates in the accompanying combined balance sheets.

8. COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies
At Home Cases
Under the terms of the AT&T Broadband acquisition, Comcast Corporation is contractually liable for 50% of any liabilities of AT&T relating to certain At Home litigation. AT&T will be liable for the other 50%. Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, two actions brought by At Home's bondholders' liquidating trust against AT&T (and not naming Comcast Corporation): (i) a lawsuit filed against AT&T and certain of its senior officers in Santa Clara, California state court alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties, misappropriation of trade secrets and other causes of action and (ii) an action filed against AT&T in the District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that AT&T infringed an At Home patent by using its broadband distribution and high-speed internet backbone networks and equipment.
In May 2005, At Home bondholders' liquidating trust and AT&T agreed to settle these two actions. Pursuant to the settlement, AT&T agreed to pay $340 million to the bondholders' liquidating trust. The settlement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, and these two actions were dismissed. As a result of the settlement by AT&T, Comcast Corporation recorded a $170 million charge to other income (expense), reflecting Comcast's portion of the settlement amount to AT&T in its financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2005. Other expense for the six months ended June 30, 2005, includes a $20.3 million charge associated with the allocation of the At Home settlement.
Other
We are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our combined financial position, but could possibly be material to our combined results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our combined financial position.
9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Exhibit 99.5
     On July 31, 2006, Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner," or the "Company"), consummated the following transactions with Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia") and Comcast Corporation ((together with its subsidiaries) "Comcast"):
     . TWC acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from Adelphia for approximately $8.9 billion in cash and 16% of TWC's common stock. On the same day, Comcast purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from Adelphia for approximately $3.6 billion in cash. Together, TWC and Comcast, through certain of their subsidiaries and affiliates, purchased substantially all of the cable assets of Adelphia (the "Adelphia Acquisition"). On the same day as the Adelphia Acquisition, TWC and Comcast consummated the "Redemptions" and the "Exchange" as described below.
Adelphia Acquisition
     . Following the Adelphia Acquisition, TWC and Comcast exchanged certain cable systems (the "Exchange"). The estimated fair value of the cable systems transferred to Comcast by TWC and transferred to TWC by Comcast was approximately $8.7 billion. The Exchange was undertaken in order to enhance TWC and Comcast's respective geographic clusters of subscribers. With the exception of one system (Urban Cable Works of Philadelphia, L.P. ("Urban Cable Works")), all of the systems TWC transferred to Comcast in the Exchange were acquired from Adelphia in the Adelphia Acquisition.
The Exchange
     . Immediately prior to the Adelphia Acquisition, TWC and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. ("TWE"), one of TWC's subsidiaries, redeemed Comcast's interests in TWC (17.9%) and TWE (4.7%), respectively, for stock in their respective subsidiaries that held a total of approximately $2.004 billion in cash and historical cable systems serving approximately 751,000 basic video subscribers (as of June 30, 2006), all of which were historical cable systems of TWC or TWE, as applicable (the "TWC Redemption" and the "TWE Redemption," respectively, and, collectively, the "Redemptions").
The Redemptions
     The Adelphia Acquisition, the Redemptions and the Exchange are collectively referred to as the "Transactions."
     . On July 3, 2006, TWC and Comcast commenced the dissolution of Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners L.P. ("TKCCP"), a 50-50 joint venture between Time Warner Entertainment-Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("TWE-A/N") and Comcast. Upon the dissolution of TKCCP, TWC will acquire TKCCP's cable systems in Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico (the "Kansas City Pool") and Comcast will acquire TKCCP's cable systems in Houston (the "Houston Pool"). All of TKCCP's approximately $2.0 billion in debt will be assumed by the Houston Pool. The Partnership Agreement provides that, while formal dissolution is pending, TWC's interest in TKCCP will track the rights, risks and rewards associated with the Kansas City Pool and Comcast's interest will track the same with respect to the Houston Pool. The dissolution is subject to certain regulatory approvals, which are expected to be received no later than the first quarter of 2007. TWC will begin to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of the Kansas City Pool upon the consummation of the dissolution of TKCCP. As discussed further below, because the Company believes that the dissolution of TKCCP is probable of occurring, the Company has included such information in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information. The dissolution of TKCCP is referred to herein as the "TKCCP Dissolution."
TKCCP Dissolution
     . The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical balance sheet of Time Warner as of June 30, 2006 is presented as if the Transactions and the TKCCP Dissolution had occurred on June 30, 2006. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations of Time Warner for the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the six months ended June 30, 2006 are presented as if the Transactions and the TKCCP Dissolution had occurred on January 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information is presented based on information available, is intended
Pro Forma Information
 
for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of and does not purport to represent what Time Warner's future financial condition or operating results will be after giving effect to the Transactions and the TKCCP Dissolution and does not reflect actions that may be undertaken by management in integrating these businesses (e.g., the cost of incremental capital expenditures). Additionally, this information does not reflect financial and operating benefits Time Warner expects to realize as a result of the Transactions and the TKCCP Dissolution.
     Time Warner's, Comcast's and Adelphia's independent registered public accounting firms have not examined, reviewed, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information presented herein and, accordingly, assume no responsibility for them.
     The following is a brief description of the amounts recorded under each of the column headings in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical balance sheet and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations:
Historical Time Warner
     This column reflects Time Warner's historical financial position as of June 30, 2006 and Time Warner's historical operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2006, and represents Time Warner's unaudited interim financial statements (as restated), prior to any adjustments for the Transactions and the TKCCP Dissolution. Time Warner's historical operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 are derived from Time Warner's audited financial statements (as restated) for the year ended December 31, 2005, and adjusted for certain operations presented as discontinued operations, the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("Statement") No. 123 (Revised), ("FAS 123R") and the change in accounting principle related to programming inventory (see Note 1), but prior to any adjustments for the Transactions and the TKCCP Dissolution.
"Share-Based Payment"
Historical Adelphia
     This column reflects Adelphia's historical financial position as of June 30, 2006 and Adelphia's historical operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2006, and represents Adelphia's unaudited interim financial statements, which were prepared by Adelphia, prior to any adjustments for the Transactions. The historical operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 represent Adelphia's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005, which were prepared by Adelphia, prior to any adjustments for the Transactions. This column includes amounts relating to systems that were not acquired by TWC, but instead were acquired by Comcast (as part of the Adelphia Acquisition or the Exchange) or will be retained by Adelphia and, thus, will be excluded from the Company's unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information through the adjustments made in the "Less Items Not Acquired" column described below.
Comcast Historical Systems
     This column represents the historical financial position as of June 30, 2006 and the historical operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2006 of the cable systems previously owned by Comcast in Dallas, Cleveland and Los Angeles, which were transferred to TWC in the Exchange (the "Comcast Historical Systems"), and represents Comcast's unaudited interim "Special-Purpose Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of the Los Angeles, Dallas & Cleveland Cable System Operations (A Carve-Out of Comcast Corporation)," which were prepared by Comcast. The historical operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 represent Comcast's audited annual "Special-Purpose Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of the Los Angeles, Dallas & Cleveland Cable System Operations (A Carve-Out of Comcast Corporation), which were prepared by Comcast, prior to any adjustments for the Transactions. This column includes certain allocated assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. This column also includes allocated amounts that were retained by Comcast and, thus, were not transferred to TWC in the Exchange and, therefore, will be excluded from the Company's unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information through the adjustments made in the "Less Items Not Acquired" column described below.
 
Less Items Not Acquired
     This column represents the unaudited historical financial position and the unaudited historical operating results of the Adelphia systems that were (i) received by TWC in the Adelphia Acquisition and then transferred to Comcast in the Exchange, (ii) acquired by Comcast in the Adelphia Acquisition and not transferred to TWC in the Exchange or (iii) retained by Adelphia after the Transactions. This column also includes certain allocated assets, liabilities and costs that were included in the Comcast Historical System financial information that were not acquired by TWC (collectively with the items in (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the "Items Not Acquired"). Specifically, the following items relate to the Comcast Historical Systems and the Adelphia systems acquired that were not transferred to TWC and, therefore, are included as part of this column:
Less Urban Cable Works
     This column reflects the unaudited historical financial position and the unaudited historical operating results related to the cable systems of Urban Cable Works, which were transferred by TWC to Comcast in the Exchange. Urban Cable Works is TWC's only historical system transferred to Comcast in the Exchange. Time Warner will recognize an after-tax gain of $26 million on this transfer. This gain is not reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations and will be reported in discontinued operations, commencing in the third quarter of 2006. All other systems transferred by TWC to Comcast in the Exchange were acquired by TWC from Adelphia in the Adelphia Acquisition and, accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized in connection with these transfers.
Subtotal of Net Acquired Systems
     This column represents the unaudited historical financial position and the unaudited historical operating results of the "Net Acquired Systems." This column includes the financial positions and operating results of "Historical Adelphia" and the "Comcast Historical Systems" less the historical financial position and the historical operating results of the Items Not Acquired and Urban Cable Works. This column does not include the historical financial position and historical operating results of Time Warner and is before the impact of pro forma adjustments.
Pro Forma Adjustments  Adelphia Acquisition & Exchange
     This column represents preliminary purchase accounting and other pro forma adjustments related to the consummation of the Adelphia Acquisition and the Exchange, as more fully described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information.
 
Redemptions
     This column represents the unaudited historical financial position and the unaudited historical operating results of TWC systems transferred to Comcast in the Redemptions. The Company will recognize a net after-tax gain of $936 million on this transfer. This gain is not reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations, and will be reported in discontinued operations, commencing in the third quarter of 2006.
Pro Forma Adjustments  Redemptions
     This column primarily represents preliminary purchase accounting adjustments and other pro forma adjustments related to the Redemptions, as more fully described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information.
TKCCP Dissolution
     This column reflects the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool that will occur upon the TKCCP Dissolution. TWC currently accounts for its interest in TKCCP under the equity method of accounting. The adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations reflect the reversal of historical equity income and the consolidation of the operations of the Kansas City Pool.
Intercompany Eliminations
     This column eliminates the intercompany transactions between Time Warner and the systems acquired or transferred in the Transactions or the TKCCP Dissolution. For example, the Company is eliminating revenue recognized by Home Box Office, Inc. ("HBO") or Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. that was paid by an Adelphia or Comcast system, which TWC has acquired in the Transactions. This column also adjusts for the transactions between Time Warner and those systems no longer consolidated as a result of the Exchange or the Redemptions.

Notes To Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Historical Financial Information
Note 1: Basis of Presentation
     In the first quarter of 2006, the Company retroactively adopted the provisions of FAS 123R and retroactively changed the accounting principles used to recognize programming inventory cost at HBO. In addition, in the first quarter of 2006, the Company reached agreements to sell certain businesses that qualified as discontinued operations. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical financial information for the year ended December 31, 2005 has been prepared assuming that the adoption of FAS 123R, the change in HBO's inventory methodology and the classification of certain businesses as discontinued operations were effective as of January 1, 2005. Set forth below is a reconciliation of certain financial information of Time Warner included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 13, 2006 to the column labeled "Historical Time Warner" in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005.
 
Note 2: Description of the Transactions
Contractual Purchase Price
     On July 31, 2006, TWC purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from Adelphia for a total of $8.935 billion in cash and shares representing 16% of TWC's common stock. The original cash cost of $9.154 billion was preliminarily reduced at closing by $219 million as a result of the contractual adjustments, which resulted in a net cash payment by Time Warner NY Cable LLC ("TWNY") a subsidiary of Time Warner and TWC of $8.935 billion for the Adelphia Acquisition. A summary of the purchase price is set forth below:
 
Exchange
     Immediately after the Adelphia Acquisition on July 31, 2006, TWC and Comcast exchanged certain cable systems with an estimated fair value of approximately $8.7 billion to enhance TWC's and Comcast's respective geographic clusters of subscribers. TWC paid Comcast a
 
contractual closing adjustment totaling $67 million related to the Exchange. The Exchange was accounted for by Time Warner as a purchase of cable systems from Comcast and a sale of TWC's cable systems to Comcast.
Redemptions
     Immediately prior to the Adelphia Acquisition on July 31, 2006, TWC and TWE, respectively, redeemed Comcast's interests in TWC and TWE, each of which was accounted for as an acquisition of a minority interest. Specifically, in the TWC Redemption, TWC redeemed Comcast's 17.9% interest in TWC for 100% of the capital stock of a subsidiary of TWC that held both cable systems serving approximately 589,000 subscribers (as of June 30, 2006), with an approximate fair value of $2.470 billion, and approximately $1.857 billion in cash. In addition, in the TWE Redemption, TWE redeemed Comcast's 4.7% residual equity interest in TWE for 100% of the equity interests in a subsidiary of TWE that held both cable systems serving approximately 162,000 subscribers (as of June 30, 2006), with an approximate fair value of $630 million, and approximately $147 million in cash. The transfer of cable systems as part of the Redemptions is a sale of cable systems for accounting purposes, and a $123 million pre-tax gain was recognized because of the excess of the estimated fair value of these cable systems over their book value. This gain is not reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations.
Financing Arrangements
     TWC incurred incremental debt and redeemable preferred equity of approximately $11.1 billion associated with the cash used in executing the Adelphia Acquisition, the Exchange, and the Redemptions. In connection with the TKCCP Dissolution, TWC will receive approximately $627 million of cash in repayment of outstanding loans TWC had made to TKCCP (which has been assumed by Comcast). The cash that will be received is assumed to be used to pay down TWC's existing credit facilities. The following table summarizes the adjustments recorded to arrive at the Time Warner pro forma long-term debt and redeemable preferred equity:
 
Note 3: Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Historical Balance Sheet Adjustments as of June 30, 2006  Adelphia Acquisition and Exchange
     The "Pro Forma Adjustments  Adelphia Acquisition and Exchange" column primarily represents the adjustments to reflect the consummations of the Adelphia Acquisition and the Exchange. Specifically, the pro forma adjustments relate to preliminary adjustments to allocate the purchase price paid by TWC in the Adelphia Acquisition and the Exchange, to reflect the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 
based on their fair values pursuant to the guidance in FASB Statement No. 141, "". The allocation of purchase price is based on a preliminary estimate and is subject to change based on the completion of a final third-party valuation analysis. In addition, no deferred taxes were established for the preliminary purchase accounting adjustments because the new book basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Adelphia Acquisition was equal to the tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Business Combinations
     The adjustments to the accompanying pro forma condensed combined historical balance sheet for the Adelphia Acquisition and the Exchange are as follows:
 
The pro forma adjustments above resulted in the following purchase price allocation for the Adelphia Acquisition and the Exchange:
 
 
 
     For accounting purposes, the Redemptions were treated by the Company as an acquisition of Comcast's minority interests in TWC and TWE, and a sale of the cable systems that were transferred to Comcast. Accordingly, the "Pro Forma Adjustments  Redemptions" column represents the preliminary purchase accounting adjustments related to Time Warner's acquisition of Comcast's minority interests in TWC and TWE. The purchase of the minority interest resulted in a reduction of goodwill (see note (f)), while the sale of the cable systems resulted in an after-tax gain of $936 million, which has been excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations. Included in the gain is a pre-tax gain of $123 million, which was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the systems acquired by Comcast in the Redemptions totaling $2.977 billion and the estimated fair value of $3.100 billion. The results of the systems acquired by Comcast in the Redemptions, including the gain described above, will be reflected as discontinued operations by Time Warner commencing in the third quarter of 2006.

Note 9: TKCCP Dissolution
     Time Warner will consolidate the Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico cable systems upon the consummation of the TKCCP Dissolution. Such amounts are reflected in the pro forma condensed combined historical financial information as the Company believes that the transaction is probable of occurring. The dissolution procedure commenced on July 3, 2006 and is subject to certain regulatory approvals, which are expected to be received no later than the first quarter of 2007. Upon the dissolution of TKCCP, TWC will receive the Kansas City Pool and Comcast will receive the Houston Pool. All debt of TKCCP (inclusive of debt provided by TWC and Comcast) has been allocated to the Houston Pool and has become the responsibility of Comcast. Time Warner will account for the TKCCP Dissolution as a sale of its 50% interest in the Houston Pool in exchange for acquiring an additional 50% interest in the Kansas City Pool. Time Warner will record a gain based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of TWC's 50% investment in the Houston Pool surrendered in connection with the TKCCP Dissolution. The preliminary after tax gain of $44 million is not reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined historical statements of operations.

If the indemnification provided for in this Article VII shall for any reason be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party, in respect of any Liability, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable under Section 7.1 or 7.2, as the case may be, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the aggregate Liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Issuer and the Stockholder in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations (the relative fault of the Issuer and the Stockholder to be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer or the Stockholder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission). The parties hereto acknowledge that in no event shall the obligation of any Indemnifying Party to contribute under this Section 7.4 exceed the amount that such Indemnifying Party would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under Section 7.1 or 7.2 had been available under the circumstances. The Issuer and the Stockholder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7.4. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

In the event any such loss or damage occurs, the applicable Transferor shall (at its expense) use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace or restore such lost or damaged property as soon as practicable and in any event prior to Closing (or, if such damaged property is not replaced or restored prior to Closing, Transferor shall indemnify Transferee for any Losses arising out of such unrepaired damage or unrestored property). If any loss or damage described in the first sentence of this Section 11.16(a) would result in such losses or damage of all Affiliated Transferors being equal to or exceeding $100,000,000 and is sufficiently substantial so as to preclude and prevent resumption of normal operations of any material portion of any Transferred System by the Outside Closing Date, Transferor Parent shall, to the extent reasonably practical, immediately notify Transferee Parent in writing of that fact (which notice shall, to the extent reasonably practical, specify with reasonable particularity the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof if known or reasonably ascertainable, and the insurance coverage related thereto), and Transferee Parent, at any time within ten days after receipt of such notice, may elect by written notice to Transferor Parent, to either (i) waive such defect and proceed toward consummation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (, that any such waiver shall also be deemed to be a waiver of any right to indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 11.16(a) or pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2, as applicable, for any breach of any (x) representation or warranty of Transferor Parent set forth in Article 4 or 5, as applicable, resulting from any such loss or damage or (y) covenant hereunder to the extent that compliance therewith is frustrated or made commercially impracticable as a result of such loss or damage) or (ii) terminate this Agreement, subject to Section 9.2. If Transferee Parent elects to so terminate this Agreement, Transferor Parent shall be discharged of any and all
provided
 
144
obligations hereunder, subject to Section 9.2. If Transferee elects to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such loss or damage and does so, there shall be no adjustment in the consideration payable to or by Transferee Parent on account of such loss or damage, but all insurance proceeds received or receivable by Transferor or its Affiliates as a result of the occurrence of the event resulting in such loss or damage, including any such proceeds received or receivable by Transferor Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement or the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement (as applicable), to the extent not already expended by the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates to restore or replace the lost or damaged Transferred Assets, except for any proceeds from business interruption insurance relating to the loss of revenue for any period through and including the Closing Date, shall be delivered by the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates to the applicable Transferee, or the rights to such proceeds shall be assigned by the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates to the applicable Transferee if not yet paid to the applicable Transferor or its Affiliates. The applicable Transferor shall pay any deductible required and/or the self-insured portion of any such loss with respect to all such insurance proceeds payable under any insurance policy held by Transferor or its Affiliates. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount.
               (b) If, prior to Closing in respect of Native Assets, or prior to Closing but after the Adelphia Closing in respect of Adelphia Assets, any material part of or interest in such Transferred Assets is taken or condemned as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or if a Governmental Authority having such power informs Transferor or any of its Affiliates that it intends to condemn or take all or any material part of the Transferred Assets of Transferor or any of its Affiliates (such event being called, in either case, a ""), then Transferee Parent may terminate this Agreement. If Transferee Parent does not elect to terminate this Agreement, (i) Transferee and its Affiliates shall have the sole right, in the name of Transferor and its Affiliates, if Transferee Parent so elects, to negotiate for, claim, contest and, subject to the Closing occurring, have Transferee receive all damages with respect to the Taking, (ii) Transferor shall be relieved of its obligation to convey directly or indirectly to Transferee such Transferor's Transferred Assets or interests that of the Taking if the Taking has occurred, (but shall convey to Transferee Parent any interest therein still held by Transferor Parent or its Affiliates and any replacement property acquired by Transferor Parent or its Affiliates), (iii) at Closing, such Transferor and its Affiliates shall assign to Transferee all of such Transferor's and its Affiliates' rights to all payments received or receivable with respect to such Taking, including any such payments received or receivable by Transferor or its Affiliates pursuant to the TWC/Adelphia Purchase Agreement or the Comcast/Adelphia Purchase Agreement (as applicable), and shall pay to such Transferee all such payments previously paid to such Transferor or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Taking (to the extent not already expended by Transferor or its Affiliates to restore or replace the Assets taken), and (iv) following Closing, Transferor and its Affiliates shall give Transferee and its Affiliates such further assurances of such rights and assignment with respect to the Taking as Transferee or its Affiliates may from time to time reasonably request. Any amounts received or receivable hereunder shall not be included in the Net Liabilities Adjustment Amount.
