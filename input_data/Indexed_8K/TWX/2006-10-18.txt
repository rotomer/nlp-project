Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. TWE Indenture On October 18, 2006, Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. (the "Company" or "Time Warner"), together with Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. ("TWE"), TW NY Cable Holding Inc. ("TWNYCH"), certain other subsidiaries of the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee, entered into the Tenth Supplemental Indenture to the Indenture, dated as of April 30, 1992, among TWE, TWC, certain other subsidiaries of the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (as amended through October 18, 2006, the "TWE Indenture"). A total of $3.2 billion aggregate principal amount of debt securities are currently outstanding under the TWE Indenture (collectively, the "TWE Bonds"). Pursuant to the Tenth Supplemental Indenture, TWNYCH fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the TWE Bonds. In addition, pursuant to the Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2004, among TWE, TWC, certain other subsidiaries of the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee, Time Warner NY Cable LLC ("TWNY"), a subsidiary of TWC, agreed to waive, for so long as it remained a general partner of TWE, the benefit of certain provisions in the TWE Indenture that provided that it would not have any liability for the TWE Bonds as a general partner of TWE (the "TWNY Waiver"). On October 18, 2006, TWNY contributed all of its general partnership interests in TWE to TWE GP Holdings LLC, its wholly owned subsidiary, and as a result, the TWNY Waiver, by its terms, ceased to be in effect. TWC Credit Facilities On October 18, 2006, TWNYCH executed and delivered unconditional guaranties of the obligations of TWC under TWC's $6.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and two $4.0 billion term loan facilities (collectively, the "TWC Credit Facilities") in substantially the form of the existing primary guaranties attached thereto. In addition, contemporaneously with the termination of the TWNY Waiver, TWNY was released from its guaranties of the obligations of TWC under the TWC Credit Facilities in accordance with the terms of the TWC Credit Facilities. The Company expects that TWC will implement the same guaranty structure with respect to its commercial paper program. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

NOW, THEREFORE, WITNESSETH: For and in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, and the purchase of the Securities by the Holders thereof, it is mutually agreed, for the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders of the Securities, as follows: ARTICLE ONE INCORPORATION OF PREVIOUS DOCUMENTS SECTION 101. Incorporation of Previous Documents. This Tenth Supplemental Indenture is a supplemental indenture within the meaning of the Indenture and shall be read together therewith, and shall have the same effect as though all the provisions thereof and hereof were contained in one instrument. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the provisions of the Indenture are incorporated herein by reference. SECTION 102. Definitions. Unless otherwise provided herein, the terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Indenture. SECTION 103. Governing Law. This Tenth Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. SECTION 104. Trustee. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this Tenth Supplemental Indenture, except as to the satisfaction of the Trustee with the form hereof. The recitals and statements herein are deemed to be those of the parties hereto other than the Trustee. ARTICLE TWO TWNYH GUARANTY The TWNYH Guaranty provided for in this Article Two shall become effective upon execution and delivery of this Tenth Supplemental Indenture by each of the parties hereto. For value received, TWNYH and, subject to the terms of the Indenture, its successors and assigns, hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of 3
Securities Outstanding as of the date hereof and any Securities heretofore issued and Outstanding which reference the applicability of this Guaranty (collectively, the "Guaranteed Securities"), and to the Trustee for itself and on behalf of each such Holder, the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium if any) and interest on such Guaranteed Securities, when and as the same become due and payable, whether at Stated Maturity, upon redemption or repayment, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, according to the terms of the Guaranteed Securities and of the Indenture. In case of the failure of TWE or any successor thereto to punctually pay any such principal, premium or interest, TWNYH hereby agrees to immediately cause any such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at Stated Maturity, upon redemption or repayment, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, as if such payment were made by TWE. TWNYH hereby agrees that as long as this Article Two is in effect, its obligations hereunder and under the Indenture shall be unconditional and absolute, irrespective of the identity of TWE, the validity, regularity or enforceability of any such Securities or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the granting of any waiver or consent by the Holder of any such Securities with respect to any provisions thereof, the recovery of any judgment against TWE or any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. TWNYH hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of TWE, any right to require that a proceeding be brought first against TWE, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that as long as this Article Two is in effect, this TWNYH Guaranty will not be discharged except by complete payment of the payment and other obligations contained in such Security or in this Article Two. TWNYH acknowledges and agrees for the benefit of the Trustee and such Holders that the Trustee and such Holders (in the case of an Event of Default under Section 501(1) or (2) of the Indenture) may directly and simultaneously proceed against TWNYH for the enforcement of this TWNYH Guaranty and against TWE (as Obligor). The obligations of TWNYH hereunder are independent of the obligations of TWE under the Guaranteed Securities and the Indenture, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against TWNYH hereunder whether or not (i) an action or proceeding is brought against TWE, (ii) TWE is joined in any such action or proceeding against TWNYH or (iii) the Trustee or such Holders have taken any action to collect or attempted to otherwise collect such obligations from TWE or any other Person liable therefor. Anything in this Article Two to the contrary notwithstanding, this TWNYH Guaranty is and shall be deemed to be a guaranty of payment, and not a guaranty of collection. If the Trustee or the Holder of any Guaranteed Security is required by any court or otherwise to return to TWE or any custodian, receiver, liquidator, trustee, 4
sequestrator or other similar official acting in relation to TWE, any amount paid to the Trustee or such Holder in respect of such Guaranteed Security, this TWNYH Guaranty, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. TWNYH further agrees, to the fullest extent that it may lawfully do so, that, as between itself, on the one hand, and Holders of Guaranteed Securities and the Trustee, on the other hand, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated to the extent provided in Article Five of the Indenture for purposes of this TWNYH Guaranty, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition existing under any applicable bankruptcy law preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby. No reference herein to the Indenture, and no provision of this Article Two or of the Indenture, shall alter or impair this TWNYH Guaranty, which is absolute and unconditional, as to the payment of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing in respect of the Securities referring to this TWNYH Guaranty. ARTICLE THREE ADDITION OF TWNYH AS A PARTY TO THE INDENTURE By execution of this Tenth Supplemental Indenture, TWNYH agrees that it shall be a party to, and shall be subject to, bound by and entitled to the benefits of, the Indenture as supplemented by this Tenth Supplemental Indenture until such time, if any, as the TWNYH Guaranty shall be terminated pursuant to Article Two hereof. This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. * * * * 5
