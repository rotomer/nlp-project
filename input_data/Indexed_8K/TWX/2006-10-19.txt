Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. On October 19, 2006, Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. (the "Company" or "Time Warner"), announced that its subsidiary, Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. ("TWE"), commenced a consent solicitation to amend certain provisions of the Indenture, dated as of April 30, 1992, among TWE, TWC, TW NY Cable Holding Inc., certain other subsidiaries of the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (as amended, the "TWE Indenture"). A total of $3.2 billion aggregate principal amount of debt securities are currently outstanding under the TWE Indenture (collectively, the "TWE Bonds"). The proposed amendments to the TWE Indenture, if adopted, will simplify the guaranty structure of the TWE Bonds and amend the reporting obligations under the TWE Indenture by (i) amending the existing guaranty of the TWE Bonds provided by TWC to provide a direct guaranty of the TWE Bonds by TWC, rather than a guaranty of the TW Partner Guaranties (as defined below), (ii) terminating the existing guaranties (the "TW Partner Guaranties") currently provided by American Television and Communications Corporation ("ATC") and Warner Communications Inc. ("WCI"), which entities are subsidiaries of Time Warner that no longer own any direct equity interest in TWE, and (iii) amending TWE's reporting obligations under the TWE Indenture to allow TWE to provide holders of the TWE Bonds with quarterly and annual reports that TWC (or any other ultimate parent guarantor, as described in the Consent Solicitation Statement for the consent solicitation) would be required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Securities Exchange Act"), if it were required to file such reports with the Commission in respect of the TWE Bonds pursuant to such section of the Securities Exchange Act, except that financial information for persons other than such reporting person, exhibits and officers' certifications may be omitted where such items are not actually required by law. If the proposed amendments to the TWE Indenture are adopted, the Company expects TWC to implement the same guaranty structure with respect to its commercial paper program and that the existing guaranties provided by ATC and WCI under TWC's revolving and term loan credit facilities will automatically terminate in accordance with the terms of such credit facilities, in each case, following the effectiveness of the amendments to the TWE Indenture. A copy of the press release issued by TWC announcing the commencement of the consent solicitation is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference. The information included in this report, including the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1, is provided to satisfy the public disclosure requirements of Regulation FD.
