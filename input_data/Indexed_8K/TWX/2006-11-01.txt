Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
     On November 1, 2006, Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner") issued a press release setting forth its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2006. A copy of Time Warner's press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. Time Warner does not intend for this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 to be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to be incorporated by reference into filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: November 1, 2006
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
Time Warner Inc.'s financial results described in this release reflect, among other things, the discontinued operations treatment of certain cable systems transferred to Comcast Corporation in connection with the redemption of Comcast's interests in Time Warner Cable Inc. and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. and the exchange of certain cable systems with Comcast. In addition, results for the three months ended September 30, 2006, include the impact of certain cable systems acquired from Adelphia Communications Corporation and Comcast Corporation since the closing of the transactions on July 31, 2006.
Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2006.
NEW YORK, November 1, 2006 
In making the announcement, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Parsons said: "Time Warner continues to build momentum and deliver value for our shareholders. This quarter's results position the Company to meet all of our full-year financial objectives. We're particularly encouraged by AOL's early progress in making the transition to an advertising-supported business. Just as importantly, Time Warner Cable is generating outstanding results, even while successfully integrating its newly acquired cable systems. In addition, our capital allocation efforts continue to drive incremental value  including our $20 billion share repurchase program as well as this year's more than $20 billion of acquisitions and almost $4 billion of announced or completed non-core asset divestitures."
Company Results
In the quarter, Revenues rose 7% over the same period in 2005 to $10.9 billion, led by growth at the Cable and Networks segments.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization climbed 16% to $2.9 billion, reflecting double-digit increases at the Cable and AOL segments as well as gains at the Networks and Publishing segments. This growth was offset partly by a decline at the Filmed Entertainment segment. Operating Income was up 1% to $1.7 billion.
For the first nine months, Cash Provided by Operations was $6.6 billion, and Free Cash Flow totaled $4.0 billion (reflecting a 50% conversion rate of Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization). As of September 30, 2006, Net Debt totaled $32.2 billion, up $16.1 billion from $16.1 billion at the end of 2005, reflecting, among other items, the closing of the Adelphia and Comcast transactions as well as the Company's share repurchase program.
Diluted Income per Common Share before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change was $0.33 for the three months ended September 30, 2006, compared to $0.18 in last year's third quarter. The current and prior year amounts included certain items affecting comparability that are
 
described in detail in the Consolidated Reported Net Income and Per Share Results section below. After adjusting for such items, diluted common share results were $0.19, up 12% from $0.17 in the prior year period.
Stock Repurchase Program Update
From the inception of its stock repurchase program through October 31, 2006, the Company has repurchased approximately 770 million shares of common stock for approximately $13.4 billion.
At existing price levels, the Company expects that it will purchase at least $15 billion of its common stock by the end of 2006 and the remainder of its $20 billion program in 2007.
 
Performance of Segments
The schedules below reflect Time Warner's performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, by line of business (in millions):
 
 
Presented below is a discussion of Time Warner's segments for the third quarter of 2006. Unless otherwise noted, the dollar amounts in parentheses represent year-over-year changes.
AOL
declined 3% ($58 million) to $2.0 billion, due to a 13% decrease ($210 million) in Subscription revenues, offset in part by a 46% increase ($151 million) in Advertising revenues. The decline in Subscription revenues was due primarily to a decrease in domestic AOL brand subscribers, which reflects in part AOL's previously announced plan to offer its e-mail, certain software and other products free of charge to broadband users in the U.S. Advertising revenues reflected strong growth in sales of advertising run on third-party websites generated by Advertising.com, as well as display and paid-search advertising.
Revenues
rose 21% ($98 million) to $563 million. This performance reflects a 10% decline in total costs, including higher traffic acquisition costs, and solid growth in Advertising revenues, offset partially by lower Subscription revenues. The decrease in costs, compared to the prior year period, is related primarily to AOL's decision to prioritize its advertising business, which resulted in lower marketing expenses ($177 million), due mainly to reduced subscriber acquisition spending, offset partly by higher restructuring charges ($25 million).
Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
grew 38% ($109 million) to $397 million, due to higher Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization as well as lower depreciation and amortization expenses ($11 million).
Operating Income
Highlights
During the third quarter, AOL had 112 million average monthly domestic unique visitors and nearly 49 billion domestic page views, according to comScore Media Metrix, which translates into 145 average monthly page views per unique visitor.
As of September 30, 2006, the AOL service had 15.2 million U.S. subscribers, a decline of 2.5 million from the prior quarter and 4.9 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting in part an acceleration of subscriber losses due to AOL's strategy to prioritize its advertising business. In Europe, the AOL service had 5.5 million subscribers as of September 30, 2006, a decrease of 159,000 from the previous quarter and a decline of 632,000 from last year's quarter.
On October 31, 2006, Time Warner sold AOL's Internet access business in France for approximately $365 million. In addition, the Company recently announced separate agreements to sell AOL's Internet access businesses in Germany and the U.K. for approximately $870 million and $688 million, respectively. The contractual sales prices for these two transactions are denominated in euros and British pounds, respectively, and, consequently, the U.S. dollar amounts presented are subject to change as a result of fluctuation in the currency exchange rates. These remaining transactions, which are subject to customary regulatory approvals, are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006 or the first quarter of 2007.
CABLE
(Time Warner Cable)
rose 44% ($982 million) to $3.2 billion, including Subscription revenue growth of 44% ($928 million) and an increase in Advertising revenue of 44% ($54 million). These results reflected primarily the impact of the acquisition of certain cable systems from Adelphia and Comcast on July 31, 2006. In addition, Subscription revenues were driven by the continued penetration of high-speed data, Digital Phone and advanced digital video services.
Revenues
 
climbed 28% ($248 million) to $1.1 billion, benefiting from the cable systems acquired from Adelphia and Comcast as well as the growth in advanced services. These results also include merger-related and restructuring charges of $22 million, related mostly to the acquired cable systems. Average monthly subscription revenue per basic cable subscriber rose 9% to approximately $89.
Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
grew 17% ($79 million) to $550 million, due to the increase in Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization, offset partly by higher depreciation ($130 million) and amortization ($39 million) expenses.
Operating Income
Highlights
On July 31, 2006, a Time Warner Cable subsidiary, together with Comcast, acquired substantially all of the cable systems of Adelphia, and Comcast's interests in Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. were redeemed. These transactions resulted in the net addition of approximately 3.2 million basic video subscribers and 7.6 million homes passed. In addition, the transactions added 1.6 million digital subscribers and 1.2 million residential high-speed data subscribers. On July 31, 2006, there was no product comparable to Time Warner Cable's Digital Phone product available in the acquired systems.
As of September 30, 2006, Time Warner Cable managed 13.5 million basic video subscribers, which included 782,000 unconsolidated subscribers in the Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico cable systems. During the quarter, Time Warner Cable's historical cable systems performed well, generating year-over-year increases in net additions of basic video subscribers, digital video subscribers and high-speed data subscribers. The increase of 33,000 basic video subscribers in the historical Time Warner Cable systems represents a 50% increase compared to the increases in the prior year quarter as well as in the second quarter of 2006. In the acquired systems, basic video subscribers declined by 30,000 during the quarter. Digital video subscribers were 7.0 million at the end of the quarter, representing an increase of 143,000 subscribers in the historical systems and a decline of 7,000 in the acquired systems. Digital penetration of basic video customers was 52% at the end of the quarter. Digital Video Recorder subscribers ended the quarter at 2.2 million subscribers, representing 31% of digital customers.
Residential high-speed data subscribers rose by 214,000 in Time Warner Cable's historical systems. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter in which net subscriber additions surpassed 200,000. In addition, residential high-speed data subscribers increased by 37,000 in the acquired systems. Total residential high-speed data subscribers at the end of the quarter were 6.4 million, representing approximately 25% of service-ready homes passed. Digital Phone subscribers grew by 187,000 in the quarter for a total of 1.6 million, representing approximately 11% of service-ready homes passed. For additional subscriber and homes passed information, refer to the subscriber and homes passed reconciliation schedule included in Note 2.
FILMED ENTERTAINMENT (
Warner Bros. Entertainment & New Line Cinema
)
decreased 10% ($260 million) to $2.4 billion, due to difficult comparisons to the prior year period. The current quarter included Revenues from the strong worldwide theatrical performance of , while overall theatrical revenue declined from the prior year quarter, which included results from Warner Bros.' and as well as New Line's

decreased 25% ($41 million) to $120 million, due to a decline in Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization as well as an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses ($8 million).
Operating Income
Highlights
Warner Home Video ranked #1 in home video sales in the U.S. for the year through September 30, 2006, with a 19.4% share.
Warner Bros. Television's and together earned six Primetime Emmys. Warner Home Video's , which premiered on Turner Classic Movies, also won an Emmy.
The New Adventures of Old Christine, The West Wing, E-Ring, Smallville
Two and a Half Men
Stardust: The Bette Davis Story
NETWORKS
(Turner Broadcasting, HBO and The WB Network)
rose 4% ($100 million) to $2.5 billion, reflecting higher Subscription and Advertising revenues, including the consolidation of Court TV ($60 million), offset partially by lower Content revenues. Subscription revenues climbed 9% ($125 million), due to higher rates and, to a lesser extent, increased subscribers at Turner and HBO as well as the consolidation of Court TV ($17 million). Advertising revenues were up 6% ($42 million), led by 16% growth at Turner, including Court TV ($42 million), offset partly by a 36% decrease ($48 million) at The WB Network, which ceased operations on September 17, 2006. The 23% decline in Content revenues ($72 million) is related to a decrease at HBO, due mainly to a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter, which included higher syndication sales of
Revenues
Sex and the City.
climbed 9% ($66 million) to $800 million, driven by the increase in Revenues and lower marketing expense, offset in part by higher programming and other operating expenses. The current quarter's results also include $38 million of shutdown costs at The WB Network.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
declined 21% ($141 million) to $526 million. Following the shutdown of The WB Network and the formation of The CW, the Company determined that the implied fair value of goodwill at The WB Network was lower than the carrying value. Accordingly, for the three months ended September 30, 2006, the Company recorded a pretax impairment charge of approximately $200 million to reduce the carrying value of The WB Network's goodwill. This item was offset in part by the increase in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization.

Highlights
Among advertising-supported cable networks, TNT finished the quarter ranked #1 in total-day delivery of Adults 18-49 and Adults 25-54. TNT's became advertising-supported cable's #1 original series of all time in Households and Persons 2+. For the quarter, TBS had four of the top five comedies on advertising-supported cable networks among Adults 18-49.

PUBLISHING
(Time Inc.)
rose 1% ($11 million) to $1.3 billion, reflecting an increase in Advertising revenues ($34 million), offset partly by a decline in Other revenues ($24 million). The growth in Advertising revenues was driven by higher online advertising revenues at CNNMoney.com and SI.com as well as gains in international magazines, due mainly to the addition of Grupo Editorial Expansin's titles. Additionally, Advertising revenues benefited from gains at certain domestic magazines, particularly and as well as recent magazine launches. The decrease in Other revenues was due largely to lower commerce revenues at Synapse and Southern Living at Home as well as a decline in licensing revenues from AOL.

Real Simple,
grew 3% ($9 million) to $270 million, including increases at international and domestic magazines as well as lower start-up losses, offset partially by declines at the non-magazine businesses, particularly Synapse.
Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
climbed 8% ($17 million) to $226 million, reflecting an increase in Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization as well as declines in depreciation and amortization expenses ($8 million).
Operating Income
Highlights
Based on Publishers Information Bureau (PIB) data, Time Inc.'s 2006 industry-leading share of overall domestic advertising through September 30, 2006, was 22.5%.
Consolidated Reported Net Income and Per Share Results
For the three months ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported Net Income of $2.3 billion, or $0.57 per diluted common share. This compares to Net Income in 2005 of $853 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share.
For the three months ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported Income before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change of $1.4 billion, or $0.33 per diluted common share. This compares to Income before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change in 2005 of $827 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share.
Certain pretax items in the current year quarter affected comparability, including $729 million of net investment gains related to the sale of the Company's interests in Time Warner Telecom and Warner Bros.' Australian theme parks. In addition, the quarter included a $373 million tax benefit primarily associated with the realization of net capital loss carryforwards, offset in part by $29 million in net expenses related to securities litigation and government investigations. The Company also determined that the implied fair value of goodwill at The WB Network was lower than the carrying value. Accordingly, for the three months ended September 30, 2006, the Company recorded a pretax impairment charge of approximately $200 million to reduce the carrying value of The WB Network's goodwill. Certain pretax items in the prior year quarter similarly affected comparability, including $16 million of net expenses related to the securities litigation and government investigations, offset partly by $10 million in net investment gains. The year-ago
 
quarter also included a $16 million tax benefit associated with the realization of net capital loss carryforwards.
In the aggregate, these items had the net effect of increasing the current year quarter's Income before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change by $590 million (net of taxes), or $0.14 per diluted common share, and increasing the prior year quarter by $15 million (net of taxes), or $0.01 per diluted common share. Excluding such items, Income before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change reflected an increase in Operating Income, offset by higher depreciation, amortization and interest expenses related to the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. The growth in Diluted Income per Common Share before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change was driven by the Company's share repurchase program.
Use of Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow
The Company utilizes Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. The Company also evaluates the performance of its businesses using Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets, as well as gains and losses on asset sales, and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations (referred to herein as Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization). Both Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company's businesses. Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of noncash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Moreover, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization does not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations or any impairment charge related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. Management evaluates the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Free Cash Flow is Cash Provided by Operations (as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries) and excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, less cash flow attributable to discontinued operations, capital expenditures and product development costs, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate the performance of its businesses and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends to common shareholders and repurchase stock. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect payments made in connection with the securities litigation and government investigations, which reduce liquidity.
Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's Operating Income (Loss), Net Income and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Note 1: Changes in Basis of Presentation
The 2005 consolidated financial statements have been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of 2006. As previously disclosed, the amounts have been recast for the retroactive adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), ("FAS 123R"), a retroactive change in accounting principle for recognizing programming inventory costs at HBO and the sales of the Time Warner Book Group and the Turner South Network in the first and second quarters of 2006, respectively, which have been retroactively reflected as discontinued operations. In addition, in the third quarter, the Company closed on the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia") (the "Adelphia Acquisition") and the related exchange of cable systems with Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") (the "Exchange") and the redemption of Comcast's interest in Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC") and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (collectively, the "Redemptions"). The cable systems transferred to Comcast in connection with the Redemptions and the Exchange (the "Transferred Systems"), including gains recognized on the transfers, also have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Share-Based Payment
Note 2: Cable Subscriber and Homes Passed Information
In connection with the Adelphia Acquisition, the Exchange and the Redemptions, TWC acquired approximately 3.2 million net basic video subscribers consisting of approximately 4.0 million acquired subscribers and approximately 795,000 subscribers transferred to Comcast in the Redemptions and the Exchange. Prior to the third quarter of 2006, homes passed and subscriber numbers included consolidated entities and an equity method investee (Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. ("TKCCP")) that were managed by TWC. Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the Company has revised its cable homes passed and subscriber numbers to now include consolidated entities and only the managed subscribers TWC will receive in the dissolution of TKCCP. At September 30, 2006, the TKCCP basic video subscribers that are no longer included in the subscriber metric totaled approximately 791,000. In the following table, the numbers as of June 30, 2006 have been recast to reflect this change and to exclude amounts related to the Transferred Systems which have been reflected as discontinued operations. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of certain subscriber and homes passed information for the systems TWC held before and retained after the Adelphia Acquisition, the Exchange and the Redemptions (the "Historical TWC Systems") and the systems acquired from Adelphia and Comcast (the "Acquired Systems") for the three months ended September 30, 2006 (in thousands):
