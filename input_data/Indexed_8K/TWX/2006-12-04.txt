Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. On December 4, 2006, Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a new unsecured commercial paper program (the "New Program") to replace its existing $2.0 billion commercial paper program (the "Prior Program"). The New Program provides for the issuance of up to $6.0 billion of commercial paper at any time, and TWC's obligations under the New Program will be guaranteed by TW NY Cable Holding Inc. and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. ("TWE"), both subsidiaries of TWC, while TWC's obligations under the Prior Program are guaranteed by American Television and Communications Corporation and Warner Communications Inc. (both subsidiaries of the Company but not of TWC) and TWE. Commercial paper borrowings under the Prior Program and the New Program are supported by the unused committed capacity of TWC's $6.0 billion senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility that matures on February 15, 2011. No new commercial paper will be issued under the Prior Program after December 4, 2006. Amounts currently outstanding under the Prior Program have not been modified by the changes reflected in the New Program and will be repaid on the original maturity dates. Once all outstanding commercial paper under the Prior Program has been repaid, the Prior Program will terminate. Until all commercial paper outstanding under the Prior Program has been repaid, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding under the Prior Program and the New Program will not exceed $6.0 billion at any time.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
