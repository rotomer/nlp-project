Item 1.01.
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 8, 2008, Time Warner Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company or Time Warner), entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), among the Company, as borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A. and Fortis Capital Corp., as Co- Syndication Agents, and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as Co-Documentation Agents, for a $2.0 billion three-year term loan facility (the Term Facility), which was fully drawn at the time of closing.  
The Term Facility has a maturity date of January 8, 2011. Amounts outstanding under the Term Facility will bear interest at a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin, which is based on the credit rating of Time Warner. As of January 8, 2008, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 0.45% per annum. The Companys obligations under the Term Facility are guaranteed by TW AOL Holdings Inc. and Historic TW Inc. (Historic TW). In addition, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. and Time Warner Companies, Inc. guarantee the obligations of Historic TW under the Term Facility.
The Term Facility contains a maximum leverage coverage ratio covenant of 4.5 times the consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of Time Warner. The Term Facility also contains certain events of default customary for credit facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable). If any events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, the outstanding loans may be accelerated.
The Company will use the proceeds from the Term Facility for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions, repurchases of the common stock of the Company, and the repayment of indebtedness. The Company intends to use substantially all of the net proceeds from the Term Facility in the near-term to repay existing short-term borrowings as they become due.  
Certain of the lenders under the Term Facility and their affiliates have performed and may, from time to time in the future, engage in transactions with and perform commercial and investment banking and advisory services for the Company and its subsidiaries, including Time Warner Cable Inc., for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
The foregoing description of the Term Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

SECTION 2.03.       . To request the Lenders to make the Loans on the anticipated Effective Date, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone in accordance with Schedule 2.03(A). Such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(b)     
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Effective Date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent shall have the right to demand payment from the applicable Lender and/or the Borrower and they each severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Alternate Base Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate that would otherwise apply to such Borrowing.

(b)     
To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time set forth in Schedule 2.03(A) with respect to the Type of Borrowing to result from such election.

(c)      Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)     
the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
 
(ii)      the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)      whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
 
(iv)      if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
(d)     
Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(e)      If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, as the case may be, having a one month Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Prepayment of Loans
(a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section. Amounts prepaid on account of the Loans may not be reborrowed.
that, a notice of prepayment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.

(b)     
The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
 
(c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as
 
 
 
(d)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon the Maturity Date.
provided
 
(e)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year). The Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate and LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Alternate Rate of Interest
 
(a)     
the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate; or
 
(b)      the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall be ineffective and any such Borrowing referred to in such Interest Election Request shall, unless repaid by the Borrower, be converted to (as of the last day of the then current Interest Period), or maintained as, an ABR Borrowing, as the case may be (to the extent, in the Administrative Agents reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and (ii) if the Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall, unless otherwise rescinded by the Borrower, be made as an ABR Loan (to the extent, in the Administrative Agents reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect fewer than all Types of Borrowings, then the other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted.

impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
 
(ii)      impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs actually incurred or reduction actually suffered. 
(b)     
If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction actually suffered in respect of the Loans made by such Lender hereunder.
 
(c)      A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions unless a Lender gives notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to pay an amount under this Section within six months after the later of (i) the date such Lender incurs such increased costs, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital or (ii) the date such Lender has actual knowledge of its incurrence of such increased cost, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

A certificate as
 
 
 
to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(c)      If a Lender or the Administrative Agent receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund, as determined by such Lender in its reasonable discretion), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant taxation authority with respect to such refund); that the Borrower, upon the request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxation authority) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such taxation authority.
provided
 
(d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents.

After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Lenders constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness
 
 
. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 9.07.      
Severability
. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket expenses.
SECTION 9.08.      
Withholding Tax
. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender that is primarily engaged in commercial banking activities and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any of the Credit Parties (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all the obligations of any of the Credit Parties now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

(d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

provided
.

If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine.
5.     
No Subrogation
 
6.     .

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto.

7.    . Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and/or any of the Historic TW Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee; and all dealings between the Borrower or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any Guarantor with respect to the Obligations or the Historic TW Obligations. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, any of the Obligations or the Historic TW Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or the Guarantors) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower from the Obligations or Historic TW from the Historic TW Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making a demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against either the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or the Historic TW Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof demand shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional
 
8.   . This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations or any of the Historic TW Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or Historic TW or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or Historic TW or any substantial part of the Borrowers or Historic TWs property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
Reinstatement
 
 
9.   . Each Guarantor hereby agrees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without setoff or counterclaim at the office of the Administrative Agent as designated by the Administrative Agent.
