NEW YORK, February 6, 2008

Looking ahead, we've identified key initiatives that will enable us to deliver strong business results long into the future while increasing our returns to our shareholders. Specifically, we'll intensify our creative and entrepreneurial focus to move our businesses ahead more quickly. We'll aggressively control costs to help fund our investments in future growth.

Full-Year Results
Revenues rose 6% over 2006 to $46.5 billion, reflecting primarily increases at the Company's Cable, Filmed Entertainment and Networks segments.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization climbed to $12.9 billion, up 17% from $11.0 billion in the prior year, driven by a 36% increase at Time Warner Cable and gains at each of the Company's other segments. Operating Income rose 23% to $8.9 billion in 2007 from $7.3 billion in 2006, reflecting growth in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization and lower costs associated with securities litigation and government investigations, offset partly by increased depreciation expense.
Cash Provided by Operations totaled $8.5 billion and Free Cash Flow equaled $5.0 billion (reflecting a 38% conversion rate of Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization). As of December 31, 2007, Net Debt totaled $35.6 billion, up $2.2 billion from $33.4 billion at the end of 2006, due primarily to the Company's stock repurchase programs.
Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $1.08 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.20 in 2006. The current and prior year amounts included certain items affecting comparability that are described in detail in the Consolidated Reported Net Income and Per Share Results section below. The net impact of such items was to increase the current and prior year results by $0.12 and $0.40 per diluted common share, respectively.
Fourth-Quarter Results
Fourth-quarter revenues were up 2% over the same period in 2006 to $12.6 billion, driven mainly by increases at the Cable and Filmed Entertainment segments.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization climbed 16% to $3.5 billion, benefiting from increases at the Cable, Filmed Entertainment, AOL and Publishing segments. Operating Income grew 12% to $2.3 billion, reflecting the increase in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization and lower costs associated with securities litigation and government investigations, offset in part by lower gains on asset sales.
Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $0.28 for the three months ended December 31, 2007, compared to $0.43 in last year's fourth quarter. The current and prior year amounts included certain items affecting comparability that are described in detail in the Consolidated Reported Net Income and Per Share Results section below. The net impact of such items was to decrease the
 
current year results by $0.01 per diluted common share and to increase the prior year results by $0.21 per diluted common share.
Stock Repurchase Program Update
From the announcement of the $5 billion stock repurchase program on August 1, 2007, through February 5, 2008, the Company has repurchased approximately 154 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.8 billion.

Presented below is a discussion of Time Warner's segments for the 2007 full year and fourth quarter. Unless otherwise noted, the dollar amounts in parentheses represent year-over-year changes.
AOL
Full-Year Results
declined 33% ($2.6 billion) to $5.2 billion, due to a 52% decrease ($3.0 billion) in Subscription revenues, offset in part by an 18% increase ($345 million) in Advertising revenues. The decline in Subscription revenues resulted from the sales of AOL's Internet access businesses in the U.K., France and Germany ($1.5 billion), as well as a decrease in domestic AOL brand subscribers, which reflects partially AOL's previously announced strategy to offer its e-mail, certain software and other products free of charge to Internet consumers. Advertising revenues benefited from growth in sales of advertising on third-party Internet sites (referred to as the "Third Party Network"), as well as in display and paid-search advertising on the AOL Network.
Revenues
increased 4% ($66 million) to $1.8 billion, due primarily to reductions in expenses, including network ($888 million) and marketing ($802 million) expenses, and higher Advertising revenues, offset partly by lower Subscription revenues. The current and prior year results also included restructuring charges of $125 million and $222 million, respectively.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
grew 6% ($119 million) to $2.0 billion, due mainly to higher Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization, as well as lower depreciation ($93 million) and amortization ($37 million) expenses. Additionally, the current year included a net pretax gain of $668 million on the sale of AOL's German Internet access business and the prior year included a pretax gain of $769 million on the sales of AOL's U.K. and French Internet access businesses.
Operating Income
Fourth-Quarter Results
decreased 32% ($587 million) to $1.3 billion. increased 29% ($86 million) to $381 million. The current and prior year quarters reflected restructuring charges of $98 million and $179 million, respectively. declined 70% ($636 million) to $274 million, due primarily to the sales of AOL's Internet access businesses in the U.K. and France, which generated a pretax gain of $769 million in the year-ago period, offset partly by higher Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization.

Highlights
During the fourth quarter, AOL had 109 million average monthly domestic unique visitors and 49 billion domestic page views, according to comScore Media Metrix, which translates into 150 average monthly domestic page views per unique visitor.
As of December 31, 2007, the AOL service had 9.3 million U.S. access subscribers, a decline of 740,000 from the prior quarter and 3.8 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting subscriber losses due to AOL's strategy to prioritize its advertising business.
CABLE
(Time Warner Cable)
Basis of Presentation
On July 31, 2006, a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable, Time Warner NY Cable LLC ("TW NY"), acquired certain cable systems from Adelphia Communications Corporation, Comcast Corporation's ("Comcast") interests in Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. ("TWE") were redeemed,
4
 
and TW NY and Comcast also exchanged certain cable systems. Collectively, these acquisitions and dispositions are referred to as the "Adelphia/Comcast Transactions."
On January 1, 2007, Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. ("TKCCP"), an unconsolidated joint venture between Time Warner Cable and Comcast, distributed its assets to its partners. Time Warner Cable received the systems in Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico (the "Kansas City Pool"), which had approximately 855,000 customer relationships, including approximately 788,000 basic video subscribers, at December 31, 2006, and began consolidating the financial results of the Kansas City Pool on January 1, 2007.
For the presentation of subscriber information, the systems that Time Warner Cable acquired in the Adelphia/Comcast Transactions, which had approximately 4.1 million customer relationships, including approximately 3.7 million basic video subscribers, at December 31, 2007, are referred to as the "Acquired Systems." Those systems that Time Warner Cable owned both before and after the Adelphia/Comcast Transactions as well as the Kansas City Pool, which together had approximately 10.5 million customer relationships, including approximately 9.5 million basic video subscribers, at December 31, 2007, are referred to as the "Legacy Systems."
For the presentation of financial information, however, "Legacy Systems" refers only to those systems that Time Warner Cable owned both before and after the Adelphia/Comcast Transactions and does not include the Kansas City Pool. The "Acquired Systems" has the same definition as above.
As previously noted, on July 31, 2006, Time Warner Cable completed the Adelphia/Comcast Transactions and began consolidating the results of the Acquired Systems. Additionally, on January 1, 2007, Time Warner Cable began consolidating the results of the Kansas City Pool. Accordingly, the operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007, include the results for the Legacy Systems, the Acquired Systems and the Kansas City Pool for the full three- and twelve-month periods, and the operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, include the results of the Legacy Systems for the full three- and twelve-month periods and the Acquired Systems for the three- and five-month periods ended December 31, 2006, but do not include the consolidation of the results of the Kansas City Pool. The impact of the incremental seven months of revenues and expenses of the Acquired Systems on the results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, is referred to as the "impact of the Acquired Systems" in the discussion that follows.
Subscriber "net additions (declines)" reflect subscriber activity for any given period other than subscriber changes resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or exchanges during any given quarter of cable systems that, in the aggregate, served more than 5,000 basic video subscribers. Revenue generating units ("RGUs") represent the total of all basic video, digital video, high-speed data, Digital Phone and circuit-switched telephone service subscribers. Customer relationships represent the number of subscribers that receive at least one level of service, encompassing video, high-speed data and voice (including circuit-switched telephone) services, without regard to the number of services purchased.
Full-Year Results
rose 36% ($4.2 billion) to $16.0 billion. The year-over-year increase reflects the impact of the Acquired Systems, 9% growth in the Legacy Systems and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($877 million). Subscription revenues climbed 36% ($4.0 billion) to $15.1 billion, led by 33% growth in video revenues ($2.5 billion), a 35% increase in high-speed data revenues ($974 million) and a 67% rise in voice revenues ($478 million). This growth was driven by the impact of the Acquired Systems and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool, as well as the continued penetration of digital video services, video price increases and growth in high-speed data and Digital Phone subscribers. Advertising revenues increased 31% ($203 million) to $867 million, due mainly to the impact of the Acquired Systems, and, to a lesser extent, the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool ($42 million).
Revenues
5
 
climbed 36% ($1.5 billion) to $5.7 billion, reflecting revenue growth, offset partially by higher operating expenses, primarily video programming, employee, Digital Phone service and marketing costs. The current and prior year periods also included merger-related and restructuring charges of $23 million and $56 million, respectively.
Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
climbed 27% ($587 million) to $2.8 billion, reflecting the increase in Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization, offset partly by higher depreciation ($821 million) and amortization ($105 million) expenses. The increase in depreciation expense was due primarily to the impact of the Acquired Systems, the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool and an increase in recent years in demand-driven purchases of customer premise equipment, which generally has a shorter useful life compared to the mix of assets previously purchased. The increase in amortization expense was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets related to customer relationships associated with the Acquired Systems. This was offset partially by the absence after the first quarter of 2007 of amortization expense associated with customer relationships recorded in connection with the restructuring of TWE in 2003, which were fully amortized at the end of the first quarter of 2007.
Operating Income
Fourth-Quarter Results
rose 12% ($438 million) to $4.1 billion. grew 19% ($254 million) to $1.6 billion. The current year and prior year quarters included merger-related and restructuring charges of $3 million and $13 million, respectively. increased 26% ($162 million) to $795 million, as growth in Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization was offset partly by higher depreciation expense ($101 million).

Full-Year Results
rose 2% ($157 million) to $10.3 billion, benefiting from 7% ($390 million) growth in Subscription revenues, offset partially by an 11% ($115 million) decline in Content revenues and a 3% ($105 million) decrease in Advertising revenues. The rise in Subscription revenues resulted primarily from higher rates at both Turner and HBO and, to a lesser extent, increased subscribers at Turner. The decrease in Advertising revenues was due to the cessation of The WB Network's operations in September 2006, offset in part by a 9% increase at Turner. The decline in Content revenues was due mainly to a difficult comparison to the prior year at HBO, which included the recognition of higher revenues related to the domestic cable sale of

Consolidated Reported Net Income and Per Share Results
Full-Year Results
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported Net Income of $4.4 billion, or $1.17 per diluted common share. This compares to 2006 Net Income of $6.6 billion, or $1.55 per diluted common share.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported Income from Continuing Operations of $4.1 billion, or $1.08 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations in 2006 of $5.1 billion, or $1.20 per diluted common share.
Certain pretax items in the current year affected comparability, including a $668 million net gain on the sale of AOL's Internet access business in Germany and a $16 million gain on the sale of a building, as well as $341 million of net investment gains related primarily to the sales of Time Inc.'s interest in Bookspan and the Company's investment in Oxygen Media Corporation ("Oxygen"), as well as the distribution of the assets of TKCCP. In addition, the Company incurred $171 million in net expenses related to securities litigation and government investigations. The 2007 results also included $73 million and $57 million of noncash impairment charges related to Warner Bros.' investments in The CW Television Network ("The CW") and SCi Entertainment Group plc ("SCi"), respectively, and a $34 million noncash charge related to the impairment of the Court TV tradename. Lastly, the 2007 tax provision benefited from the utilization of $125 million of tax attribute carryforwards.
Certain pretax items in the prior year similarly affected comparability, including $1.0 billion of net investment gains related primarily to the sales of the Company's interests in Time Warner Telecom Inc., Warner Bros.' theme parks in Australia and Canal Satellite Digital, as well as a $769 million gain on the sales of AOL's Internet access businesses in the U.K. and France and a $20 million gain on the sale of two aircraft. In addition, the Company incurred $705 million in net expenses related to securities litigation, including the establishment of an additional reserve of $600 million in the fourth quarter.

Excluding such items, Income from Continuing Operations increased, reflecting growth in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization, offset partially by higher depreciation, amortization and interest expenses related to the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. Excluding such items, Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations increased in 2007 compared to 2006, driven by the rise in Income from Continuing Operations, as well as a decrease in average diluted common shares as a result of common stock repurchases made under the stock repurchase programs.
Fourth-Quarter Results
For the three months ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported Net Income of $1.0 billion, or $0.28 per diluted common share. This compares to Net Income in the 2006 comparable quarter of $1.8 billion, or $0.44 per diluted common share.

Certain pretax items in the current year quarter affected comparability, including a $56 million gain on the sale of the Company's investment in Oxygen and a $16 million gain on the sale of a building at the AOL segment, offset by $73 million and $57 million in noncash impairment charges related to Warner Bros.' investments in The CW and SCi, respectively. The quarter's tax provision included $43 million of tax benefits related primarily to the utilization of tax attribute carryforwards.
Certain pretax items in the prior year quarter similarly affected comparability, including a $769 million gain on the sales of AOL's Internet access businesses in the U.K. and France, offset in part by $13 million of noncash impairment charges at AOL. In addition, the Company established an additional reserve of $600 million related to securities litigation and incurred $15 million in securities litigation expenses. The quarter's tax provision included $909 million of tax benefits related primarily to the utilization of net capital loss carryforwards of $659 million and the reversal of $234 million of tax reserves associated with litigation settlements.
In the aggregate, these items had the net effects of decreasing the current year quarter's Income from Continuing Operations by $35 million (net of taxes), or $0.01 per diluted common share, and increasing the prior year quarter by $826 million (net of taxes), or $0.21 per diluted common share. Excluding such items, Income from Continuing Operations rose, reflecting growth in Adjusted Operating income before Depreciation and Amortization. Excluding such items, Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations increased in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the climb in Income from Continuing Operations, as well as a decrease in average diluted common shares as a result of common stock repurchases made under the stock repurchase programs.
Use of Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow
The Company utilizes Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. The Company also evaluates the performance of its businesses using Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets, as well as gains and losses on asset sales, and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations (referred to herein as Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization). Both Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization are considered important indicators of the
11
 
operational strength of the Company's businesses. Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of noncash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Moreover, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization does not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations or any impairment charge related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. Management evaluates the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Free Cash Flow is Cash Provided by Operations (as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries) and excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, less cash flow attributable to discontinued operations, capital expenditures and product development costs, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its businesses and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends to common shareholders and repurchase stock. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect payments made in connection with the securities litigation and government investigations, which reduce liquidity.
Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's Operating Income, Net Income and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company uses pro forma information to evaluate its financial performance when certain acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions occur. Historical information reflects the Company's financial results only after the acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions have occurred, while pro forma information enhances comparability of financial information between periods by presenting the information as if the transactions had occurred at the beginning of the prior year. The pro forma information is adjusted for only the timing of the transactions and does not reflect the actions undertaken by management in integrating the applicable businesses or the financial or operational benefits that have been or may be realized as a result of the transactions.

Note 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Description of Business
Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner" or the "Company") is a leading media and entertainment company, whose businesses include interactive services, cable systems, filmed entertainment, television networks and publishing. Time Warner classifies its operations into five reportable segments: AOL: consisting principally of interactive consumer and advertising services; Cable: consisting principally of cable systems that provide video, high-speed data and voice services; Filmed Entertainment: consisting principally of feature film, television and home video production and distribution; Networks: consisting principally of cable television networks that provide programming; and Publishing: consisting principally of magazine publishing.
Changes in Basis of Presentation
The 2006 financial information has been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the 2007 financial information. Specifically, the Company has reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented the financial condition and results of operations of certain businesses sold during the year ended December 31, 2007, which included Tegic Communications, Inc., Wildseed LLC, the Parenting Group, most of the Time4 Media magazine titles, magazine, Leisure Arts, Inc. and the Atlanta Braves baseball franchise. In 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia") (the "Adelphia Acquisition"), the related exchange of certain cable systems that were with Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") (the "Exchange") and the redemption of Comcast's interests in Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC") (the "TWC Redemption") and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (collectively, the "Redemptions" and, together with the Adelphia Acquisition and the Exchange, the "Adelphia/Comcast Transactions"). Also included in discontinued operations for 2006 are the operations of the cable systems previously owned by TWC and transferred to Comcast in connection with the Redemptions and the Exchange (the "Transferred Systems"), including gains recognized on the transfers, the Turner South network and Time Warner Book Group. The financial data for the discontinued operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is as follows (millions, except per share amounts):

In addition, on January 1, 2007, the Company began consolidating the results of the Kansas City, south and west Texas and New Mexico cable systems (the "Kansas City Pool") it received upon the distribution of the assets of Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners, L.P. ("TKCCP") to TWC and Comcast.

Note 3: INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS
In the normal course of business, the Time Warner segments enter into transactions with one another. The most common types of intersegment transactions include:
These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at estimated fair value as if the transactions were with third parties and, therefore, impact segment performance. While intersegment transactions are treated like third-party transactions to determine segment performance, the revenues (and corresponding expenses or assets recognized by the segment that is counterparty to the transaction) are eliminated in consolidation and, therefore, do not impact consolidated results. Additionally, transactions between divisions within the same reporting segment (e.g., a transaction between HBO and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. within the Networks segment) are eliminated in arriving at segment performance and, therefore, do not impact segment results.
The results for the year ended December 31, 2006 also include shutdown costs of $114 million at The WB Network in connection with the agreement between Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation to form the new fully-distributed national broadcast network, The CW Television Network. Included in the shutdown costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 are charges related to terminating intercompany programming arrangements with other Time Warner divisions, of which $47 million has been eliminated in consolidation, resulting in a net pretax charge of $67 million.

Revenues recognized by Time Warner's segments on intersegment transactions are as follows (millions):
