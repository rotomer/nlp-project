On June 19, 2008, Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc.

The Debt Securities are guaranteed by Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. and TW NY Cable Holding Inc., each a subsidiary of TWC (collectively, the Guarantors). In connection with the offering, on June 16, 2008, TWC and the Guarantors entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with , as representatives of the underwriters listed in Schedule II thereto (collectively, the Underwriters). The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, covenants and indemnification provisions. The offering of the Debt Securities was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-151671) (the Registration Statement) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on June 16, 2008. The terms of the Debt Securities are described in TWCs Prospectus dated June 16, 2008, as supplemented by a final Prospectus Supplement dated June 16, 2008, as filed with the Commission on June 17, 2008.
Banc of America Securities LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC
The Debt Securities were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2007 (the Indenture), by and among TWC, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York, as trustee.  
The 2013 Notes will mature on July 1, 2013, the 2018 Notes will mature on July 1, 2018 and the 2038 Debentures will mature on July 1, 2038. Interest on the 2013 Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2038 Debentures will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2009. The Debt Securities are unsecured senior obligations of TWC and rank equally with its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The guarantees of the Debt Securities are unsecured senior obligations of the Guarantors and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantors.   The Debt Securities may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at TWCs option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Debt Securities being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the Debt Securities discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a government treasury rate plus 40 basis points for each of the 2013 Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2038 Debentures as further described in the Indenture and the Debt Securities, plus, in each case, accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date.   The Indenture contains customary covenants relating to restrictions on the ability of TWC or any material subsidiary to create liens and on the ability of TWC and the Guarantors to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets. The Indenture also contains customary events of default.  
Certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates have performed and may, from time to time in the future, engage in transactions with and perform commercial and investment banking and advisory services for the Company and its subsidiaries, including TWC, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
TWC intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the Debt Securities to fund, in part, its payment of a special cash dividend of approximately $10.9 billion to be distributed pro rata to all holders of TWC Class A Common Stock and TWC Class B Common Stock prior to the separation of TWC from the Company as described in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 20, 2008, which was filed with the Commission on May 27, 2008. If the separation is not consummated and the special divided is not paid, TWC will use the proceeds from the issuance of the Debt Securities for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness.
