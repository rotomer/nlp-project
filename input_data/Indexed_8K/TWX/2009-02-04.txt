Exhibit 99.1
Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today reported financial results for its full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008.
NEW YORK, February 4, 2009 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said: "We're making progress at Time Warner toward our goals of becoming a more content-focused company and delivering increasing returns to our stockholders. Last year, our priorities were to rationalize our structure and improve our operating performance. Despite the challenging economic environment, we achieved most of what we set out to do. Moving into 2009, we intend to build on these accomplishments."
Mr. Bewkes continued: "Operationally, we'll continue to improve the efficiency of our businesses while creating even more of the compelling content that's becoming increasingly valuable. Structurally, we'll complete the Time Warner Cable separation soon. At the same time, we'll strengthen our balance sheet, improve our strategic flexibility and return capital to our stockholders on a consistent basis. Through these steps, we expect to emerge from this downturn in an even stronger competitive position."
Full-Year Results
Revenues grew 1% over 2008 to $47.0 billion, reflecting increases at the Company's Cable and Networks segments.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization rose 1% to $13.0 billion. The growth at the Cable, Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments more than offset declines at the Publishing and AOL segments. The Company's Operating Loss of $16.0 billion reflected a decline of $24.9 billion compared to 2007's Operating Income of $8.9 billion, due mainly to a $24.2 billion noncash impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.
Cash Provided by Operations totaled $10.3 billion and Free Cash Flow amounted to $6.0 billion (reflecting a 46% conversion rate of Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization). As of December 31, 2008, Net Debt was $33.0 billion, down $2.6 billion from $35.6 billion at the end of 2007, due primarily to the generation of Free Cash Flow, offset in part by acquisitions.
Diluted Loss per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $3.74 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations of $1.08 in 2007. The current and prior year amounts included certain items affecting comparability that are described in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The net impact of such items was to decrease the current year results by $4.73 per diluted common share and to increase the prior year results by $0.12 per diluted common share.
 
Fourth-Quarter Results
Fourth-quarter revenues declined 3% over the same period in 2007 to $12.3 billion, driven mainly by decreases at the Filmed Entertainment, AOL and Publishing segments, offset partially by increases at the Cable and Networks segments.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization decreased 8% to $3.2 billion. Increases at the Cable, AOL and Filmed Entertainment segments were more than offset by declines at the Publishing and Networks segments, which were adversely affected by significant charges related to restructurings and a trial court judgment, respectively, as described in the Performance of Segments section below. The Company's Operating Loss of $22.2 billion represented a decline of $24.5 billion compared to the year-ago quarter's Operating Income of $2.3 billion, due largely to a $24.2 billion noncash impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.
Diluted Loss per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $4.47 for the three months ended December 31, 2008, compared to Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations of $0.28 in last year's fourth quarter. The current and prior year quarters' amounts included certain items affecting comparability that are described in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The net impact of such items was to decrease the current and prior year quarters' results by $4.70 and $0.01 per diluted common share, respectively.

Presented below is a discussion of Time Warner's segments for the 2008 full year and fourth quarter. Unless otherwise noted, the dollar amounts in parentheses represent year-over-year changes.
AOL
Full-Year Results
declined 20% ($1.0 billion) to $4.2 billion, due mainly to decreases of 31% ($859 million) in Subscription revenues and 6% ($135 million) in Advertising revenues. The decline in Subscription revenues resulted from a decrease in subscribers, which reflects primarily AOL's strategy to offer its e-mail and certain other products free of charge to Internet consumers. Reducing Advertising revenues were declines in display advertising on AOL Network sites and sales of advertising on third-party Internet sites, offset partially by an increase in paid-search advertising.
Revenues
decreased 15% ($278 million) to $1.6 billion, reflecting primarily lower revenues and higher traffic acquisition costs ($83 million), offset partly by lower personnel and overhead costs, as well as reduced marketing, network and other expenses. The current and prior year results also included net restructuring charges of $17 million and $125 million, respectively.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
of $1.1 billion reflected a decline of $3.1 billion compared to the prior year Operating Income of $2.0 billion, due mainly to a $2.2 billion noncash impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, a $22 million noncash impairment related to asset writedowns in connection with facility consolidations and the absence of the net pretax gain of $668 million on the prior year sale of AOL's German access business. Also contributing to the decline were lower Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization and higher amortization expense ($70 million), offset in part by lower depreciation expense ($98 million).
Operating Loss
Fourth-Quarter Results
decreased 23% ($283 million) to $968 million, including declines of 27% ($160 million) in Subscription revenues and 18% ($113 million) in Advertising revenues. increased 6% ($24 million) to $405 million. The current and prior year quarters reflected restructuring charges of $2 million and $98 million, respectively. of $1.9 billion represented a decline of $2.2 billion compared to the year-ago quarter's Operating Income of $274 million, resulting from a $2.2 billion noncash impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and a $13 million noncash impairment related to asset writedowns in connection with facility consolidations.

During the quarter, AOL had 109 million average monthly domestic unique visitors and 54 billion domestic page views, according to comScore Media Metrix, which translates into 165 average monthly domestic page views per unique visitor.
As of December 31, 2008, the AOL service had 6.9 million U.S. access subscribers, a decline of 573,000 from the prior quarter and 2.4 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting subscriber losses due partially to AOL's strategy to prioritize its advertising business.

CABLE
(Time Warner Cable)
Full-Year Results
increased 8% ($1.2 billion) to $17.2 billion. Subscription revenues rose 8% ($1.2 billion) to $16.3 billion. Video revenues grew 4% ($359 million) to $10.5 billion, benefiting from the continued growth in digital video subscriptions and video price increases. High-speed data revenues climbed 12% ($429 million) to $4.2 billion, driven by continued high-speed data subscriber growth. Voice revenues increased 36% ($426 million) to $1.6 billion. Advertising revenues grew 4% ($31 million) to $898 million, due mainly to an increase in political advertising revenues, offset partially by declines in other categories.
Revenues
rose 8% ($444 million) to $6.2 billion, benefiting from revenue growth, offset partly by higher employee, video programming and voice costs related primarily to increases in digital video, high-speed data and Digital Phone subscribers, as well as higher marketing costs resulting from intensified marketing efforts. Additionally, the current year results included restructuring expenses of $15 million, compared to merger-related and restructuring expenses of $23 million in the prior year.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
of $11.8 billion reflected a decline of $14.6 billion compared to the prior year Operating Income of $2.8 billion, due to a $14.8 billion noncash impairment of cable franchise rights, a $45 million noncash impairment of certain non-core cable systems and a $13 million loss on the sale of these non-core cable systems. Also contributing to the decline was an increase in depreciation expense ($122 million), offset in part by higher Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization.
Operating Loss
Fourth-Quarter Results
rose 8% ($313 million) to $4.4 billion. grew 6% ($97 million) to $1.7 billion. of $13.9 billion represented a decline of $14.7 billion compared to the year-ago quarter's Operating Income of $795 million, resulting from a $14.8 billion noncash impairment of cable franchise rights and a $13 million loss on the sale of certain non-core cable systems, offset in part by higher Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization.

The current year included revenues from , and while revenues in the prior year included , , and . Also contributing to the decline were lower television license fees, due mainly to the prior year's initial off-network availabilities of and and the negative impact of the Writers Guild of America (East and West) strike on the current year results. These decreases were offset partially by growth in interactive video games revenues, due primarily to the releases of and .

NETWORKS
(Turner Broadcasting & HBO)
Full-Year Results
rose 9% ($884 million) to $11.2 billion, benefiting from growth of 9% ($577 million) in Subscription revenues and 10% ($301 million) in Advertising revenues. The increase in Subscription revenues resulted mainly from higher rates at both Turner and HBO and, to a lesser extent, more subscribers for Turner's networks, as well as the impact of international expansion. Advertising revenues benefited from increases at Turner's domestic entertainment and news networks, reflecting largely higher CPMs (advertising rates per thousand viewers) and audience delivery, as well as increases at Turner's international networks, due primarily to an increase in the number of units sold.
Revenues
climbed 4% ($138 million) to $3.5 billion, reflecting revenue growth, offset primarily by higher programming and election-related newsgathering expenses. The current year results also included a charge of approximately $280 million, taken in connection with a trial court judgment against Turner related to the 2004 sale of its winter sports teams. This charge reduced growth in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization by 8 percentage points. Programming expenses grew 8% to $3.9 billion, driven largely by an increase in programming costs associated with international expansion; sports programming costs at Turner, related particularly to NBA programming; and higher original and licensed programming costs. In addition, programming expenses in the current and prior year results included impairments of $38 million and $6 million, respectively, in connection with the decision not to proceed with certain original programming. The prior year results included a charge of $37 million related to restructuring charges and severance at HBO.
Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization
grew 3% ($103 million) to $3.1 billion, due mainly to the increase in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization, offset partly by increased depreciation ($23 million) and amortization ($25 million) expenses. The current year results included an $18 million noncash impairment of GameTap, an online video game business and a $3 million loss on the sale of GameTap. The prior year results included a $34 million noncash impairment of the Court TV tradename due to rebranding the network's name to truTV.
Operating Income
Fourth-Quarter Results
rose 9% ($234 million) to $2.9 billion, including increases of 7% ($113 million) in Subscription revenues and 7% ($65 million) in Advertising revenues. declined 20% ($175 million) to $682 million. The current year quarter's results included a charge of approximately $270 million taken in connection with a trial court judgment against Turner related to the 2004 sale of its winter sports teams. This charge reduced growth in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization by 31 percentage points. decreased 24% ($184 million) to $586 million, reflecting primarily the decline in Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization

CONSOLIDATED REPORTED NET INCOME (LOSS) AND PER SHARE RESULTS
Full-Year Results
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported a Net Loss of $13.4 billion, or $3.74 per diluted common share. This compares to 2007 Net Income of $4.4 billion, or $1.17 per diluted common share.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported a Loss from Continuing Operations of $13.4 billion, or $3.74 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations in 2007 of $4.1 billion, or $1.08 per diluted common share.

The comparability of the Company's results from continuing operations has been affected by certain significant transactions and other items in the current and prior years. Refer to Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements at the end of this release for a discussion of these items.
In the aggregate, these items affecting comparability had the net effect of decreasing the current year Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations by $17.0 billion (net of taxes), or $4.73 per diluted common share, and increasing the prior year by $426 million (net of taxes), or $0.12 per diluted common share. Excluding such items, Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations decreased, reflecting higher amortization and depreciation expenses and the impact of an increase in the effective tax rate due to the potential nondeductibility of certain litigation accruals, offset in part by growth in Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and lower interest expense. Excluding such items, Diluted Income (Loss) per Common Share from Continuing Operations increased in 2008 compared to 2007, driven by a decrease in average diluted common shares outstanding as a result of common stock repurchases made under the stock repurchase program, offset partly by the decline in Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations.
Fourth-Quarter Results
For the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported a Net Loss of $16.0 billion, or $4.47 per diluted common share. This compares to Net Income in the 2007 comparable quarter of $1.0 billion, or $0.28 per diluted common share.

The comparability of the Company's results from continuing operations has been affected by certain significant transactions and other items in the current and prior year quarters. Refer to Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements at the end of this release for a discussion of these items.
In the aggregate, these items affecting comparability had the net effect of decreasing the current year quarter's Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations by $16.8 billion (net of taxes), or $4.70 per diluted common share, and decreasing the prior year quarter's Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations by $35 million (net of taxes), or $0.01 per diluted common share. Excluding such items, Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations decreased, reflecting lower Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization and the impact of an increase in the effective tax rate due to the potential nondeductibility of certain litigation accruals, offset in part by lower interest expense. Excluding such items, Diluted Income (Loss) per Common Share from Continuing Operations declined in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter, driven by lower Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations, offset partly by a decrease in average diluted common shares outstanding as a result of common stock repurchases made under the stock repurchase program.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM UPDATE
From the announcement of the Company's $5 billion stock repurchase program on August 1, 2007, through February 3, 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 154 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.8 billion.

Use of Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow
The Company utilizes Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. The Company also evaluates the performance of its businesses using Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets, as well as gains and losses on asset sales, and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations (referred to herein as Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization). Both Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company's businesses. Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of noncash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were primarily recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's businesses. Moreover, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization does not reflect gains and losses on asset sales or amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations or any impairment charge related to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. Management evaluates the investments in such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budgets, investment spending levels and return on capital.
Free Cash Flow is Cash Provided by Operations (as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries) and excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, less cash flow attributable to discontinued operations, capital expenditures and product development costs, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its businesses and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends to common shareholders and repurchase stock. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect payments made in connection with the securities litigation and government investigations, which reduce liquidity.
Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's Operating Income, Net Income and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Note 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Description of Business
Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner" or the "Company") is a leading media and entertainment company, whose businesses include interactive services, cable systems, filmed entertainment, television networks and publishing. Time Warner classifies its operations into five reportable segments: AOL: consisting principally of interactive consumer and advertising services; Cable: consisting principally of cable systems that provide video, high-speed data and voice services; Filmed Entertainment: consisting principally of feature film, television and home video production and distribution; Networks: consisting principally of cable television networks that provide programming; and Publishing: consisting principally of magazine publishing.
Note 2: INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS
In the normal course of business, the Time Warner segments enter into transactions with one another. The most common types of intersegment transactions include:
These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at estimated fair value as if the transactions were with third parties and, therefore, impact segment performance. While intersegment transactions are treated like third-party transactions to determine segment performance, the revenues (and corresponding expenses or assets recognized by the segment that is counterparty to the transaction) are eliminated in consolidation and, therefore, do not impact consolidated results.
Additionally, transactions between divisions within the same reporting segment (e.g., a transaction between HBO and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. within the Networks segment) are eliminated in arriving at segment performance and, therefore, do not impact segment results.
Revenues recognized by Time Warner's segments on intersegment transactions are as follows (millions):
