Item 1.01.   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously reported, on May 20, 2008, Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner"), Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P., TW NY Cable Holding Inc., Warner Communications Inc., Historic TW Inc. ("Historic TW") and American Television and Communications Corporation entered into a separation agreement (the "Separation Agreement") for the purpose of achieving the legal and structural separation of TWC from Time Warner (the "Separation"). The Separation Agreement and related documents contemplate, as a condition to the Separation, that Time Warner will complete certain internal restructuring transactions, including the merger (the "Merger") of Time Warner Companies, Inc., a subsidiary of Time Warner ("TWCI"), with and into Historic TW, a subsidiary of Time Warner, with Historic TW being the surviving corporation.
In connection with the Merger, on February 23, 2009, Time Warner, Historic TW, TWCI, AOL LLC, a subsidiary of Time Warner ("AOL"), and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., a subsidiary of Time Warner ("TBS"), executed and delivered three supplemental indentures to three indentures under which TWCI is the issuer of debt securities or a guarantor of debt securities. As described further below, each of the three supplemental indentures provides for the assumption by Historic TW of TWCI's obligations under the applicable indenture and related debt securities and affirms the obligations of Time Warner and AOL as guarantors under the indentures and related debt securities. Because each of Historic TW, Time Warner and AOL is currently a direct or indirect guarantor under the indentures and related debt securities, none of these entities became obligated on any new financial obligation as a result of the supplemental indentures. Each of the supplemental indentures described below became effective on February 24, 2009, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time").
1992 TWCI Fifth Supplemental Indenture
On February 23, 2009, TWCI, Time Warner, AOL, Historic TW, TBS and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, entered into the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the "1992 TWCI Fifth Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture, dated as of October 15, 1992, among the same foregoing parties (as amended and supplemented, the "1992 TWCI Indenture"). The 1992 TWCI Indenture relates to debt securities issued by TWCI, of which a total of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of debt securities are currently outstanding (the "1992 TWCI Securities").
Historic TW is currently a guarantor of the obligations of TWCI, as the issuer, and the obligations of TBS, as a guarantor, under the 1992 TWCI Indenture, and AOL is a guarantor of all of Historic TW's obligations under Historic TW's guarantees under the 1992 TWCI Indenture. Time Warner is a guarantor of all of Historic TW's obligations under Historic TW's guarantees under the 1992 TWCI Indenture, as well as a guarantor of AOL's obligations under AOL's guarantee under the 1992 TWCI Indenture. Under the 1992 TWCI Fifth Supplemental Indenture, at the Effective Time, (i) Historic TW assumed the obligations of TWCI as the issuer of the 1992 TWCI Securities, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the 1992 TWCI Securities and the performance of every covenant under the 1992 TWCI Indenture to be performed or observed by the issuer, and (ii) each of Time Warner and AOL affirmed its respective guarantee of Historic TW's obligations, as successor to TWCI, under the 1992 TWCI Indenture and the 1992 TWCI Securities.
1993 TWCI Eighth Supplemental Indenture
On February 23, 2009, TWCI, Time Warner, AOL, Historic TW, TBS and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, entered into the Eighth Supplemental Indenture (the "1993 TWCI Eighth Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture, dated as of January 15, 1993, among the same foregoing parties (as amended and supplemented, the "1993 TWCI Indenture"). The 1993 TWCI Indenture relates to debt securities issued by TWCI, of which $2.43 billion aggregate principal amount of debt securities are currently outstanding (the "1993 TWCI Securities").
Historic TW is currently a guarantor of the obligations of TWCI, as the issuer, and the obligations of TBS, as a guarantor, under the 1993 TWCI Indenture, and AOL is a guarantor of all of Historic TW's obligations under Historic TW's guarantees under the 1993 TWCI Indenture. Time Warner is a guarantor of all of Historic TW's obligations under Historic TW's guarantees under the 1993 TWCI Indenture, as well as a guarantor of AOL's obligations under AOL's guarantee under the 1993 TWCI Indenture. Under the 1993 Eighth Supplemental Indenture, at the Effective Time, (i) Historic TW assumed the obligations of TWCI as the issuer of the 1993 TWCI Securities, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the 1993 TWCI Securities and the performance of every covenant under the 1993 TWCI Indenture to be performed or observed by the issuer, and (ii) each of Time Warner and AOL affirmed their respective guarantee of Historic TW's obligations, as successor to TWCI, under the 1993 TWCI Indenture and the 1993 TWCI Securities.
 
1993 TBS Fifth Supplemental Indenture
On February 23, 2009, TBS, TWCI, Time Warner, AOL, Historic TW and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, entered into the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the "1993 TBS Fifth Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture, dated as of May 15, 1993, among the same foregoing parties (as amended and supplemented, the "1993 TBS Indenture"). The 1993 TBS Indenture relates to debt securities issued by TBS, of which $300 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities are currently outstanding (the "1993 TBS Securities").
Each of Historic TW and TWCI is currently a guarantor of the obligations of TBS as the issuer under the 1993 TBS Indenture. Under the 1993 TBS Fifth Supplemental Indenture, at the Effective Time, Historic TW assumed the obligations of TWCI as a guarantor under the 1993 TBS Indenture, including (i) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the 1993 TBS Securities when due and all other monetary obligations of TWCI under the 1993 TBS Indenture and the 1993 TBS Securities and (ii) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of TWCI under the 1993 TBS Indenture and the 1993 TBS Securities.
A copy of each of the 1992 TWCI Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the 1993 TWCI Eighth Supplemental Indenture and the 1993 TBS Fifth Supplemental Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On February 26, 2009, Time Warner issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has (i) approved the distribution of all the shares of TWC common stock that it then holds to its stockholders of record as of 8:00 p.m. on March 12, 2009 (the "Distribution Record Date") (the "Eligible Holders") as a pro rata dividend (the "Distribution") and (ii) approved a reverse stock split of the outstanding and treasury common stock of Time Warner at a stock split ratio of 1-for-3 (the "Reverse Stock Split").
A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.4.
Separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. from Time Warner Inc.
As previously reported in May 2008, the Distribution will be made pursuant to the terms of a separation agreement dated as of May 20, 2008, among Time Warner, TWC, Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P., TW NY Cable Holding Inc., Warner Communications Inc., Historic TW Inc. and American Television and Communications Corporation (the "Separation Agreement") for the purpose of achieving the legal and structural separation of TWC from Time Warner (the "Separation"). In connection with and as a condition to the Separation, on March 12, 2009, TWC will pay a special cash dividend of $10.27 per share of TWC Class A Common Stock and TWC Class B Common Stock (approximately $10.9 billion) (the "Special Dividend") to be distributed pro rata to all holders of TWC Class A Common Stock and TWC Class B Common Stock on the record date of March 11, 2009, resulting in the receipt by Time Warner of approximately $9.25 billion. On March 12, 2009, after the receipt by Time Warner of its pro rata share of the Special Dividend, TWC will file its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which, among other things, each outstanding share of TWC Class A Common Stock and TWC Class B Common Stock will be converted into one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share. In addition, as TWC announced on February 26, 2009, shortly after filing its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, but prior to the Distribution Record Date, TWC intends to file an amendment to its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation on March 12, 2009 to effect a 1-for-3 reverse split of the outstanding and treasury TWC common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, concurrently with the receipt of its pro rata share of the Special Dividend on March 12, 2009, Time Warner will deposit the shares of TWC common stock that it then holds with Computershare Inc. ("Computershare") to be held (i) for the benefit of Time Warner until the Distribution Record Date and (ii) thereafter, for the benefit of the Eligible Holders until March 27, 2009, at which time the shares of TWC common stock will be distributed to the Eligible Holders. Fractional shares of TWC common stock will not be distributed to Time Warner stockholders. Instead, the fractional shares of TWC common stock will be aggregated and sold in the open market, with the net proceeds distributed pro rata in the form of cash payments to Time Warner stockholders who would otherwise hold TWC fractional shares. Following the Distribution Record Date, Time Warner will no longer beneficially own any shares of TWC common stock, and will not consolidate TWC's financial results for the purpose of its own financial reporting.
 
Time Warner Reverse Stock Split
The Reverse Stock Split will become effective at 7:00 p.m. on March 27, 2009. On January 16, 2009, Time Warner's stockholders voted to authorize the Board to effect, in its discretion, a reverse stock split of the outstanding and treasury common stock of Time Warner, at a reverse stock split ratio of either 1-for-2 or 1-for-3, as determined by the Board. Under the terms of the Reverse Stock Split, Time Warner stockholders will not be entitled to receive fractional shares, but instead stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share will be paid in cash an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of the share multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of a share of Time Warner common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on March 27, 2009 (adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split ratio).

Exhibit 99.4
For Immediate Release:
Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today announced that it will complete the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off involving a dividend distribution of all of the Time Warner Cable common stock held by Time Warner to Time Warner stockholders. The distribution will be made on March 27, 2009 to Time Warner stockholders of record at 8 p.m. on March 12, 2009.
NEW YORK, February 26, 2009 
Time Warner Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said:  "We're confident that this separation will benefit Time Warner and Time Warner Cable stockholders. Both companies will be better positioned to compete, with capital structures more suited to their respective needs as well as greater operational, financial and strategic flexibility. At the remaining Time Warner businesses, we'll stay focused on what we do best  creating, packaging and distributing our branded, high-quality content."
This separation is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions listed in a separation agreement entered into on May 20, 2008, by and among Time Warner, Time Warner Cable and certain of their subsidiaries. If the conditions are met in accordance with the timing currently contemplated, the separation will be effective at the record date for the distribution, and book-entry account statements reflecting the Time Warner Cable shares will be distributed to the eligible Time Warner stockholders on or about March 27, 2009.
In connection with the distribution of its Time Warner Cable shares, Time Warner also announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a one-for-three reverse stock split of the Time Warner common stock, which will become effective at 7 p.m. on March 27, 2009.
Please see for additional information, including Frequently Asked Questions, regarding the spin-off of Time Warner Cable and the reverse stock split of Time Warner common stock described in this release.

Spin-Off Dividend of Time Warner Cable Shares to Time Warner Stockholders
Time Warner stockholders will receive a pro rata portion of all of the Time Warner Cable common stock held by Time Warner for each share of Time Warner common stock they hold on the record date of 8 p.m. on March 12, 2009. As of February 13, 2009, there were 3,587,795,646 shares of Time Warner common stock issued and outstanding, and as of today, Time Warner holds a total of 901 million shares of Time Warner Cable common stock, or approximately 0.251129 Time Warner Cable shares per Time Warner share. Earlier today, Time Warner Cable announced that it expects to effect a one-for-three reverse stock split of its common stock on March 12, 2009. As stated above, Time Warner also expects to effect a one-for-three reverse stock split of its common stock, which will become effective at 7 p.m. on March 27, 2009, after the distribution of its Time Warner Cable common stock is complete. Consequently, the distribution ratio for the pro rata distribution of Time Warner Cable common stock will reflect the reverse stock split of the Time Warner Cable common stock, but not the reverse stock split of the Time Warner common stock. Based on this information, Time Warner expects to distribute approximately 0.083710 share of Time Warner Cable common stock for each share of Time Warner common stock that Time Warner stockholders hold on the record date. The Company will announce the final distribution ratio after the March 12 record date when the number of outstanding shares of Time Warner common stock has been determined.
One of the conditions to the distribution is the payment by Time Warner Cable of a special cash dividend of approximately $10.9 billion to be distributed pro rata to holders of Time Warner Cable common stock, including about $9.25 billion to Time Warner. Earlier today, Time Warner Cable announced that its Board of Directors has declared a special dividend of $10.27 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $10.9 billion, to holders of Time Warner Cable common stock as of the close of business on March 11, 2009, with a payment date of March 12, 2009.
 
No action is required by Time Warner stockholders to receive the shares of Time Warner Cable common stock. Stockholders who hold Time Warner common stock at the record date will receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of Time Warner Cable common stock or their brokerage account will be credited with the Time Warner Cable shares.
Fractional shares of Time Warner Cable common stock will not be distributed to Time Warner stockholders. Instead, the fractional shares of Time Warner Cable common stock will be aggregated and sold in the open market, with the net proceeds distributed pro rata in the form of cash payments to Time Warner stockholders who would otherwise hold Time Warner Cable fractional shares.
Time Warner has received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and an opinion of counsel that the distribution of Time Warner Cable common stock to Time Warner stockholders qualifies as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares.  Non-U.S. stockholders may be subject to tax on the distribution in jurisdictions other than the U.S.  Time Warner stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the particular consequences of the distribution in their situation, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws.
One-for-Three Reverse Stock Split
At 7 p.m. on March 27, 2009, the effective time of the reverse stock split, each three shares of Time Warner common stock outstanding will automatically convert into one share of Time Warner common stock. Time Warner's stockholders authorized the Board to implement the reverse stock split at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on January 16, 2009.
No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Time Warner reverse stock split. Instead, any Time Warner stockholder who would otherwise hold a fractional share of Time Warner common stock as a result of the reverse stock split will receive a cash payment in lieu of any such fractional share equal to (i) the fractional share interest to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of the Time Warner common stock on the effective day of the reverse stock split as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape (on a post-reverse stock split basis, as adjusted).
A letter of transmittal relating to the reverse stock split will be mailed to holders of physical certificates representing Time Warner common stock once the reverse stock split is effective. All Time Warner stockholders will ultimately receive their replacement shares of Time Warner common stock in book-entry form along with a cash payment for any fractional share.
As stated above, as of February 13, 2009, there were 3,587,795,646 shares of Time Warner common stock issued and outstanding. After giving effect to the reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-three, there will be approximately 1.2 billion shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
Trading of Time Warner Common Stock
Shares of Time Warner common stock will continue to trade "regular way" on the New York Stock Exchange through the period leading up to and including the distribution date of March 27, 2009. Any holders of shares of Time Warner common stock who sell Time Warner shares "regular way" on or before March 27, 2009 will also be selling their right to receive shares of Time Warner Cable common stock. Investors are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors regarding the specific implications of buying or selling Time Warner common stock on or before the distribution date.
 
The CUSIP number for the new Time Warner Common stock that will be outstanding after the reverse stock split has become effective at 7 p.m. on March 27, 2009 will be 887317 303.
