Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. As previously reported, on December 10, 2008, Time Warner Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "Time Warner") (as lender and administrative agent), and Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC") (as borrower) entered into a $1.535 billion credit agreement (the "Supplemental Credit Agreement") for a two-year senior unsecured supplemental term loan facility (the "Supplemental Credit Facility"). TWC was permitted to borrow under the Supplemental Credit Facility only to repay amounts outstanding at the final maturity of its unsecured term loan credit facility entered into on June 30, 2008 (the "TWC Bridge Facility"). TWC entered into the TWC Bridge Facility to fund in part the special cash dividend (the "Special Dividend") that TWC paid to its stockholders in connection with the separation of TWC from the Company. As previously reported, on March 12, 2009, TWC borrowed the full committed amount of $1.932 billion under the TWC Bridge Facility, all of which was used to pay a portion of the Special Dividend. Prior to the legal and structural separation of TWC from the Company on March 12, 2009, Time Warner owned approximately 85.2% of TWC's common stock. As TWC reported on March 26, 2009, TWC completed an offering of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities on March 26, 2009 and used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to prepay in full the outstanding loans and all other amounts due under the TWC Bridge Facility, and the TWC Bridge Facility was terminated in accordance with its terms. Concurrently with the termination of the TWC Bridge Facility and pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Credit Agreement, on March 26, 2009, TWC terminated the commitments of Time Warner under the Supplemental Credit Facility and the Supplemental Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.
