Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change In Fiscal Year. On March 27, 2009, Time Warner Inc. (the "Company") filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, which became effective at 7:00 p.m., Eastern time. The Certificate of Amendment effected the previously approved reverse stock split of the Company's outstanding and treasury common stock at a ratio of one-for-three (the "Reverse Stock Split"). The reverse stock split was implemented in connection with the spin-off of Time Warner Cable Inc. from the Company. As a result of the amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's authorized share capital was reduced to 9.68 billion shares, consisting of (1) 750 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share, (2) 8.33 billion shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and (3) 600 million shares of series common stock, par value $0.01 per share. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock was reduced to approximately 1.2 billion. The new CUSIP number for the Company's common stock is 887317 303. A copy of the Certificate of Amendment as filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference. On March 27, 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing the completion of the Reverse Stock Split. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. Item 8.01 Other Events. The Company currently has 19 registration statements on Form S-8 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") that register shares offered pursuant to awards under incentive compensation and savings plans. SEC regulations permit the Company to incorporate by reference future filings made with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prior to the termination of the offerings covered by registration statements filed on Form S-8. The information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of the prospectus included within each of those registration statements. Information in this report is therefore intended to be automatically incorporated by reference into each of the active registration statements on Form S-8 listed below, thereby amending them. Pursuant to Rule 416(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the amount of undistributed shares of common stock deemed to be covered by each of the following effective registration statements of the Company will be proportionately reduced to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split: 1. Registration Statement No. 333-142536 on Form S-8 2. Registration Statement No. 333-137292 on Form S-8 3. Registration Statement No. 333 137291 on Form S-8 4.

Exhibit 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED][GRAPHIC OMITTED] [GRAPHIC OMITTED][GRAPHIC OMITTED] For Immediate Release: Time Warner Inc. Distributes Time Warner Cable Shares to Its Stockholders of Record and Effects One-for-Three Reverse Stock Split NEW YORK, March 27, 2009 - Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today announced that, in connection to the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off that became effective on March 12, 2009, it has begun to distribute Time Warner Cable shares to Time Warner stockholders. The company also announced that it implemented a one-for-three reverse stock split of the Time Warner common stock at 7 p.m. today. Time Warner common stock will begin to trade, reflecting the reverse split and the distribution of the Time Warner Cable shares, on Monday, March 30, 2009. Time Warner Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said: "We're excited about Time Warner's future as one of the leading pure content companies in the world. We remain focused on using our industry-leading scale and brands to create, package and distribute high-quality content on multiple platforms globally. The current economic environment is challenging, but we're going to continue to run our businesses as efficiently as possible, while investing even more in the top-notch content that defines our brands. I'm confident that we'll emerge from this downturn in an even stronger position to generate consistent, attractive financial results and improve returns to our shareholders." Spin-Off Dividend of Time Warner Cable Shares to Time Warner Stockholders Beginning today, 0.083670 share of Time Warner Cable common stock is being distributed for each share of Time Warner common stock held at the record date of 8 p.m. on March 12, 2009. No action is required by Time Warner stockholders to receive the shares of Time Warner Cable common stock. Stockholders who held Time Warner common stock at the record date will receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of Time Warner Cable common stock or their brokerage account will be credited with the Time Warner Cable shares. Fractional shares of Time Warner Cable common stock will not be distributed to Time Warner stockholders. Instead, the fractional shares of Time Warner Cable common stock will be aggregated and sold in the open market, with the net proceeds to be distributed pro rata in the form of cash payments to Time Warner stockholders who would otherwise hold Time Warner Cable fractional shares. Time Warner has received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and an opinion of counsel that the distribution of Time Warner Cable common stock to Time Warner stockholders should qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares. Non-U.S. stockholders may be subject to tax on the distribution in jurisdictions other than the U.S. Time Warner stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the particular consequences of the distribution in their situation, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws.
One-for-Three Reverse Stock Split At 7 p.m. today, the effective time of the reverse stock split, each three shares of Time Warner common stock outstanding automatically converted into one share of Time Warner common stock. Time Warner's stockholders authorized the Board to implement the reverse stock split at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on January 16, 2009. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Time Warner reverse stock split. Instead, any Time Warner stockholder who would otherwise hold a fractional share of Time Warner common stock as a result of the reverse stock split will receive a cash payment in lieu of any such fractional share equal to (i) the fractional share interest to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of the Time Warner common stock today as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape (on a post-reverse stock split basis, as adjusted). A letter of transmittal relating to the reverse stock split will be mailed to holders of certificates representing Time Warner common stock. All Time Warner stockholders will ultimately receive their replacement shares of Time Warner common stock in book-entry form along with a cash payment for any fractional share. As of March 12, 2009, there were 3,589,474,552 shares of Time Warner common stock issued and outstanding. After giving effect to the reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-three, there are approximately 1.2 billion shares of Time Warner common stock issued and outstanding. The CUSIP number for the new Time Warner common stock outstanding after the reverse stock split is 887317 303.
