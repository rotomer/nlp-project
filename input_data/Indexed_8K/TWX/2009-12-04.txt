Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
As previously reported, on November 16, 2009, Time Warner Inc., a Delaware corporation (Time Warner), entered into a separation and distribution agreement (the Separation Agreement) with AOL Inc., a Delaware corporation (AOL), pursuant to which AOL will be legally and structurally separated from Time Warner (the Separation).  Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Time Warner and AOL agreed, among other things, to complete certain internal restructuring transactions and cause substantially all of the assets and liabilities of AOL LLC (other than certain non-material assets and liabilities and AOL LLCs guarantees of indebtedness of Time Warner and other non-AOL affiliates of Time Warner) to be transferred to and assumed by AOL (the Asset Distribution).
 
On December 4, 2009, Time Warner, AOL and AOL LLC completed the Asset Distribution.  Following the Asset Distribution, AOL LLC was renamed Historic AOL LLC and AOL transferred its ownership of AOL LLC to Time Warner, which it will retain following the Separation.
 
The Indentures (as defined below) provide that if AOL LLC conveys or transfers its properties and assets substantially as an entirety and the transferee does not assume the relevant guarantee, Time Warner shall cause its wholly-owned subsidiary, Home Box Office, Inc., a Delaware corporation (HBO), to issue an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of the full and punctual payment of all the monetary obligations and the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations (including obligations to the Trustee (as defined below)) of Historic TW Inc. (including in its capacity as successor to Time Warner Companies, Inc. (TWCI)), a Delaware corporation (HTW), under the Indentures prior to or concurrently with such conveyance or transfer by AOL LLC (the HBO Guarantee).
 
Accordingly, in connection with the Asset Distribution, on December 3, 2009, Time Warner, HTW, AOL LLC, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., a Georgia corporation (TBS), HBO and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, executed and delivered each of the following five supplemental indentures (the Supplemental Indentures) pursuant to which HBO issued the HBO Guarantee of HTWs obligations under each such Indenture:
 
Each of the Supplemental Indentures became effective on December 3, 2009.  Copies of the Supplemental Indentures are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4 and 99.5.
In addition, as contemplated by the Separation Agreement, on December 4, 2009, TW AOL Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Time Warner that was formerly known as TW AOL Holdings Inc., distributed all of the shares of common stock of AOL Inc. it held to Time Warner.  In connection with this distribution, on December 4, 2009, Time Warner assumed the obligations of TW AOL Holdings LLC as a guarantor under the Indenture dated as of November 13, 2006 among Time Warner as issuer, and TW AOL Holdings LLC, HTW (including in its capacity as successor to TWCI) and TBS as guarantors, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the 2006 Indenture), by operation of Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of such indenture, and TW AOL Holdings LLC is no longer a guarantor under the 2006 Indenture.
