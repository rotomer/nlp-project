Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 19, 2011, Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner" or the "Company") entered into two new senior unsecured credit facilities consisting of a $2.5 billion three-year revolving credit facility (the "Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility") and a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the "Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Three-Year Credit Facility, the "Revolving Credit Facilities") pursuant to a Credit Agreement, dated as of January 19, 2011 (the "New Credit Agreement"), among Time Warner and Time Warner International Finance Limited ("TWIFL"), as borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent.
Concurrently with the effectiveness of the New Credit Agreement, Time Warner and TWIFL terminated their existing $5.0 billion senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on February 17, 2011 (the "Prior Credit Agreement"). As of January 19, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement.
The Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of January 19, 2014, and the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of January 19, 2016. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities may be made in U.S. dollars, British pounds, Euros or Japanese yen. Borrowings under each of the Revolving Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate based on the debt rating for Time Warner's senior unsecured long-term debt and the percentage of commitments used under the facility. Based on the debt rating as of January 19, 2011, borrowings under each of the Revolving Credit Facilities would bear interest at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR (TIBOR in the case of yen borrowings) plus 1.25% per year if the percentage of commitments used under the facility does not exceed 25% or (ii) LIBOR (TIBOR in the case of yen borrowings) plus 1.50% per year if the percentage of commitments used under the facility exceeds 25%. The borrowers must also pay a facility fee for each facility based on the debt rating for Time Warner's senior unsecured long-term debt and the aggregate amount of the commitments under the facility. Based on the debt rating as of January 19, 2011, the facility fee is 0.225% per year on the aggregate amount of commitments under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility and 0.300% per year on the aggregate amount of commitments under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility contains letter of credit and swingline loan sub-facilities. The provisions of the New Credit Agreement, including representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, are substantially similar to the provisions of the Prior Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement does not contain any credit ratings-based defaults or covenants or any ongoing covenants or representations specifically relating to a material adverse change in Time Warner's financial condition or results of operations. Amounts may be borrowed under the New Credit Agreement on same-day notice. As with the Prior Credit Agreement, the New Credit Agreement contains a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant of 4.5 times the consolidated EBITDA of Time Warner. The obligations of each borrower under the New Credit Agreement are directly or indirectly guaranteed by Historic TW Inc., Home Box Office, Inc. and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. The obligations of TWIFL under the New Credit Agreement are also guaranteed by Time Warner. The borrowers may from time to time, so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, increase the commitments under either or both of the Revolving Credit Facilities by up to $500 million per facility by adding new commitments or increasing the commitments of willing lenders.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities will be used for Time Warner's working capital needs and other general corporate purposes, including the support of commercial paper borrowings.
The foregoing description of the Revolving Credit Facilities does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Some of the lenders under the New Credit Agreement and their affiliates have performed, and/or may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services in the ordinary course of business for Time Warner and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and/or will receive, customary fees and commissions.

Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Yen Loans of such Class in which Lenders of such Class will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender of such Class, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such Yen Loan or Loans of the applicable Class. Each Lender of the applicable Class hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Yen Fronting Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Yen Loan or Loans of such Class in Dollars. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Yen Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

From and after such purchase, (A) the outstanding Yen Loans of the applicable Class in which the Lenders of the applicable Class have purchased such participations shall be deemed to have been converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (with such conversion constituting, for purposes of Section 2.15, a prepayment of such Yen Loans before the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto) and (B) all amounts from time to time accruing, and all amounts from time to time payable, on account of such Loans (including, without limitation, any interest and other amounts which were accrued but unpaid on the date of such purchase) shall be payable in Dollars as if such Loan had originally been made in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender of either Class shall not have any obligation to acquire a participation in a Yen Loan of such Class pursuant to this paragraph if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time such Yen Loan was made and such Lender shall have notified the Yen Fronting Lenders of such Class in writing, at least one Business Day prior to the time such Yen Loan was made, that such Event of Default has occurred and that such Lender will not acquire participations in Yen Loans of such Class made while such Event of Default is continuing.

Any amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the applicable Borrower (or other party on behalf of the applicable Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by a Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Five-Year Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the applicable Swingline Lender, pro rata as their interests may appear.

Letters of Credit
General
          (b) . To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), a Borrower shall deliver by hand or facsimile (or transmit by other electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank (reasonably in advance of the requested date of such issuance,
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions
 
amendment, renewal or extension and no later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, one Business Day prior to such date) a notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if not the Issuing Bank) requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount and Currency of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit, as the case may be. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended on the requested date only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Sublimit, (ii) the sum of the total Five-Year Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the sum total of the Five-Year Commitments and (iii) the requirements of paragraph (c) of this Section shall be satisfied.
          (c) . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the Five-Year Maturity Date unless such Letter of Credit is cash collateralized in an amount equal to its face amount with the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of such Issuing Bank, prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Five-Year Maturity Date; that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (but no such renewal shall be effected if such renewal would cause the expiry of such Letter of Credit to extend beyond the Five-Year Maturity Date unless such Letter of Credit is so cash collateralized in an amount equal to its face amount prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Five-Year Maturity Date).
Expiration Date
provided
          (d) . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Five-Year Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Five-Year Lender, and each Five-Year Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Five-Year Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Five-Year Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Five-Year Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Five-Year Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Five-Year Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

If the Borrower elects, or is deemed, to finance amounts due under any Letter of Credit in such a manner, the Borrower's obligation to pay an amount equal to the LC Disbursement to the Issuing Bank shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Five-Year Base Rate Borrowing, and the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent, who shall notify each Five-Year Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement and corresponding Five-Year Base Rate Borrowing and such Lender's Five-Year Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Five-Year Lender shall pay to the Issuing Bank its Five-Year Applicable Percentage of such Five-Year Base Rate Borrowing, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Five-Year Lenders). Promptly following receipt of any payment from a Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, such payment shall be distributed to the Issuing Bank (and the participating Five-Year Lenders as their interests may appear) or, to the extent that Five-Year Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to fund any Five-Year Base Rate Loan made to reimburse the Issuing Bank, to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank (and the participating Five-Year Lenders as their interests may appear) pro rata as their interests may appear.
Reimbursement
provided
mutatis
mutandis
          (f) . The applicable Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower's obligations hereunder, the respective Issuing Bank's only obligation to the applicable Borrower in respect of any drawing made on any Letter of Credit being to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and appear to substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Neither the Administrative Agent, nor any of the Five-Year Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
Obligations Absolute
 
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to such Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by such Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with any of the foregoing circumstances. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
provided
          (g) . The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and/or the Five-Year Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
          (h) . If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Five-Year Base Rate Loans in the applicable Currency; that, if such LC Disbursement cannot be reimbursed with the proceeds of a Five-Year Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.05(e) and the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within three Business Days, then Section 2.12(g) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Five-Year Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest
provided
          (i) . Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Time Warner, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank or pursuant to Article VIII. Time Warner shall notify the Administrative Agent, who will notify the Five-Year Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the applicable Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and
Replacement of an Issuing Bank
 
obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
          (j) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above in this Section 2.05, including, without limitation, the procedural requirements of clause (b) hereof, each letter of credit listed on Schedule 2.05 which is outstanding on the Effective Date (including any extension thereof) shall constitute a "Letter of Credit" for all purposes of this Agreement and shall be deemed issued, including for purposes of this Section 2.05 and Section 2.11(b), on the Effective Date. Thereafter, each such Letter of Credit deemed issued pursuant to this Section 2.05(j) shall be governed by, and shall be subject to the provisions of, this Section 2.05, and Time Warner and the respective Issuing Banks with respect to such Letters of Credit deemed issued pursuant to this Section 2.05 agree that any reimbursement agreement, credit agreement or other document (excluding such Letter of Credit itself) previously governing such Letter of Credit shall be deemed terminated and replaced with the provisions of this Section 2.05 and the other applicable terms of this Agreement (it being understood that any fees or other amounts payable to such Issuing Bank accrued prior to the Effective Date in respect of any such Letter of Credit, shall be payable to such Issuing Bank in accordance with the provisions of such prior agreement).
Existing Letters of Credit
          SECTION 2.06. . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time, for the applicable Currency, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower specified on Schedule 2.03(B) or designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.
Funding of Borrowings
provided
          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent shall have the right to demand payment from the applicable Lender and/or the applicable Borrower and they each severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (A) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, the Alternate Base Rate, and (B) in the case of Borrowings denominated in any Optional Currency, the interest rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent as the rate applicable to overnight settlements between banks for the amount advanced by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender or (ii) in the case of the applicable Borrower, the interest rate that would otherwise apply to such Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such
 
Borrowing and such payment shall absolve any obligation of the applicable Borrower in respect of any demand made under this Section in respect of such Loan.
          SECTION 2.07. . (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Class and Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type (but of the same currency and Class) or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may be made and maintained only as Base Rate Loans.

          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election (as more specifically set forth in Schedule 2.03(A)). Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower.
          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be a Base Rate Borrowing or a Eurocurrency or a TIBOR Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. All Loans denominated in Yen in each case shall be TIBOR Loans.
 
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each participating Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
          (e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing, as the case may be, having a one-month Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency and TIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

provided
          (b) Time Warner shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments of either Class under paragraph (a) of this Section at least one Business Day prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by Time Warner pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments of either Class delivered by Time Warner may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the occurrence of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by Time Warner (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of either Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of either Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.
provided

Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt
          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and Class thereof, whether such Loan is a Revolving Loan or a Swingline Loan and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

provided
          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of either Class made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the applicable Borrower. Thereafter, the Loans of the applicable Class evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that a notice of prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the occurrence of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the applicable Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to (i) a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the participating Lenders of the contents thereof and (ii) a Swingline Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Swingline Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing hereunder shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the applicable Maturity Date (or such earlier date after the applicable Commitment Termination Date on which the Loans of the applicable Class are repaid in full), commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          SECTION 2.13. . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing of either Class:
Alternate Rate of Interest
     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the relevant Currency or the TIBO Rate; or
     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Lenders holding a majority of the Commitments (disregarding any Defaulting Lender's Commitment) of the applicable Class that for such Interest Period the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the relevant Currency or the TIBO Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrowers and Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrowers and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing or TIBOR Borrowing, as applicable, of such Class shall be ineffective and any such Borrowing referred to in such Interest Election Request shall, unless repaid by the applicable Borrower, be converted to (as of the last day of the then current Interest Period), or maintained as, a Base Rate Borrowing of such Class, as the case may be (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and (ii) if any Borrowing Request
 
requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or TIBOR Revolving Borrowing of such Class, such Borrowing shall, unless otherwise rescinded by the applicable Borrower, be made as a Base Rate Loan of such Class in the applicable Currency (to the extent, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable determination, it is practicable to do so), and if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect fewer than all Types of Borrowings, then the other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted.
          SECTION 2.14. . (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
     (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market or the Tokyo interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
(in each case other than Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes and Taxes on gross or net income, profits or revenue (including value-added or similar Taxes)) and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs actually incurred or reduction actually suffered.
          (b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of the Commitment or the Loans made by, or participation in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction actually suffered in respect of the Commitment or Loans made by, or participation in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender hereunder.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be
 
delivered to the applicable Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or an Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the applicable Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions unless a Lender or an Issuing Bank gives notice to the applicable Borrowers that they are obligated to pay an amount under this Section within six months after the later of (i) the date such Lender or such Issuing Bank incurs such increased costs, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital or (ii) the date such Lender or such Issuing Bank has actual knowledge of its incurrence of such increased cost, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
provided
provided
further
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.14, no Lender nor Issuing Bank shall demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction referred to above if it shall not be the general policy or practice of such Lender or such Issuing Bank to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any (it being understood that this sentence shall not in any way limit the discretion of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to waive the right to demand such compensation in any given case).
          SECTION 2.15. . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each applicable Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency or TIBOR Loan, the loss to any applicable Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit in the applicable Currency equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the TIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits in the applicable Currency from other banks in the Eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any

Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          SECTION 2.16. . (a) Each payment made by any Borrower under this Agreement shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Borrower or the Administrative Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be), receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) with respect to which the relevant withholding was made.
Taxes
          (b) The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable by such Borrower under this Section unless such amounts have been included in any amount paid pursuant to the proviso to Section 2.16(a)) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Borrower, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Taxes or, in the case of any Borrower, Excluded Taxes, attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Borrower, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes (or, in the case of a Borrower, Excluded Taxes) were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for the portion of any interest, expenses or penalties that are found by a final non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Lender by the Administrative Agent or a Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
provided
 
          (e) If a Lender or the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank receives a refund or credit in respect of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund or credit to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund, as determined by such Lender in its reasonable discretion, or credit, as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit); that such Borrower, upon the request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower ( penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund or credit to such Governmental Authority.
provided
plus
          (f) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          (g) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
          (h) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Time Warner (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a statement signed by an authorized signatory of the Lender that it is a U.S. Person and, if necessary to avoid United States backup withholding, a duly completed and signed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form) establishing that such Lender is organized under the laws of the United States and is not subject to United States backup withholding.
          (i) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require any Lender to disclose any confidential information regarding its tax returns or affairs.
          SECTION 2.17. . (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim.

All such payments shall be made to

The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient in like funds promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder, whether such payments are made in respect of principal, interest or fees, shall be made in the Currency in which the applicable payment obligation is due; that payments in respect of Facility Fees pursuant to Section 2.11 and any other payments (not in respect of principal, interest or fees) or reimbursements shall be payable in Dollars.

          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due from any Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements, then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon owing by any Borrower than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders owing from such Borrower to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by such Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any application of funds attributable to the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim
provided
 
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due from such Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to such Lenders, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of such Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, (i) if the relevant amount is denominated in Pounds Sterling, at the Pound Sterling Overnight Rate, (ii) if the relevant amount is denominated in Dollars, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (iii) if the relevant amount is denominated in any other Currency, at the interest rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent as the rate applicable for overnight settlements between banks for the amount paid by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Borrower.
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(iii), 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c) or shall otherwise become a Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender from or on behalf of any Credit Party or otherwise in respect of the Obligations to satisfy such Lender's obligations to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, the Issuing Banks or the Yen Fronting Lenders under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
          SECTION 2.18. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Such Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then Time Warner may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
 
restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) Time Warner shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Five-Year Commitment is being assigned, each Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks), which consent shall, in each case, not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will be made to a Lender reasonably expected to result in a reduction in the compensation or payments to be paid by the Borrowers pursuant to such sections. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Time Warner to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
          SECTION 2.19. . (a) Not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter of Time Warner or at such other time as is reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (the ""), the Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Equivalent of the total Revolving Credit Exposures of each Class outstanding as of such date.
Prepayments Required Due to Currency Fluctuation
Calculation Time
          (b) If at the Calculation Time, the Dollar Equivalent of the total Revolving Credit Exposures of either Class exceeds the total Commitments of such Class then in effect by 5% or more, then within five Business Days of notice to the Borrowers thereof, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Revolving Loans of such Class (or, in the case of an excess total of Five-Year Revolving Credit Exposure, prepay Swingline Loans or cash collateralize the outstanding Letters of Credit) in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.19(b) shall be construed to require the Administrative Agent to calculate compliance under this Section 2.19(b) other than at the times set forth in Section 2.19(a).
          (c) If at the Calculation Time, the Dollar Equivalent of the total Yen Loans of either Class exceeds the total Yen Commitments of such Class then in effect by 5% or more, then within five Business Days of notice to the Borrowers thereof, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Yen Loans of such Class in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to such excess. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.19(c) shall be construed to require the Administrative Agent to calculate compliance under this Section 2.19(c) other than at the times set forth in Section 2.19(a).
          SECTION 2.20. . Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro in any Participating Member State and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. Each obligation under this Agreement of a party to this Agreement which has been denominated in the National Currency Unit of a Subsequent Participant shall be redenominated into the Euro in accordance with EMU Legislation immediately upon such Subsequent Participant becoming a Participating Member State (but otherwise in accordance with EMU Legislation). If, in relation
Adoption of the Euro
 
to the currency of any Subsequent Participant, the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to such currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such Subsequent Participant becomes a Participating Member State; that if any Loan in the currency of such Subsequent Participant which is subject to an Interest Period is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

At any time prior to the applicable Maturity Date, Time Warner may from time to time, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to the Lenders) executed by Time Warner and one or more financial institutions that qualify as Eligible Assignees (any such financial institution, which may include any Lender, referred to in this Section being called an "") cause the Three-Year Commitments and/or the Five-Year Commitments of the Increasing Lenders to be increased (or cause the Increasing Lenders to make new Three-Year Commitments and/or Five-Year Commitments, as applicable) in an amount for each Increasing Lender (which shall not be less than $5,000,000) set forth in such notice; that (i) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment of either Class pursuant to this Section, (ii) all new Three-Year Commitments and increases in existing Three-Year Commitments becoming effective under this Section during the term of this Agreement shall not exceed $500,000,000 in the aggregate, (iii) all new Five-Year Commitments and increases in existing Five-Year Commitments becoming effective under this Section during the term of this Agreement shall not exceed $500,000,000 in the aggregate, (iv) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be reasonably satisfactory to (A) the Administrative Agent and (B) each Swingline Lender, Issuing Bank and Yen Fronting Lender whose approval would be required under Section 9.04(b) if such Increasing Lender were being assigned a Commitment of the same Class (which approvals, in the case of both (A) and (B), shall not be unreasonably withheld), (v) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a duly executed accession agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and Time Warner (an "") and (vi) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. New Commitments and increases in Commitments of any Class pursuant to this Section (a "") shall become effective on the date (the "") specified in the applicable Accession Agreement.

On the Increase Effective Date, (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Borrowings of the applicable Class of Revolving Loans outstanding (the "") immediately prior to the Commitment Increase on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid, (ii) each Increasing Lender that shall have had a Commitment of the applicable Class of Revolving Loans prior to the Commitment Increase shall pay to the Administrative Agent in same day funds (in the applicable Currencies), an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the applicable

provided

          (b) Time Warner may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Defaulting Lender and the Administrative Agent, terminate as a whole, or from time to time reduce in part, any Commitment or Commitments, whether used or unused, of such Lender (in which case, if such Lender is a Yen Fronting Lender, the corresponding Yen Commitment of such Lender shall simultaneously terminate or be reduced ratably, as applicable); that (i) Time Warner shall have notified such Lender and the Administrative Agent of such termination or reduction (including the amount thereof), (ii) at the time thereof, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (iii) after giving effect thereto, including the adjustment to the Applicable Percentage of each Lender resulting therefrom, and to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the Revolving Credit Exposure of either Class of any Lender (excluding any portion thereof attributable to the Specified Loans of such Lender) shall not exceed the applicable Commitment of such Lender;
provided
          (c) Facility Fees shall cease to accrue on the unused Commitments of such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.11(a);
          (d) the Commitments and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); that this clause (d) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender affected thereby (if such Defaulting Lender is a Lender affected thereby);
provided
          (e) in the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Five-Year Lender, if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
     (i) all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated automatically among the non-Defaulting Five-Year Lenders in accordance with their respective Five-Year Applicable Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Five-Year Revolving Credit Exposures such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Five-Year Commitments; that any such reallocation shall not be made so long as any Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

     (iii) amounts deposited pursuant to clause (ii) above at the request of any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse such Issuing Bank or such Swingline Lender for any participations required to be funded by such Defaulting Lender. In the event amounts so deposited with respect to any such Defaulting Lender for the benefit of any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender exceed the remaining LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender attributable to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank or the remaining Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender attributable to the Swingline Loans made by such Swingline Lender, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to Time Warner and, unless otherwise specified in writing by Time Warner, shall promptly return to Time Warner cash in the amount of such excess;
     (iv) if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;

     (vi) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all Facility Fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Five-Year Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) under Section 2.11(a) and Letter of Credit Fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to such Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and

be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless (x) the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender has been reallocated in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(e)(i) or (y) it has received assurances satisfactory to it that cash collateral will be provided by Time Warner in accordance with Section 2.21(e)(ii);
          (f) if any Yen Exposure of either Class exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
     (i) all or any part of the Yen Exposure of each Class of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated automatically among the non-Defaulting Lenders of such Class in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages of such Class but only to the extent that, with respect to each Class, the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class such Defaulting Lender's Yen Exposure of such Class does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments of such Class; that any such reallocation shall not be made so long as any Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

provided
     (ii) if (w) the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, (x) the applicable Lender has become a Defaulting Lender other than solely under clause (f) of the definition of such term, (y) the Defaulting Lender shall not have made an assignment and delegation pursuant to Section 2.22(a) above and (z) the Commitment of either Class of such Defaulting Lender shall not have been terminated pursuant to Section 2.22(b) above within 20 days after receipt by Time Warner of written notice from the Administrative Agent that such Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, then upon the written request of any Yen Fronting Lender of the applicable Class, Time Warner shall deposit, within five Business Days after its receipt of such request, in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent, Yen in an amount requested in such notice, such amount not to exceed the remaining Yen Exposure of the applicable Class of such Defaulting Lender at the time of such request attributable to the Yen Loans of such Class made by such Yen Fronting Lender; and
     (iii) amounts deposited pursuant to clause (ii) above at the request of any Yen Fronting Lender shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to prepay a portion of the Yen Loans of such Yen Fronting Lender in an amount equal to any participations therein required to be funded by such Defaulting Lender; any such prepayment shall not affect the participations in such Yen Loans of the non-Defaulting Lenders; and
          (g) any Specified Loans that are repaid or prepaid shall not be reborrowed.
          It is understood and agreed that (i) upon any termination or reduction of the Commitment of either Class of any Defaulting Lender under clause (b) above, the Three-Year Applicable Percentage or Five-Year Applicable Percentage, as the case may be, of such Lender and each other Lender shall at such time automatically adjust in accordance with the definition of
 
the term "Three-Year Applicable Percentage" or "Five-Year Applicable Percentage", as applicable, and (ii) a termination or reduction of the Commitment of either Class of any Defaulting Lender under clause (b) above shall not require a prepayment of any Loan of the applicable Class of such Defaulting Lender then outstanding, and each such Loan of such Class shall continue to be outstanding as part of the applicable Borrowing in accordance with the terms hereof.
          In the event that the Commitment or Yen Commitment of any Defaulting Lender is terminated pursuant to this Section, such Commitment or Yen Commitment may be replaced by a Commitment or Commitments, or Yen Commitment or Yen Commitments, of any one or more Lenders of the applicable Class that is willing to provide such replacement Commitment or Yen Commitment, pursuant to a written agreement of Time Warner, the Administrative Agent and any such Lender or Lenders.
          In the event that the Administrative Agent and Time Warner agree that a Three-Year Lender that is a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Three-Year Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then such Three-Year Lender shall purchase at par such of the Three-Year Revolving Loans of the other Three-Year Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Three-Year Lender to hold such Three-Year Revolving Loans in accordance with its Three-Year Applicable Percentage (as in effect immediately prior to such Lender having become a Defaulting Lender).
          In the event that the Administrative Agent, Time Warner, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Five-Year Lender that is a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Five-Year Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Five-Year Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Five-Year Lender's Five-Year Commitment and on such date such Five-Year Lender shall purchase at par such of the Five-Year Revolving Loans of the other Five-Year Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Five-Year Lender to hold such Five-Year Revolving Loans in accordance with its Five-Year Applicable Percentage (as in effect immediately prior to such Lender having become a Defaulting Lender).

     (m) except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, the Guarantee shall cease, for any reason, to be in full force and effect with respect to any Guarantor or any Credit Party shall so assert; or
     (n) a Change in Control shall occur;
then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to a Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to Time Warner, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of any Borrower accrued hereunder (including all amounts of LC Exposure, whether or not the beneficiary of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required therein), shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower; and in case of any
 
event with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of any Borrower accrued hereunder (including all amounts of LC Exposure, whether or not the beneficiary of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required therein), shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower. With respect to all Letters of Credit with respect to which presentment for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an acceleration pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Borrower shall at such time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Five-Year Lenders, an amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, if any. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made in Cash Equivalents, or upon mutual consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, any other investment (in each case at the Borrowers' risk and expense), such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all reimbursement obligations shall have been satisfied and all other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to the Borrowers (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled thereto).
          Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
          Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Company or Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
 
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Credit Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders) and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all the Lenders, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Article VII and Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by any Borrower, or a Lender or an Issuing Bank, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under any Credit Document or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Credit Documents or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by a proper Person. An initial list of the proper Persons with respect to the Borrowers appears on Schedule 8. Schedule 8 shall not be altered except in writing by a Person appearing thereon (or by a successor to such Person occupying the equivalent office). The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon so long as such statement, in the case of a Borrowing Request, complies with the requirements of Section 2.03 in all material respects (it being understood that oral notices of borrowing will be confirmed in writing by such Borrower in accordance with Section 2.03). In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Credit Document by or through any one or more
 
sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor which, so long as no Event of Default is continuing, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor; that the predecessor Administrative Agent shall pay the unearned portion of any fees paid in advance to either the successor Administrative Agent or the Borrowers. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
provided
          Any resignation by Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article VIII shall also constitute its resignation as a Swingline Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as a Swingline Lender the retiring Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents.
          The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), ratably according to their Commitments in effect (or at any time after the Commitments have terminated, their Revolving Credit Exposures) on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Article VIII (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Commitments (or, if the Commitments have terminated earlier, their Revolving Credit Exposures) immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated
 
hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
provided
          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
          The Joint-Lead Arrangers, Joint Bookrunners, Co-Syndication Agents and Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities under any Credit Document in their capacity as such.

          SECTION 9.02. . (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any

     (c) Each of TBS and HBO hereby authorizes each Lender at any time and from time to time when any amounts owed by Historic TW under this Guarantee are due and payable and have not been paid (taking into account any applicable grace periods), to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of either TBS or HBO (other than indebtedness related to commercial advertising and marketing arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business) against any of and all of the obligations of TBS or HBO, as applicable, to such Lender hereunder now or hereafter existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. Each Lender shall notify TBS and/or HBO, as the case may be, promptly of any such setoff and the application made by such Lender of the proceeds thereof; that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any Guarantor hereunder, or any setoff or application of funds of any Guarantor by any Lender, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or against any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations or the Historic TW Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from either one or both of the Designated Borrowers in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrowers on account of the Obligations are paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding (unless such Letter of Credit is cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.05(c) of the Credit Agreement) and the Commitments of each Class are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine.
No Subrogation
          6. . Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor, and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, (a) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations and any of the Historic TW Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any of the Obligations and any of the Historic TW Obligations continued, (b) the Obligations and/or the Historic TW Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (c) the Credit Agreement and any other Credit Document may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, and (d) any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations and/or the Historic TW Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto.
Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights

Each Guarantor waives diligence,
Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional

presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any Guarantor with respect to the Obligations or the Historic TW Obligations. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, any of the Obligations or the Historic TW Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or any Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers from the Obligations or of Historic TW from the Historic TW Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making a demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against either Designated Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or the Historic TW Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from either Designated Borrower, any such other Guarantor or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of either Designated Borrower, any such other Guarantor or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
          8. . This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations or any of the Historic TW Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or Historic TW or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, either one or both of the Designated Borrowers or Historic TW or any substantial part of either Designated Borrower's or Historic TW's property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

     (b) The Guarantors agree that the foregoing representation and warranty shall be deemed to have been made by each Guarantor and shall be true and correct in all material respects on the date of each borrowing by a Borrower under the Credit Agreement on and as of such date of borrowing as though made hereunder on and as of such date.
          11. . Each Guarantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Guarantee with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Guarantee shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and any or all of the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Guarantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.
Authority of Administrative Agent
          12. . All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Guarantor shall be effected in the manner provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement; any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to such Guarantor at its notice address set forth on Schedule 1 hereto.
Notices
          13. . Any provision of this Guarantee which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Severability
          14. . This Guarantee and the other Credit Documents represent the agreement of each Guarantor with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no promises or representations by the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not reflected herein or in the other Credit Documents.

further
          16. .

In connection with any such release, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to Time Warner or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor, at Time Warner's expense, all documents and shall take all such actions as are reasonably requested by Time Warner to evidence such release and to effect the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantees and other obligations contained in the Guarantee. The execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to or representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
Release of Subsidiary Guarantors
          17. . Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 15 hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default or in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.
