On March 10, 2011, Charlie Sheen and 9 Step Productions (collectively, "Sheen") filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles against WB Studio Enterprises, Inc. ("WB Studios"), a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., and Chuck Lorre and Chuck Lorre Productions, the co-creator and co-executive producer of the television series . Plaintiffs' complaint asserts several causes of action in connection with WB Studios' termination of Sheen's contract for the series, including breach of contract claims and intentional interference tort claims. Plaintiffs' complaint seeks monetary damages of $100 million, among other damages in unspecified amounts. WB Studios, through its division Warner Bros.
