Item 5.03  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Certificate of Amendment to Restated Certificate of Incorporation
On May 24, 2011, Time Warner Inc. (the Company) filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amendment), which became effective upon filing.  The Amendment, which was approved by the Companys stockholders at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 20, 2011 (the Annual Meeting), removed the remaining provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation that provided for stockholder action by more than a simple majority vote (i.e., a majority of the votes cast) other than for actions for which Delaware corporation law requires a different vote standard. The Amendment is described in the Companys definitive Proxy Statement dated April 8, 2011 (the 2011 Proxy Statement) under the caption Company Proposals  Proposal 5: Approval of an Amendment to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Remove Absolute Majority Vote Provisions, and such description is incorporated herein by reference.  A copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Amendment to By-laws
In December 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved an amendment to the By-laws of the Company to change the required vote of the stockholders to amend the By-laws to a simple majority vote from an absolute majority standard, subject to and effective upon the approval by the Companys stockholders of the Amendment described above.  The amendment to the By-laws therefore became effective on May 20, 2011 upon the stockholders approval of the Amendment.  The By-laws, as amended, are filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 5.07  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
The final results of voting on each of the matters submitted to a vote of security holders at the Annual Meeting are as follows.

Any such proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of such meeting at or prior to the time designated for holding such meeting, but in any event not later than the time designated in the order of business for so delivering such proxies.  No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

Public Announcements
 SECTION 1.  .  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
   
   
   
General Powers
 SECTION 2.  .  Except as otherwise fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of Article IV of the Certificate relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or series of stock having preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up, the number of directors constituting the Whole Board shall be determined from time to time by the Board.  The term Whole Board shall mean the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies or unfilled previously authorized directorships.
   
   
   
Number, Qualification and Election
 
 The directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or
   
   
   
 
 
7
 
 
 
series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock of the Corporation as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up pursuant to the terms of Article IV of the Certificate or any resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such stock adopted by the Board, shall be elected by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon at each annual meeting of the stockholders, and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until each of their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.
 
 Each director shall be at least 21 years of age.  Directors need not be stockholders of the Corporation.
   
   
   
 In any uncontested election of directors, each person receiving a majority of the votes cast shall be deemed elected.  For purposes of this paragraph, a majority of the votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast for a director must exceed the number of votes cast against that director (with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as a vote cast with respect to that director).  In any contested election of directors, the persons receiving a plurality of the votes cast, up to the number of directors to be elected in such election, shall be deemed elected.  Any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast shall submit an offer to resign from the Board no later than two weeks after the certification by the Corporation of the voting results. An uncontested election is one in which the number of individuals who have been nominated for election as a director is equal to, or less than, the number of directors constituting the Whole Board.  A contested election is one in which the number of persons nominated exceeds the number of directors to be elected as of the date that is ten days prior to the date that the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders.
   
   
   
 The Board shall consider the resignation offer and may either (i) accept the offer of resignation or (ii) reject the offer and seek to address the underlying cause(s) of the majority-withheld vote.  While the Board may delegate to a committee the authority to assist the Board in its review of the matter, the Board shall decide whether to accept or reject the resignation offer within 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote.  Once the Board makes this decision, the Corporation will promptly make a public announcement of the Boards decision in the manner described in Section 11 of Article II. If the Board rejects the offer of resignation, the public announcement will include a statement regarding the reasons for its decision.
   
   
   
 
 The chairman of the nominating and governance committee described in Section 1 of Article IV will have the authority to manage the Boards review of the resignation offer. In the event it is the chairman of the nominating and governance committee who received a majority-withheld vote, the independent directors who did not receive majority-withheld votes shall select a director to manage the process, and that director shall have the authority otherwise delegated to the chairman of the nominating and governance committee by this Section 2 of
   
   
   
 
 
8
 
 
 
Article III. Any director who tenders his or her offer of resignation as a result of a majority-withheld vote shall not participate in the committees or the Boards deliberations or vote on whether to accept or reject the resignation offer.
 A majority of the members of the Board shall be persons determined by the Board to be independent directors.  In order to determine that a director is independent pursuant to this Section 2, the Board shall make an affirmative determination that the director satisfies applicable regulatory requirements to be an independent director of the Corporation, that the director has no material relationship with the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), and that the director is free of any other relationship (with the Company or otherwise) that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by such director.  In making this determination, the Board shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including commercial, charitable, and familial relationships that exist between the director and the Company, or between entities with which the director is affiliated and the Company. The Board may, from time to time, adopt categorical standards to guide its determination of materiality.
   
   
   
 SECTION 3.  .  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board or by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice of nomination provided for in this Section 3 and who is entitled to vote for the election of directors.  Any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors at a meeting may nominate persons for election as directors only if timely written notice of such stockholders intent to make such nomination is given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary.  To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of the stockholders, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting; , , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered or received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made; ,, that for the purpose of calculating the timeliness of stockholder notices for the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders, the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting shall be deemed to be May 18, 2000 and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors, not earlier than the 90th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day

prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees to be elected at such meeting. Each such notice shall set forth:  (a) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporations books, of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and the name and address of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder; (c) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (d) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (e) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had each nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; (f) the executed written consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected; and (g) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such stockholders nominee(s), a representation to that effect.  The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the stockholder solicits proxies in favor of such stockholders nominee(s) without having made the representations required by the immediately preceding sentence.  If such stockholder does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at such meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.  Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3 shall be eligible to serve as directors of the Corporation.
 
 Notwithstanding anything in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 3 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting of the stockholders is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for directors or specifying the size of the increased Board made by the Corporation at least 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to or mailed to and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
