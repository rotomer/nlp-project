DALLAS (Jan. 26, 2004)  Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today reported that fourth quarter 2003 revenue of $2770 million increased 9 percent sequentially and 29 percent from the year-ago period due to robust growth across almost all of the company's Semiconductor product lines.
 
For the year, TI revenue was $9834 million, up 17 percent from 2002 due to growth in Semiconductor that was led by demand for Digital Signal Processors (DSP) across the wireless, digital consumer and broadband markets.
 
Earnings per share were $0.29 in the quarter, including a $0.07 contribution from the sale of Micron Technology, Inc. common stock and a $0.02 contribution from a reduction in TI's estimated taxes for 2003.
 
Semiconductor revenue in the fourth quarter increased 16 percent sequentially and 34 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to strong demand for a broad range of DSP and
Analog products. For the year, Semiconductor revenue increased 20 percent from 2002, primarily due to strong demand for DSP products. From an end-equipment perspective, higher shipments into the wireless market provided the most significant source of growth as wireless revenue increased 23 percent sequentially, 41 percent from the year-ago quarter and 32 percent for the year.
 
"The fourth quarter marked the second consecutive period of double-digit sequential revenue growth in Semiconductor. The new revenue record for our sales into the wireless market, and the excellent growth in both DSP and high-performance Analog are particularly noteworthy. When compared to competitors, I believe TI's performance for the quarter and for the year will show that this growth is due to both a broad recovery in the market and to gains in market share," said Tom Engibous, TI chairman, president and CEO.
 
"For the year, TI's operating activities generated more than $2 billion in cash flow. We started the year with a very healthy balance sheet, and it grew significantly stronger as TI and the market gained momentum through the course of the year. This strong financial position has allowed us to remain focused on our strategic objectives.
 
"Moving forward, I am pleased by the progress in our high-performance Analog competitiveness, where our position is strengthening both technologically and with customers. Additionally, the fundamentals of wireless continue to be attractive as expanding handset functionality based on TI technology increases our semiconductor content in each handset. Looking ahead, our R&D investments in OMAP
TM
application processors, in complete chipset solutions and in new standard products for the CDMA market should provide new opportunities for our wireless technologies," Engibous said.
 
"In wireless and other targeted markets such as broadband communications and digital consumer, we have combined our systems skills with our DSP and Analog technologies and leading manufacturing capabilities to deliver product solutions that generate unprecedented levels of TI content in our customers' equipment. We will continue to offer our customers more complete solutions, and as we do, I believe our financial results will reflect the increased value we bring to their systems.
 
"Because we have maintained high levels of R&D investment, we are well-positioned to advance in existing markets and enter new markets early. This is particularly important as the strength of the overall market for semiconductors improves. Manufacturing capacity and demand are more in balance today than at any time in the last three years, resulting in an encouraging outlook for revenue and profits in the year ahead," he said.
 
Details of Financial Results
 
Revenue
 
In the fourth quarter, TI revenue of $2770 million increased by $237 million sequentially and increased by $624 million from the year-ago quarter.
 
For the year, TI revenue of $9834 million increased $1451 million from 2002.
 
Charges
 
In the fourth quarter, the company incurred $13 million in charges related to previously announced restructuring actions, of which $11 million is included in cost of revenue and $2 million is included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense.
 
For the year, the company incurred $118 million in restructuring charges, of which $102 million is included in cost of revenue, $14 million in SG&A expense and $2 million in research and development (R&D) expense. When completed at the end of 2004, the restructuring actions are expected to result in about $105 million of annual savings, of which $65 million will be in Semiconductor and $40 million will be in Sensors & Controls.
 
For the year, the company also incurred a non-tax-deductible $23 million in-process R&D charge in the third quarter related to the company's acquisition of Radia Communications, Inc., and a $10 million charge in other income (expense) net (OI&E) in the first quarter related to the redemption of $250 million in convertible notes issued by Burr-Brown Corporation, which TI acquired in 2000.
 
Gross Profit
 
In the fourth quarter, gross profit of $1194 million increased 16 percent sequentially and 55 percent from the year-ago period primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin was 43.1 percent of revenue, up 2.4 percentage points sequentially primarily due to lower restructuring charges, and up 7.3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter due to greater utilization of the company's fixed-cost manufacturing assets in its Semiconductor operations.
 
For the year, gross profit of $3962 million, or 40.3 percent of revenue, increased 29 percent from 2002 due to the impact of higher revenue, which was partially offset by increased restructuring charges of $77 million.
 
Expenses
 
R&D expense of $448 million decreased by $20 million, or 4 percent, sequentially due to the Radia in-process R&D charge incurred in the third quarter. Compared with the year-ago period, R&D expense increased 9 percent due to increased product development in Semiconductor, primarily for wireless. For the year, R&D expense of $1748 million increased 8 percent from 2002 due to increased product development in Semiconductor, primarily for wireless.
 
SG&A expense of $308 million declined 2 percent sequentially due to lower restructuring charges. Compared with the year-ago quarter, SG&A expense increased 6 percent primarily due to higher Semiconductor marketing expenses. For the year, SG&A expense increased 7 percent from 2002 primarily due to higher Semiconductor marketing expenses.
 
Operating Profit
 
Operating profit of $438 million, or 15.8 percent of revenue, increased by $189 million, or 76 percent, sequentially and increased by $371 million, or 557 percent, from the year-ago quarter due to higher gross profit.
 
For the year, operating profit of $965 million, or 9.8 percent of revenue, increased 235 percent from 2002 due to higher gross profit.
 
Other Income (Expense) Net and Interest Expense
 
OI&E of $131 million decreased $12 million sequentially primarily due to lower gains on the company's fourth-quarter sales of Micron common stock, which TI received in connection with the sale of its memory business unit to Micron in 1998.
 
Compared with the year-ago period, OI&E increased by $751 million. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company recorded a $638 million impairment write-down of its holdings of Micron common stock. As previously announced, TI sold a portion of its Micron stock in the third quarter of 2003 for a pre-tax gain of $106 million, and TI sold its remaining shares in the fourth quarter of 2003 for a pre-tax gain of $97 million.
 
For the year, OI&E of $324 million increased by $901 million from 2002.
 
Interest expense of $8 million was about even sequentially. Interest expense decreased by $6 million compared with the year-ago quarter and by $18 million from 2002 due to the company's lower debt level.
 
Net Income
 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $512 million, or $0.29 per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20 percent. This rate is exclusive of the tax impact resulting from the recognition of the previously reserved tax benefit of $62 million associated with TI's impairment write-down of Micron stock in the fourth quarter of 2002. During the quarter, the company realized a $37 million tax reduction due to changes in the company's estimate of its foreign tax liabilities, which resulted in an effective tax rate that was lower than the company's previous estimate of 26 percent.
 
For the year, net income of $1198 million, or $0.68 cents per share, increased by $1542 million from 2002. Within the increase, $993 million was due to the impact of the Micron stock-related actions, and $440 million was due to higher operating profit. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 22 percent.
 
Orders
 
TI orders of $3076 million increased 16 percent sequentially and 47 percent from the year-ago quarter due to strength in Semiconductor orders. Semiconductor orders of $2744 million increased 20 percent sequentially and 56 percent from the year-ago period due to broad-based demand for Analog and DSP products. The Semiconductor book-to-bill ratio for the fourth quarter rose to 1.12.
 
For the year, TI orders of $10344 million increased 23 percent from 2002, and Semiconductor orders of $8854 million increased 27 percent, reflecting broad-based demand for DSP and Analog products.
 
Cash
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and long-term cash investments) of $5664 million was up $1126 million from the end of the third quarter and up $1522 million from the end of 2002.
 
Cash flow from operations increased to $1067 million, up $557 million sequentially and $323 million from the year-ago period. For the year, cash flow from operations increased to $2151 million, up $159 million from 2002.
 
Capital Spending and Depreciation
 
Capital expenditures of $272 million increased by $39 million sequentially and $36 million from the year-ago quarter. For the year, capital expenditures of $800 million decreased by $2 million from 2002. TI's capital expenditures in 2003 were primarily for the deployment of advanced Semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.
 
In the fourth quarter, depreciation of $370 million increased by $14 million sequentially and decreased $27 million from the year-ago period. For the year, depreciation was $1429 million, down $145 million from 2002.
 
Accounts Receivable and Inventory
 
Accounts receivable of $1451 million decreased $71 million sequentially due to seasonally lower Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) graphing calculator revenue, and increased by $234 million from the end of 2002 due to higher Semiconductor revenue. Days sales outstanding were 47 at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 54 at the end of the prior quarter and 51 at the end of 2002.
 
Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter decreased $11 million sequentially, to $984 million, due to the seasonal decline in E&PS inventory. Inventory increased by $194 million compared with the end of 2002 to support higher Semiconductor shipment levels. Days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter were 56, down from 60 days at the end of the prior quarter and up from 52 days at the end of 2002.
 
Debt
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the debt-to-total capital ratio was 0.07, unchanged from the end of the prior quarter and down from 0.10 at the end of 2002 due to reductions in debt.
 
Outlook
 
TI intends to provide a mid-quarter update to its financial outlook on March 8 by issuing a press release and holding a conference call. Both will be available on the company's web site.
 
For the first quarter of 2004, TI expects revenue to be in the following ranges:
 
 
 
 
 
TI expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.22.
 
For 2004, TI expects: R&D to be about $2.0 billion, capital expenditures to be about $1.1 billion and depreciation to be about $1.4 billion.
 
The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be about 30 percent.
 
TI expects that 2004 earnings will reflect revenue growth and higher operating margins. This performance is expected to exceed the company's the minimum threshold for the TI employee profit-sharing program. As a result, the company expects to make an accrual for profit sharing in the first quarter of 2004 and in each subsequent quarter. Profit-sharing expenses are accrued quarterly based on the company's estimate of its full-year financial performance. No accrual for profit sharing was made under this program in any quarter during 2003 and 2002.

products, and higher royalties. Revenue from microcontrollers was about even sequentially and increased compared with the year-ago quarter. For the year, remaining Semiconductor revenue increased 14 percent from 2002 due to higher demand for DLP, RISC microprocessors and standard logic products, and higher royalties, which more than offset a decline in microcontrollers.
