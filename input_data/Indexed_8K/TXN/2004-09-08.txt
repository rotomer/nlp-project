Exhibit 99 ---------- NEWS RELEASE C-04041 TI UPDATES THIRD-QUARTER 2004 BUSINESS OUTLOOK - - Revenue Expected between $3100 Million and $3240 Million - - EPS Expected between $0.27 and $0.29 CONFERENCE CALL ON TI WEB SITE AT 3:30 P.M. CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME TODAY WWW.TI.COM ---------- DALLAS (Sept. 8, 2004) - In a scheduled update to its business outlook for the third quarter of 2004, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE:TXN) today revised its expected revenue and earnings ranges. This update reflects what TI believes are adjustments by customers as they move quickly to reduce inventory levels to more closely match their own end-equipment growth rates. These adjustments are more aggressive in standard products sold through the distribution channel than in other areas. The company's expectations for revenue are: - - Total revenue between $3100 million and $3240 million, compared with the prior range of $3200 million to $3440 million; - - Semiconductor revenue between $2665 million and $2785 million, compared with the prior range of $2780 million to $2980 million; - - Sensors & Controls revenue between $260 million and $270 million, compared with the prior range of $255 million to $275 million; and - - Educational & Productivity Solutions revenue between $175 million and $185 million, compared with the prior range of $170 million to $190 million. TI expects earnings per share (EPS) between $0.27 and $0.29, compared with the previous range of $0.26 to $0.29. The company's revised earnings estimate reflects reduced factory loadings and a lower expected accrual for profit sharing. Additionally, the effective annual tax rate has been reduced from 29 percent to 26 percent, primarily due to an increase in the estimated tax benefit for export sales. Including catch-up adjustments, the third-quarter effective tax rate is estimated to be about 21 percent. The company will hold a conference call at 3:30 p.m. CDT today to discuss this update. This conference call will be available live at www.ti.com. TI's original third-quarter outlook was published in the company's second-quarter 2004 earnings release on July 20, available at www.ti.com. TI's third quarter ends on September 30. # # # "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
