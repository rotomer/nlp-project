Exhibit 99 ---------- News Release C-05011 TI Updates First-Quarter 2005 Business Outlook - - Revenue Expected between $2910 Million and $3030 Million - - EPS Expected between $0.22 and $0.24 Conference Call on TI Web Site at 4 p.m. Central Standard Time Today www.ti.com ---------- DALLAS (March 7, 2005) - In a scheduled update to its business outlook for the first quarter of 2005, Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE:TXN) today narrowed its expected ranges for revenue and earnings per share (EPS). The updated estimates reflect lower-than-expected demand for DLP(TM) products used in televisions and projectors. Even though TI believes DLP-based televisions and projectors gained share in 2004, customers had built for more robust end-of-year sales. Customers are taking aggressive actions to reduce these inventories as quickly as possible. Additionally, the updated estimates include the expected impact of the company's sale of its commodity liquid crystal display driver operations. This transaction should close in the month of March. As expected and previously stated, the ongoing inventory adjustments of semiconductor products in distribution channels have continued in the first quarter. These adjustments are generally on track to be completed by the end of March. The company's expectations for revenue are: - - Total revenue between $2910 million and $3030 million, compared with the prior range of $2900 million to $3140 million; - - Semiconductor revenue between $2550 million and $2650 million, compared with the prior range of $2550 million to $2750 million; - - Sensors & Controls revenue between $285 million and $295 million, compared with the prior range of $280 million to $300 million; and - - Educational & Productivity Solutions revenue between $75 million and $85 million, compared with the prior range of $70 million to $90 million. TI expects EPS between $0.22 and $0.24, compared with the previous range of $0.22 to $0.26. The company will hold a conference call at 4 p.m. CST today to discuss this update. This conference call will be available live at www.ti.com. TI's original first-quarter outlook was published in the company's fourth-quarter and year-end 2004 earnings release on Jan. 25, available at www.ti.com. TI's first quarter ends on March 31. # # # "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
