The person in whose name shares of stock are registered on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed and treated as the owner thereof for all purposes; and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.

The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate, require the owner of the lost, destroyed, or stolen certificate or his legal representatives to give the Corporation a bond in such sum, limited or unlimited, and in such form and with such surety or sureties, as the Board shall in its uncontrolled discretion determine, to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, destruction, or theft of any such certificate, or the issuance of such new certificates.
Section 4

Section 5
   
Fixing Record Date
 
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
 
 
The corporate seal of the Corporation shall be in the form of a circle and shall bear the full name of the Corporation, the state and year of incorporation, and the words Corporate Seal.  Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced. The seal shall be retained by the Secretary.  A duplicate of the seal may be kept and used by the Treasurer, by an Assistant Secretary or Assistant Treasurer, or by any other employee authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors.

Attendance of a person at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
 
 
 
The Board of Directors shall cause to be published and submitted to the stockholders, at least fifteen days in advance of their annual meeting, the Corporations annual financial statement covering the previous fiscal year, and containing such other information and data as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate.
 
 
 
These By-Laws, as they shall be at any time and whether or not previously altered, amended or added to, may be made, altered, amended or repealed from time to time by the Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of a majority of the authorized number of directors at any regular or special meeting of directors if notice of the proposed change was contained in the notice of such meeting.  The stockholders also, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote may from time to time make, alter, amend or repeal the By-Laws at any regular or special meeting if notice of the proposed change was contained in the notice of the meeting; and any addition, alteration, amendment or repeal effected by the Board of Directors may be altered, amended or repealed by the stockholders in the manner hereinabove set forth.
