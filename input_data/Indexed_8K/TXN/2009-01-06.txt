ITEM 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangement of Certain Officers
Effective January 1, 2009, the Registrant's Board of Directors adopted two compensation plans, the TI Deferred Compensation Plan and the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II, to address the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations adopted thereunder, as well as administrative requirements.  A brief description of the terms and conditions of each of the new plans is below, and both are filed as exhibits hereto.
:
TI Deferred Compensation Plan
The TI Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) permits any U.S. employee of the Registrant whose base salary exceeds a level determined by either the Registrants Compensation Committee or management ($135,000 per year in 2008), to defer the receipt of a portion of his or her salary, bonus and profit sharing.  The Registrants existing deferred compensation plan was merged into the DCP.  Deferred compensation account balances are unsecured and all amounts remain part of the companys operating assets.  The balances of the deferred compensation accounts track the performance of investment alternatives selected by the participant.  The Registrant does not guarantee any minimum return on the amounts deferred.  Deferred amounts, including any earnings on the deferred amounts, are generally distributed on a date selected by the participant or on the participants death or entry of a qualified domestic relations order.  Because it is impossible to determine which, if any, of the Registrants executive officers will participate in the DCP, what investment alternatives such executive officers would select and the performance of the investment alternatives, it is impossible to determine what amounts would be payable under the DCP to the executive officers.
:
TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II
The TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II (the Non-qualified Plan) provides supplemental pension benefits to employees who (a) participate in the Registrants qualified defined benefit pension plan but earn a benefit that exceeds the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) limit on annual pension benefits payable ($185,000 in 2008 ) or on qualified plan compensation ($230,000 in 2008) , or (b) elected to participate in the TI Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP") and as a result had certain compensation excluded from consideration under the qualified pension plan.   The benefit under the Non-qualified Plan is the amount by which the qualified pension plan benefit accrued after 2004 (absent the applicable IRS limits or exclusion of DCP elective deferrals) exceeds such benefit (with the applicable IRS limits and exclusion of DCP elective deferrals).  Amounts earned under the Non-qualified Plan are distributed upon separation from service to the Registrant, or upon the participants death or entry of a qualified domestic relations order.  Presently, it is impossible to determine what amounts will be payable under the Non-qualified Plan to the executive officers of the Registrant because of the uncertainty of the executive officers future compensation or DCP deferral elections.
 
ITEM 9.01.  Exhibits
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10(a)
 
 
 
Texas Instruments Incorporated, a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in Dallas, Texas (hereinafter referred to as TI or the Company), froze the TI Deferred Compensation Plan (the Frozen DCP), effective as of December 31, 2004, to new participants, to new elective deferrals and to benefits under the Frozen DCP to the extent benefits under that plan were earned and vested as of that date.  Effective as of January 1, 2005, TI established a new deferred compensation plan (the New Plan) in order (i) to provide a select group of management or highly compensated employees described in Section 201(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) with the opportunity to defer payment of certain compensation and benefits earned from and after January 1, 2005 to a later date, (ii) to provide for the payment of benefits under the Frozen DCP which were not earned and vested as of January 1, 2005, and (iii) to restore certain benefits earned and/or vested on or after January 1, 2005, which cannot be provided under the TI Contribution and 401(k) Savings Plan or the TI 401(k) Savings Plan as a result of that deferral of compensation or by reason of the application of Section 401(a)(17) and/or Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), all in accordance with the interim guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code.  The benefits provided under the New Plan are unfunded with the result that the participants in the Plan are general unsecured creditors of TI.  TI hereby amends and restates the New Plan, effective as of January 1, 2009 (the A&R Plan or the Plan), in the form provided herein in order, among other things, to establish the name of the A&R Plan as the TI Deferred Compensation Plan and to comply with the Final Treasury Regulations of Section 409A of the Code.
Prior to January 1, 2009, the deferral of amounts and restoration of benefits pursuant to the New Plan was governed by the applicable interim guidance under Section 409A of the Code in effect prior to January 1, 2009, and the deferral of compensation earned from and after January 1, 2009 and the restoration of benefits from and after January 1, 2009, as well as all amounts in a Participants Accounts on or after January 1, 2009, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this A&R Plan.
Effective as of November 1, 2008, the Frozen DCP was merged into the New Plan in order to permit the election provisions described in this A&R Plan which took effect as of November 1, 2008 to apply to all of the amounts under the Frozen DCP, except for the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals, and as a result of that merger and material modification of the Frozen DCP, it became subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code as of November 1, 2008, for all of the amounts in the Frozen DCP other than the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals.  The amounts in the accounts of the participants in the Frozen DCP (except for the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals) were governed by the terms and conditions of the New Plan until January 1, 2009 (except for the election provisions set forth herein which took effect as of November 1, 2008), and from and after January 1, 2009, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this A&R Plan.  The terms of the Frozen DCP as in effect prior to November 1, 2008 shall remain applicable to and shall govern the Frozen Non-Qualified Pension Plan Deferrals.  In addition, any amounts in pay status as of November 1, 2008, whether originally payable from the Frozen DCP or the New Plan, shall continue to be payable pursuant to the terms of the Frozen DCP as in effect prior to November 1, 2008 or the New Plan, as the case may be.

Whether a Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable Emergency under the Plan is to be determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances of each case, but in any case, a withdrawal on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency may not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved (a) through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, (b) by liquidation of the Participants assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or (c) by cessation of deferrals under the Plan.
Withdrawal because of an Unforeseeable Emergency must be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need (which may include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, local, or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution), as determined by the Administration Committee, in its sole discretion.  The Participant must apply in writing for a payment upon an Unforeseeable Emergency, using the form prescribed by the Administration Committee.  The Administration Committee retains the sole and absolute discretion to grant or deny a payment upon an Unforeseeable Emergency.

No order issued pursuant to an Alternative Payee Claim may require payment in any other form than a full lump sum distribution equal to the present value (as determined by the Administration Committee) of the Alternate Payee Claim.  The provisions of Section 3-6 governing changes in the time and form of payment of benefits under this Plan do not apply to elections by individuals other than the Participant, with respect to payments to a person other than the Participant, to the extent such elections are reflected in or made in accordance with the terms of a domestic relations order (as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code).

Construction

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in Dallas, Texas (hereinafter referred to as TI or the Company), froze the TI Employees Supplemental Pension Plan (the "Frozen Plan"), effective as of December 31, 2004, to the extent benefits under that plan were earned and vested as of that date, and continued said plan in accordance with its terms, to provide for the payment of the benefits which were earned, vested and frozen as of December 31, 2004.  Subsequently, TI changed the name of the Frozen Plan to the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan.
 
Effective as of January 1, 2005, TI established a new non-qualified pension plan (the New Plan) in order to provide (i) for the payment of the frozen earned benefits under the Frozen Plan which were not vested as of January 1, 2005, and (ii) to provide a select group of management or highly compensated employees described in Section 201(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) with the opportunity to restore certain benefits which cannot be provided under the TI Employees Pension Plan from and after January 1, 2005 as a result of (a) deferral of compensation under a new deferred compensation plan established effective as of January 1, 2005  (known from and after January 1, 2009 as the TI Deferred Compensation Plan), or (b) the application of Section 401(a)(17) and/or Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).  TI maintained the New Plan in accordance with the interim guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code.  In additionnew deferred compensation plan established effective as of January 1, 2005.  The benefits provided under the New Plan are unfunded with the result that the participants in the Plan are general unsecured creditors of TI.
,
for periods prior to January 1, 2009 the benefits payable under the New Plan may be deferred pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
 
TI hereby amends and restates the New Plan, effective as of January 1, 2009 (the Plan), in the form provided herein in order to remove the option of deferring payment of the benefits under this Plan, to remove the entitlement to benefits upon a Change in Control, as defined in the New Plan, to comply with the Final Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Code and to name the New Plan the TI Non-Qualified Pension Plan II.  With respect to benefits or contributions lost under the TI Employees Pension Plan by reason of the operation of Section 415 of the Code, this Plan is intended to constitute an excess benefit plan, as defined in Section 3 of ERISA, that is exempt from the provisions of ERISA by reason of Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA.
 
Except as otherwise provided herein, the earning of benefits and payment of those benefits under the New Plan shall be governed by the applicable interim guidance under Section 409A of the Code in effect prior to January 1, 2009, and the earning of benefits and payment of those benefits from and after January 1, 2009 shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Plan.
