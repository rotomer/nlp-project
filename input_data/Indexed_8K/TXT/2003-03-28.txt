Exhibit 99
 
Providence, Rhode Island - March 27, 2003
- Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) today announced that it now expects full-year 2003 diluted earnings per share will be between $2.40 and $2.60, with first quarter diluted earnings per share between $0.51 and $0.53. Previously, the company expected full-year 2003 and first quarter diluted earnings per share of approximately $3.05 and $0.50, respectively. Earnings estimates exclude restructuring costs and other special items.
The company expects full-year 2003 free cash flow before restructuring will be between $300 million and $400 million. Previously, the company expected free cash flow before restructuring of approximately $400 million.
Textron's outlook for 2003 is based on its revised estimate for its Cessna Aircraft business unit to deliver between 180 and 195 jets this year, as well as additional uncertainty related to the current economic and geopolitical situation. Previously, Textron planned to deliver about 220 jets. The revised estimate reflects the company's announcement last week that one of Cessna's largest customers significantly reduced the number of jets that it plans to purchase in 2003 and lower non-fleet jet deliveries expected through the year.
"We are taking aggressive actions at Cessna and across Textron to help offset the impact to earnings from the reduction in business jet deliveries in the current economic environment," said Textron Chairman, President and CEO Lewis B. Campbell.
Campbell added, "In spite of this temporary softening in the business jet market, we believe strong growth will return at Cessna when the economy rebounds and we bring our new jets to market."
Textron presents its outlook before restructuring and other special items, because such items are outside normal business operations, as well as difficult to forecast accurately for specific periods. The outlook is presented in a manner consistent with how operating performance is measured for management compensation purposes. Analysis of outlook before restructuring and other special items should be used only in conjunction with data presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the company's 2003 outlook is attached.
