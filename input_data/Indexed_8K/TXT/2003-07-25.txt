(REVERSE OF SECURITY) TEXTRON INC. 4 1/2% NOTE DUE AUGUST 1, 2010 This Security is a Global Security evidencing a security of the duly authorized series of securities of Textron designated as its 4 1/2% Notes due August 1, 2010 (the securities of such series are herein called the "Securities"), issued under an Indenture, dated as of September 10, 1999 (herein called the "Indenture"), between Textron and The Bank of New York, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture). The terms of this Security include those stated in, or made pursuant to, the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and reference is made to the Indenture, all indentures supplemental thereto and all written instruments of Textron establishing such terms for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of Textron, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Global Security is not subject to a mandatory or optional sinking fund requirement. The Securities shall be redeemable, at the option of Textron, in whole or in part on any date prior to Maturity (the "Redemption Date") at the Redemption Price (as defined herein), plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities up to, but not including, the Redemption Date. For all purposes hereof: "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the annual rate equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date: (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (b) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
"Primary Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City. "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by Textron. "Redemption Price" means the greater of: (a) 100% of the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and (b) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal on such Securities and interest on such Securities that would be due after the Redemption Date but for such redemption (not including any portion of such interest payments accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (a) J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., UBS Securities LLC and their successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, Textron shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (b) any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by Textron. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the average, as determined by Textron, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) which such Reference Treasury Dealer quotes in writing to the Trustee at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day before such Redemption Date. The notice of redemption of the Securities may summarize the method by which the Redemption Price will be determined rather than state the actual dollar amount. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of Textron and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by Textron and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by Textron with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Global Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Global Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu
hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Global Security. Without the consent of the Holder of any Securities, Textron and the Trustee may enter into one or more indentures supplemental to the Indenture to evidence the succession of another corporation to Textron and the assumption by such successor of the covenants of Textron in the Indenture or this Global Security, to add to the covenants of Textron for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities, to add additional Events of Default, to cure any ambiguity, to correct any defect or inconsistency or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture which shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect or for the other purposes set forth in the Indenture. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth and herein provided, the transfer of this Global Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Global Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of Textron in any place where the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Global Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to Textron and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon a new Global Security evidencing the Securities evidenced hereby, or like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transfer or transferees; provided, however, that for so long as any Securities are evidenced by this Global Security, this Global Security may be transferred in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depository or to a successor Depository selected or approved by Textron or to a nominee of such successor Depository. There is no limit on the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series that may be issued by Textron. Without notice to or consent of any Holder of any Securities of this series, Textron may, from time to time and at any time, issue and sell additional Securities of this series with the same title and terms as this Security, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Securities or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Securities. The Securities of this series are issuable only in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 unless otherwise specified above. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but Textron may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Global Security for registration of transfer, Textron, the Trustee and any agent of Textron or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Global Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Global Security is overdue, and neither Textron, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. If at any time the Depository notifies Textron that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the Securities evidenced hereby or if at any time the Depository shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation and a successor Depository is not appointed by Textron within 90 days after Textron receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, Textron will execute, and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver, Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in denomination of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 (such denominations referred to herein as "authorized denominations"), of like tenor and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security in exchange for this Global Security. In addition, Textron may at any time determine that the Securities evidenced hereby shall no longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event Textron will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination by Textron, will authenticate and deliver Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and of like tenor and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security in exchange for this Global Security. Upon the exchange of this Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form, without coupons, in authorized denominations, this Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for this Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered. All terms used in this Global Security that are defined in the Indenture and not herein otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Offering of $250,000,000 4 1/2% Notes due August 1, 2010; Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-84599) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Associate General Counsel-Securities and Assistant Secretary of Textron Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Textron"). I have acted as counsel to Textron in connection with the public offering of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Textron's 4 1/2% Notes due August 1, 2010 (the "Notes") pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-84599) filed by Textron, Textron Capital II and Textron Capital III (together with Textron Capital II, the "Textron Trusts") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on August 5, 1999 (the "Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement relates to the offering and sale from time to time, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, of up to an aggregate offering price of $2,000,000,000 of unsecured senior debt securities, unsecured subordinated debt securities, unsecured junior subordinated debt securities, common stock and preferred stock of Textron, preferred securities of each of the Textron Trusts and guarantees by Textron for the benefit of the holders of such preferred securities of the Textron Trusts. The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more Global Notes (collectively, the "Global Note"). The Notes are being offered pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated July 22, 2003 filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act on July 24, 2003 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which supplements Textron's prospectus dated August 11, 1999 (the "Prospectus").

This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. In connection with this opinion, I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of: (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Textron, as currently in effect; (ii) the By-Laws of Textron, as currently in effect; (iii) the Registration Statement as filed with the Commission; (iv) the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement as filed with the Commission; (v) the form of the Notes; (vi) an executed copy of the Indenture; (vii) an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2003, between Textron and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and SG Cowen Securities Corporation; (viii) the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, on
Form T-1 of The Bank of New York, as trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; (ix) pertinent resolutions of Textron's Board of Directors and committees thereof; and (x) written actions of delegates of such committees. I have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such records of Textron and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of Textron and others, and such other documents, certificates and records as I have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein. In my examination, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making my examination of documents executed or to be executed by parties other than Textron, I have assumed that such parties had or will have the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. In addition, I have assumed that the Notes, when executed, will be executed in substantially the form reviewed by me. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which I have not independently established or verified, I have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of Textron and others. I am admitted to the bar in the States of New York and Rhode Island, and I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than such States and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported judicial interpretations interpreting these laws). I am not admitted to the practice of law in the State of Delaware. Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other qualifications set forth herein, it is my opinion that when the Global Note (in the form examined by me) has been duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement and has been delivered in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement against payment of the agreed-upon consideration therefor set forth therein, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of Textron, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against Textron in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. I also consent to the references to me under the captions "Legal Opinions" in the Registration Statement and "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Very truly yours, /s/ Michael D. Cahn -------------------------------------------- Senior Associate General Counsel-Securities and Assistant Secretary
