Item 2.06  Material Impairments
 
During 2005, Textron's Fastening Systems segment has experienced declining sales volumes and profits. Volumes were down due to soft demand in the automotive market and operating difficulties.  Profits were down due to the lower volumes, a lag in the ability to recover higher steel costs and inefficiencies associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in North America.  Due to the continuation of these conditions, further softening of demand in the North American automotive market, and an expected decline in the European automotive market, Textron's Management Committee initiated a special review at the end of August to consider strategic alternatives for the segment, including the potential sale of all or portions of its operations.  On September 6, 2005, Textron's Board of Directors approved management's recommendation to explore strategic alternatives for the segment.  Based on the approval of this recommendation and the likelihood of execution, Textron determined on September 6, 2005, that an impairment indicator exists for both the Fastening Systems segment's goodwill and its long-lived assets. Based on the internal analysis performed, management estimates a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge in the range of $300 million to $500 million, primarily related to goodwill. Textron will conduct formal impairment reviews, including engaging third-party valuation experts, of the segment's goodwill and long-lived assets, and will record its best estimate of the charge in the third quarter of 2005.
