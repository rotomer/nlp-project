Providence, RI - January 18, 2007
- Textron Inc. (TXT: NYSE) today announced that it has incurred additional costs related to its Bell Helicopter H-1 program during the fourth quarter of 2006. However, stronger financial performance at Cessna, Textron Systems and Textron Financial, plus a lower tax rate, more than offset the additional H-1 costs booked in the quarter. This will result in reported fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations in excess of the companys previous guidance range of $1.35 - $1.45.
 
The company has moved the timing of its fourth quarter earnings release to 4:00 p.m., Eastern on Wednesday, January 24, 2007, with a conference call to follow at 4:30 p.m., Eastern. The call will be available via webcast at www.textron.com or by direct dial at (888) 428-4474 in the U.S. (
