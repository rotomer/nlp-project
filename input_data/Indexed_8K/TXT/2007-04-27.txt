Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On April 27, 2007, Textron Inc.s wholly-owned subsidiary, Textron Financial Corporation (Textron Financial), amended its Five-Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders. The amendment extends the maturity date from April 2011 to April 2012 and decreases certain fees. Under the amended Credit Agreement, Textron Financial will pay revised quarterly fees that will range from 4.5 basis points to 10 basis points depending on Textron Financials ratings by S&P, Moodys and Fitch (Textron Financials Ratings). At Textron Financials current ratings, the fees are 6 basis points. Under the amended Credit Agreement, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, Textron Financial will pay a margin over LIBOR that will range from 13 basis points to 52.5 basis points, depending on Textron Financials Ratings. In addition Textron Financial will pay a utilization fee that will range, depending on Textron Financials Ratings, from 2.5 basis points to 12.5 basis points on LIBOR borrowings if the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the banks total commitment under the Credit Agreement.  The amendment also increases the debt to net worth covenant limitation from 8:1 to 9:1. The aggregate amount of committed credit remains unchanged at $1.75 billion.
