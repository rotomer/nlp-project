Description
99.1                      Press release dated October 18, 2007 related to earnings.
 

 Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) today reported a 40% increase in earnings per share from continuing operations on a 15% revenue increase.
Providence, Rhode Island  October 18, 2007
Once again, we delivered an excellent quarter with strong organic revenue growth and improved profitability, said Textron Chairman, President and CEO Lewis B. Campbell. Our sustained strong operating performance allowed us to exceed our financial targets while continuing to invest in our longer-term growth.
Third quarter 2007 revenue was $3.3 billion, up 15% from last year. Third quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was $0.95 per share, compared to $0.68 in the third quarter of 2006. Including discontinued operations, third quarter 2007 net income was $1.00 per share compared to $0.66 a year ago.
Year-to-date manufacturing cash flow from continuing operations was $654 million, resulting in free cash flow of $432 million.
2007 Outlook
Campbell added, We see strong end-market demand continuing through the rest of the decade, which in concert with the benefits of our ongoing Transformation strategy, positions us to deliver significant growth in earnings, cash flow and shareholder value.
Textron expects full-year 2007 revenues will be approximately $13 billion, up about 13.25% from last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to be between $3.40 and $3.50, approximately $0.22 per share higher than the companys previous target. The company now expects full-year 2007 free cash flow to be in the range of $600 - $650 million, up $50 million from its previous expectation.  The companys outlook does not include any impact of its announced plan to acquire United Industrial Corporation.
During the quarter, the company executed a two-for-one split of its common stock.  Textrons stock began trading on a post-split basis on August 27, 2007.
Note:
 
Third Quarter Segment Results
 
Bell
 
Bell segment revenues increased $121 million in the third quarter, while segment profit increased $34 million.
 
U.S. Government revenues increased $108 million due to higher volume and acquisitions. The volume increase reflects higher V-22, H-1, Intelligent Battlefield Systems, and Armored Security Vehicle (ASV) volumes, partially offset by lower volume of Joint Direct Attack Munitions and helicopter spares and services.
 
Third quarter profit in our U.S. Government business increased $24 million due to favorable performance, partially offset by inflation.  Improved performance reflected the impact of recovery during the quarter of previously unreimbursed Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter System Development and Demonstration costs incurred primarily in 2006, the impact of H-1 charges recorded in last years third quarter and favorable ASV performance.
 
Commercial revenues for the quarter increased $13 million due to higher pricing and acquisitions, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix of delivered helicopters and lower spares and service revenues.
 
In the third quarter commercial profit increased $10 million due to higher pricing, which was partially offset by inflation.
 
Backlog at Bell Helicopter reached $3.65 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of about $40 million from the end of the second quarter.
 
Cessna
 
Revenues at Cessna increased $218 million due to higher volume, primarily related to Citation business jets, and higher pricing.
 
Segment profit increased $60 million due to higher pricing and volume, partially offset by inflation and increased product development expenses.
 
Cessnas backlog hit another all-time high of $11.9 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2007, up $1.5 billion from the end of the second quarter.
 
Industrial
 
Industrial segment revenues increased $85 million due to higher volume, favorable foreign exchange and higher pricing.
Profit in the segment increased $18 million due to a gain on the sale of land, higher volumes and pricing, and improved cost performance, partially offset by inflation.
 
Finance
 
Revenues in the Finance segment increased $2 million primarily due to an increase in securitization and other fee income and higher average finance receivables. These increases were largely offset by the impact of a transaction in 2006 associated with a leveraged lease asset and market pricing pressures.
Profit in the Finance segment increased $1 million due to an increase in securitization and other fee income and a decrease in the provision for losses, partially offset by the impact of the 2006 leveraged lease transaction and higher operating expenses. The decrease in provision for losses is primarily attributable to lower growth in the receivable portfolio during the third quarter of 2007.
