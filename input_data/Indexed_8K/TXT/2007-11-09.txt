On November 8, 2007, Ted R. French, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Textron, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Textron stock options and sell the acquired Textron stock. This plan was established as part of his individual long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Textrons policies regarding stock transactions.
 
Under the plan, Mr. French may sell up to 135,366 shares of Textron stock over approximately seven months beginning in December 2007.  Shares will be sold under the plan on the open market at pre-determined times at prevailing market prices, subject to minimum price thresholds.The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time and avoid concerns about transactions occurring at a time when they might possess material non-public information.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
