WHEREAS, the Executive is presently employed by the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to employ the Executive and the Executive is willing to continue to be employed by the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to set forth the terms and conditions of such continued employment.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1.              Term of Employment
The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts continued employment, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, for a term (the "Employment Term") commencing on July 23, 1998 (the "Effective Date") and terminating, unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with Section 5 hereof, on the third anniversary of the Effective Date, provided that the Employment Term shall be automatically extended, subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 5 hereof, for successive additional one (1) year periods (the "Additional Terms"), unless, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then Additional Term, the Company or the Executive has notified the other in writing that the Employment Term shall terminate at the end of the then current term.
2.              Position and Responsibilities
During the Employment Term, the Executive shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or in such higher capacity as agreed by the Company and the Executive.  The Executive shall report exclusively to the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board").  The Executive shall, to the extent appointed or elected, serve on the Board as a director and as a member of any committee of the Board, in each case, without additional compensation.

The Executive shall have duties, authorities and responsibilities generally commensurate with the duties, authorities and responsibilities of persons in similar capacities in similarly sized companies subject to the By-laws of the Company.  The Executive shall devote substantially all of his business time, attention and energies to the performance of his duties hereunder, provided the foregoing will not prevent the Executive from participating in charitable, community or industry affairs, from managing his and his family's personal passive investments, and (with the consent of the Organization and Compensation Committee (or its successor) of the Board (the "O&C Committee"), which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) serving on the board of directors of other companies, provided that these activities do not materially interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder or create a potential business conflict or the appearance thereof.  The Company has consented to the Executive's services on the boards of directors, if any, on which the Executive currently serves, which boards the Executive has disclosed in writing to the O&C Committee.  The Executive may retain any compensation or benefits received as a result of consented to service as a director of entities not related to the Company.
3.           Compensation and Benefits
During the Employment Term, the Company shall pay and provide the Executive the following:
3.1  Base Salary.  The Company shall pay the Executive a base salary (the "Base Salary") in an amount which shall be established from time to time by the O&C Committee (or as otherwise designated by the Board), provided, however, that such base salary rate shall not be less than his current rate of base salary.  Base Salary shall be paid to the Executive in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices for executives.  Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually to ascertain whether, in the judgment of the reviewing committee, such Base Salary should be increased.  If so increased, Base Salary shall not be thereafter decreased and shall thereafter, as increased, be the Base Salary hereunder.
3.2  Annual Bonus.  The Company shall provide the Executive with the opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus under the Company's current annual incentive compensation plan for executives or a replacement plan therefor at a level commensurate with his position, provided that the minimum annual target award payable upon the achievement of reasonably attainable objective performance goals shall be at least seventy percent (70%) of Base Salary.
3.3  Long-Term Incentives.  The Company shall provide the Executive the opportunity to earn long-term incentive awards under the current equity and cash based plans and programs or replacements therefor at a level commensurate with the current aggregate opportunity being provided to the Executive.
3.4  Employee Benefits. The Executive shall, to the extent eligible, be entitled to participate at a level commensurate with his position in all employee benefit welfare and retirement plans and programs, as well as equity plans, generally provided by the Company to its senior executives in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect from time to time. Such plans and programs currently include, without limitation, the Amended and Restated Supplemental Retirement Plan for Textron Inc. Key Executives (the "SERP"), the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Key Executive Program (including the Deferred Income Plan, the Spillover Pension Plan, the Spillover Savings Plan, and the Survivor Benefit Plan), group term life insurance plan, comprehensive health, major medical, vision and dental insurance plans and short-term and long-term disability plans.
For purposes of determining the Executive's benefit under the SERP, the definition of "Compensation" under the SERP shall be revised as follows: (i) performance share units granted to the Executive after January 1, 2005 shall not be included in determining "Compensation"; and (ii) the amount of performance share units includible in "Compensation" attributable to performance share units accrued for the 2003-2005 and 2004-2006 performance cycles shall not, on average, exceed the amount that would be included if each cycle's payment was based on a share price appreciation of 10% since the closing share price on December 31, 2004 of $73.80 and financial and discretionary performance components combined to yield an earned performance share unit payout of 80%.
In addition, in lieu of the schedule provided in Section 2.03 of the SERP, the Executive's benefits under the SERP shall be based on the Executive's age in accordance with the following schedule:
3.5  Vacation.  The Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation in accordance with the standard written policies of the Company with regard to vacations of executives, but in no event less than four (4) weeks per calendar year.
3.6  Perquisites.  The Executive shall not be required to pay the cost of personal travel on Company aircraft by the Executive and members of the Executives immediate family (although the cost shall be imputed as income to the Executive to the extent required by applicable tax laws).  The Executive shall pay the cost (as reasonably determined by the Company) of any other person who travels with the Executive for non-business reasons.  To the extent legally permissible, the Company shall not treat perquisites provided to the Executive as income to the Executive.
3.7  Right to Change Plans.  The Company shall not be obligated by reason of this Section 3 to institute, maintain, or refrain from changing, amending, or discontinuing any benefit plan, program, or perquisite, so long as such changes are similarly applicable to executive employees generally.
3.8  Existing Awards.  The parties agree that the dividend-payment provision of the restricted stock awards granted on June 1, 1999, and January 1, 2001, shall be amended as provided in Exhibit B to ensure that the awards comply with Section 409A of the Code.
3.9     Performance Bonus.  The Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum cash payment equal to $2,500,000 (the "Performance Bonus") after satisfaction of the following: (i) the Executive's attainment of age sixty five (65) while employed by the Company or his earlier termination as a result of a termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason (a "Protected Termination"); (ii) earnings per share growth of the Company at a cumulative annual average of at least 10% over the three (3) year period commencing January 1, 2009 and ending December 31, 2011, as reported in the Company's audited financial statements (or, in the case of a Protected Termination, through the date of termination if after January 1, 2009, and without any requirement (but subject to pro-ration in accordance with the next paragraph as if the Executive's date of termination was his date of death) if before January 1, 2009); and (iii) if the Executive's employment terminated as a result of the Executive's voluntary retirement (other than for Good Reason) at or after age sixty five (65) and before January 1, 2012, the prior designation of a successor Chief Executive Officer.

If the Executive's employment is terminated before the Executives sixty-fifth (65) birthday as a result of his death or Disability, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum cash payment equal to the Performance Bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Executive was employed by the Company since May 1, 2005, and the denominator of which is the number of days between May 1, 2005 and the Executive's sixty-fifth (65) birthday.  If the Executives employment is terminated for death, the lump-sum payment shall be made ten (10) days after the Executives death.  If the Executives employment is terminated for Disability, the lump-sum payment shall be made ten (10) days after the earlier of (A) the end of the six-month period  following the Executives termination for Disability and (B) the date of the Executives death following his termination for Disability.

To the extent that any reimbursement under this paragraph would be includable in the Executives gross income for federal income tax purposes, the Executive shall submit the necessary documentation and shall receive the reimbursement no later than March 15 following the calendar year in which the expense is incurred.

The preceding sentence shall apply solely to determine the timing of payments under the Agreement in compliance with Section 409A.  The Agreement is not intended, and shall not be construed, to require that the Executive incur a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A before the Executive or the Company shall have grounds to terminate the Executives employment under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 5.

The Company shall maintain the coverage both during and, while potential liability exists, after the Employment Term.
11           Assignment
11.1           Assignment by the Company.  This Agreement may and shall be assigned or transferred to, and shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, any successor of the Company, and any such successor shall be deemed substituted for all purposes of the "Company" under the terms of this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, the term "successor" shall mean any person, firm, corporation or business entity which at any time, whether by merger, purchase, or otherwise, acquires all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

Except as herein provided, this Agreement may not otherwise be assigned by the Company.
11.2           Assignment by the Executive.  This Agreement is not assignable by the Executive.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, and administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.  If the Executive should die while any amounts payable to the Executive hereunder remain outstanding, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee or, in the absence of such designee, to the Executive's estate.
12           Legal Remedies
12.1           Payment of Legal Fees.  The Company shall pay the Executive's reasonable legal fees and costs associated with entering into this Agreement.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall promptly pay upon submission of statements all legal and other professional fees, costs of litigation, prejudgment interest, and other expenses incurred during the Executives lifetime or in the five-year period following the Executives death in connection with any dispute arising hereunder and/or in connection with any release of claims executed or to be executed in connection herewith; provided, however, the Company shall be reimbursed by the Executive for (i) the fees and expenses advanced in the event the Executive's claim is in a material manner in bad faith or frivolous and the arbitrator or court, as applicable, determines that the reimbursement of such fees and expenses is appropriate, or (ii) to the extent that the arbitrator or court, as appropriate, determines that such legal and other professional fees are clearly and demonstrably unreasonable.  Prejudgment interest shall be paid at the rate awarded by the arbitrator or court on any money award or judgment obtained by the Executive or by any person claiming by or through the Executive under this Agreement, payable at the same time as the underlying award or judgment is paid.  The only taxable payments or  reimbursements provided under this paragraph during the first six months following the Executives Qualifying Termination shall be reimbursements that the Executive could otherwise deduct as business expenses under Sections 162 or 167 of the Code (disregarding limitations based on adjusted gross income).  After the end of the sixth month following the Executives Qualifying Termination, taxable reimbursements shall be provided under this paragraph subject to the following requirements: (A) all reimbursements shall be provided pursuant to a written policy that provides an objectively determinable nondiscretionary description of the reimbursements provided; (B) all reimbursements shall be paid no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred; (C) no reimbursement shall be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) the amount of reimbursable expense incurred in one year shall not affect the amount of reimbursement available in another year.  Any taxable expenses incurred during the first six months following the Executives termination that are otherwise payable or reimbursable under this paragraph, but whose payment during the initial six-month period would result in additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, shall be paid or reimbursed in a lump sum, without interest, on the first regular payroll date after the end of the sixth month following the Executives Qualifying Termination.
12.2           Arbitration.  All disputes and controversies arising under or in connection with this Agreement, other than the seeking of injunctive or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 9 hereof, shall be settled by arbitration conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators sitting in New York City, New York, or such other location agreed by the parties hereto, in accordance with the rules for expedited resolution of commercial disputes of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The determination of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties.  Judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having proper jurisdiction. All expenses of such arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the counsel of the Executive, shall be borne by the Company and the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement of his expenses as provided in Section 12.1 hereof.
12.3           Notice.  Any notices, requests, demands, or other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if delivered personally, sent by telecopier, sent by an overnight service or sent by registered or certified mail.   Notice to the Executive not delivered personally (or by telecopy where the Executive is known to be) shall be sent to the last address on the books of the Company, and notice to the Company not delivered personally (or by telecopy to the known personal telecopy of the person it is being sent to) shall be sent to it at its principal office.  All notices to the Company shall be delivered to the Chairman of the O&C Committee with a copy to the senior legal officer.  Delivery shall be deemed to occur on the earlier of actual receipt or tender and rejection by the intended recipient.
12.4           Continued Payments.  In the event after a Change in Control either party files for arbitration to resolve any dispute as to whether a termination is for Cause or Good Reason, until such dispute is determined by the arbitrators, the Executive shall continue to be treated economically and benefit wise in the manner asserted by him in the arbitration effective as of the date of the filing of the arbitration, subject to the Executive promptly refunding any amounts paid to him, paying the cost of any benefits provided to him and paying to the Company the profits in any stock option or other equity awards exercised or otherwise realized by him during the pendency of the arbitration which he is ultimately held not to be entitled to; provided the arbitrators may terminate such payments and benefits in the event that they determine at any point that the Executive is intentionally delaying conclusion of the arbitration.
13           Miscellaneous
13.1           Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, except to the extent specifically provided otherwise herein, supersedes any prior agreements or understandings, oral or written, between the parties hereto or between the Executive and the Company, with respect to the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire Agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  To the extent any severance plan or program of the Company that would apply to the Executive is more generous to the Executive than the provisions hereof, the Executive shall be entitled to any additional payments or benefits which are not duplicative.
13.2           Modification.  This Agreement shall not be varied, altered, modified, canceled, changed, or in any way amended, nor any provision hereof waived, except by mutual agreement of the parties in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto or their legal representatives.
13.3           Severability.  In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect.
13.4           Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same Agreement.
13.5           Tax Withholding.  The Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city, or other taxes as may be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling.

14           Governing Law
The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of laws.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and the Company have executed this Agreement, as of the day and year first above written.
 
 
 
 
 
(a)           In the event that the Executive shall become entitled to payments and/or benefits provided by this Agreement or any other amounts in the "nature of compensation" (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a change of ownership or effective control covered by Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) as a result of such change in ownership or effective control (collectively the "Company Payments"), and such Company Payments will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (and any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed by any taxing authority) the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in subsection (d) below an additional amount (the "Gross-up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Company Payments and any U.S. federal, state, and for local income or payroll tax upon the Gross-up Payment provided for by this paragraph (a), but before deduction for any U.S. federal, state, and local income or payroll tax on the Company Payments, shall be equal to the Company Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments (calculated in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount (which shall be 2.99 times the Executives base amount within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code), then the Company shall not pay the Executive a Gross-up Payment, and the Company Payments (whether due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company) shall be reduced so that the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments equals the Safe Harbor Amount.  The reduction of the Company Payments, if applicable, shall be effected in the following order (unless the Executive elects another method of reduction by written notice to the Company prior to the Change in Control): (i) any cash severance benefits based on a multiple of Base Salary or annual incentive compensation; (ii) any other cash amounts payable to the Executive; (iii) any benefits valued as parachute payments; (iv) acceleration of vesting of any stock option for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying stock; and (v) acceleration of vesting of any equity award not covered by subsection (iv).
(b)           For purposes of determining whether any of the Company Payments and Gross-up Payments (collectively the "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (x) the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and except to the extent that, in the opinion of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to any change in ownership (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(2)) or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants") such Total Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments," represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the "base amount" or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (y) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
(c)           For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay U.S. federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of U.S. federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence for the calendar year in which the Company Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in U.S. federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes if paid in such year.  In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the prior Gross- up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and U.S. federal, state and local income tax imposed on the portion of the Gross-up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or a U.S. federal, state and local income tax deduction), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Gross-up Payment to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any U.S. federal, state and local tax authority, repayment thereof (and related amounts) shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to the Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed the interest received or credited to the Executive by such tax authority for the period it held such portion.  The Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expense thereof) if the Executive's claim for refund or credit is denied.
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountant or the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalties payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
(d)           The Gross-up Payment or portion thereof provided for in subsection (c) above shall be paid not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following an event occurring which subjects the Executive to the Excise Tax; provided, however, that if the amount of such Gross-up Payment or portion thereof cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Accountant, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code), subject to further payments pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, as soon as the amount thereof can reasonably be determined, but in no event later than the ninetieth day after the occurrence of the event subjecting the Executive to the Excise Tax.  In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, the Company shall promptly notify the Executive of the excess payment, and the Executive shall repay the excess amount to the Company within fifteen days after the Executive receives the notice (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).
(e)           In the event of any controversy with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with regard to the Excise Tax, the Executive shall permit the Company to control issues related to the Excise Tax (at its expense), provided that such issues do not potentially materially adversely affect the Executive, but the Executive shall control any other issues.  In the event the issues are interrelated, the Executive and the Company shall in good faith cooperate so as not to jeopardize resolution of either issue, but if the parties cannot agree the Executive shall make the final determination with regard to the issues.  In the event of any conference with any taxing authority as to the Excise Tax or associated income taxes, the Executive shall permit the representative of the Company to accompany the Executive, and the Executive and the Executive's representative shall cooperate with the Company and its representative.
(f)           The Company shall be responsible for all charges of the Accountant.
(g)           The Company and the Executive shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any verbal communications, with any taxing authority regarding the Excise Tax covered by this Exhibit A.
 
 
 
To the extent that the restricted stock awards granted to the Executive on June 1, 1999, and January 1, 2001, as subsequently amended, have not vested or been forfeited before February 26, 2008, the provisions of each the restricted stock award governing the payment of dividends shall be amended as follows, effective as of February 26, 2008:
Dividends shall be credited to the Executive and such dividends shall be accounted for as if reinvested in actual Textron common stock (although no funds shall be set aside or shares purchased for the Executive, and the obligation to pay the dividends to the Executive shall be an unfunded obligation of the Company).  Such dividends shall vest immediately.  Payment of the dividends shall be made in a lump sum in cash within 30 days after the earliest of the following dates, if the Executive is still employed by the Company on the applicable date: (1) the fixed date on which the underlying shares of restricted stock are scheduled to vest; (2) the date of the Executives death; and (3) the date on which the Executive incurs a Disability, as defined in the restricted stock agreement, that also qualifies as a disability for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.  If the Executives separation from service with the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code) occurs before the payment date identified in the preceding sentence, the dividends shall be paid in a lump sum in cash on the earlier of the following dates: (1) on the first regular payroll date after the date of the Executives death following his separation from service, and (2) on the first regular payroll date after the end of the sixth month following the Executives separation from service.

This Agreement may and shall be assigned or transferred to, and shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, any successor of the Company, and any such successor shall be deemed substituted for all purposes of the "Company" under the terms of this Agreement.

Payment of Legal Fees.  The Company shall pay the Executive's reasonable legal fees and costs associated with entering into this Agreement.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall promptly pay upon submission of statements all legal and other professional fees, costs of litigation, prejudgment interest, and other expenses incurred during the Executives lifetime or in the five-year period following the Executives death in connection with any dispute arising hereunder and/or in connection with any release of claims executed or to be executed in connection herewith; provided, however, the Company shall be reimbursed by the Executive for (i) the fees and expenses advanced in the event the Executive's claim is in a material manner in bad faith or frivolous and the arbitrator or court, as applicable, determines that the reimbursement of such fees and expenses is appropriate, or (ii) to the extent that the arbitrator or court, as appropriate, determines that such legal and other professional fees are clearly and demonstrably unreasonable.  Prejudgment interest shall be paid at the rate awarded by the arbitrator or court on any money award or judgment obtained by the Executive or by any person claiming by or through the Executive under this Agreement, payable at the same time as the underlying award or judgment is paid.  The only taxable payments or reimbursements provided under this paragraph during the first six months following the Executives Qualifying Termination shall be reimbursements that the Executive could otherwise deduct as business expenses under Sections 162 or 167 of the Code (disregarding limitations based on adjusted gross income).  After the end of the sixth month following the Executives Qualifying Termination, taxable reimbursements shall be provided under this paragraph subject to the following requirements: (A) all reimbursements shall be provided pursuant to a written policy that provides an objectively determinable nondiscretionary description of the reimbursements provided; (B) all reimbursements shall be paid no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred; (C) no reimbursement shall be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) the amount of reimbursable expense incurred in one year shall not affect the amount of reimbursement available in another year.  Any taxable expenses incurred during the first six months following the Executives termination that are otherwise payable or reimbursable under this paragraph, but whose payment during the initial six-month period would result in additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, shall be paid or reimbursed in a lump sum, without interest, on the first regular payroll date after the end of the sixth month following the Executives Qualifying Termination.
 
12.2
 
Arbitration.  All disputes and controversies arising under or in connection with this Agreement, other than the seeking of injunctive or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 9 hereof, shall be settled by arbitration conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators sitting in New York City, New York, or such other location agreed by the parties hereto, in accordance with the rules for expedited resolution of commercial disputes of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  The determination of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties.  Judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having proper jurisdiction.  All expenses of such arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the counsel of the Executive, shall be borne by the Company and the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement of his expenses as provided in Section 12.1 hereof.
 
12.3
 
Notice.  Any notices, requests, demands, or other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if delivered personally, sent by telecopier, sent by an overnight service or sent by registered or certified mail.

All notices to the Company shall be delivered to the Chief Executive Officer with a copy to the senior legal officer.  Delivery shall be deemed to occur on the earlier of actual receipt or tender and rejection by the intended recipient.
 
12.4
 
Continued Payments.  In the event after a Change in Control either party files for arbitration to resolve any dispute as to whether a termination is for Cause or Good Reason, until such dispute is determined by the arbitrators, the Executive shall continue to be treated economically and benefit wise in the manner asserted by him in the arbitration effective as of the date of the filing of the arbitration, subject to the Executive promptly refunding any amounts paid to him, paying the cost of any benefits provided to him and paying to the Company the profits in any stock option or other equity awards exercised or otherwise realized by him during the pendency of the arbitration which he is ultimately held not to be entitled to; provided the arbitrators may terminate such payments and benefits in the event that they determine at any point that the Executive is intentionally delaying conclusion of the arbitration.

THIS SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, is entered into as of this 26th day of February, 2008, by and between Textron Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation having its principal office at 40 Westminster Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02903 and John D. Butler (the "Executive").
 
 
WHEREAS, the Executive is presently employed by the Company;
 
WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to employ the Executive and the Executive is willing to continue to be employed by the Company;
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive entered into an employment agreement as of July 23, 1998;
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive entered into an amended and restated employment agreement as of May 4, 2006; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to set forth the terms and conditions of such continued employment in this Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Agreement").
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts continued employment, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, for a term (the "Employment Term") commencing on July 23, 1998 (the "Effective Date") and terminating, unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with Section 5 hereof, on the third anniversary of the Effective Date, provided that the Employment Term shall be automatically extended, subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 5 hereof, for successive additional one (1) year periods (the "Additional Terms"), unless, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then Additional Term, the Company or the Executive has notified the other in writing that the Employment Term shall terminate at the end of the then current term.
 
 
During the Employment Term, the Executive shall serve as the Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer of the Company or in such higher capacity as agreed by the Company and the Executive.  The Executive shall report exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board").  The Executive shall, to the extent appointed or elected, serve on the Board as a director and as a member of any committee of the Board, in each case, without additional compensation.  The Executive shall, to the extent appointed or elected, serve as a director or as a member of any committee of the board (or the equivalent bodies in a non-corporate subsidiary or affiliate) of any of the Company's subsidiaries or affiliates and as an officer or employee (in a capacity commensurate with his position with the Company) of any such subsidiaries or affiliates, in all cases, without additional compensation or benefits and any compensation paid to the Executive, or benefits provided to the Executive, in such capacities shall be a credit with regard to the amounts due hereunder from the Company.  The Executive shall have duties, authorities and responsibilities generally commensurate with the duties, authorities and responsibilities of persons in similar capacities in similarly sized companies subject to the By-laws of the Company and the organizational structure of the Company.  The Executive shall devote substantially all of his business time, attention and energies to the performance of his duties hereunder, provided the foregoing will not prevent the Executive from participating in charitable, community or industry affairs, from managing his and his family's personal passive investments, and (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer or the Organization and Compensation Committee (or its successor) of the Board (the "O&C Committee"), which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) serving on the board of directors of other companies, provided that these activities do not materially interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder or create a potential business conflict or the appearance thereof.  The Company has consented to the Executive's services on the boards of directors, if any, on which the Executive currently serves, which boards the Executive has disclosed in writing to the O&C Committee.  The Executive may retain any compensation or benefits received as a result of consented to service as a director of entities not related to the Company.
 
 
During the Employment Term, the Company shall pay and provide the Executive the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Upon submission of appropriate documentation, in accordance with its policies in effect from time to time, the Company shall pay, or reimburse, the Executive for all ordinary and necessary expenses, in a reasonable amount, which the Executive incurs during the Employment Term in performing his duties under this Agreement including, but not limited to, travel, entertainment, and professional dues and subscriptions.  To the extent that any reimbursement under this paragraph would be includable in the Executives gross income for federal income tax purposes, the Executive shall submit the necessary documentation and shall receive the reimbursement no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the expense is incurred.
 
 
The Executive's employment with the Company (including but not limited to any subsidiary or affiliate or the Company) and the Employment Term shall terminate upon the occurrence of the first of the following events:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To the extent that any payment would be made or any benefit would be provided under this Agreement as a result of the Executives termination of employment under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 5, the payment or benefit shall be provided only if the Executive has also incurred a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and any timing requirements associated with the payment or benefit (such as, for example, a requirement that a payment be delayed for six months following the Executives termination) shall be applied in relation to the date on which the separation from service occurs for purposes of Section 409A.  The preceding sentence shall apply solely to determine the timing of payments under the Agreement in compliance with Section 409A.  The Agreement is not intended, and shall not be construed, to require that the Executive incur a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A before the Executive or the Company shall have grounds to terminate the Executives employment under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 5.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Section 409A Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred as of the first day any one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d), above, has been satisfied, if the event also constitutes a change in ownership, change in effective control, or change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Companys assets as defined in regulations or other guidance under Section 409A of the Code.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company shall cover the Executive under directors and officers liability insurance for bona fide (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(10)) claims based on the Executives actions or failure to act in his capacity as a director,  officer, employee, or fiduciary of the Company in the same amount and to the same extent, if any, as the Company covers its other officers and directors.  The Company shall maintain the coverage both during and, while potential liability exists, after the Employment Term.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of laws.
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and the Company have executed this Agreement, as of the day and year first above written.

(a)
 
In the event that the Executive shall become entitled to payments and/or benefits provided by this Agreement or any other amounts in the "nature of compensation" (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a change of ownership or effective control covered by Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) as a result of such change in ownership or effective control (collectively the "Company Payments"), and such Company Payments will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (and any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed by any taxing authority) the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in subsection (d) below an additional amount (the "Gross-up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Company Payments and any U.S. federal, state, and for local income or payroll tax upon the Gross-up Payment provided for by this paragraph (a), but before deduction for any U.S. federal, state, and local income or payroll tax on the Company Payments, shall be equal to the Company Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments (calculated in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount (which shall be 2.99 times the Executives base amount within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code), then the Company shall not pay the Executive a Gross-up Payment, and the Company Payments (whether due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company) shall be reduced so that the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments equals the Safe Harbor Amount.  The reduction of the Company Payments, if applicable, shall be effected in the following order (unless the Executive elects another method of reduction by written notice to the Company prior to the Change in Control): (i) any cash severance benefits based on a multiple of Base Salary or annual incentive compensation; (ii) any other cash amounts payable to the Executive; (iii) any benefits valued as parachute payments; (iv) acceleration of vesting of any stock option for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying stock; and (v) acceleration of vesting of any equity award not covered by subsection (iv)..

For purposes of determining whether any of the Company Payments and Gross-up Payments (collectively the "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (x) the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and except to the extent that, in the opinion of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to any change in ownership (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(2)) or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants") such Total Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments," represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the "base amount" or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (y) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
 
(c)
 
For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay U.S. federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of U.S. federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence for the calendar year in which the Company Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in U.S. federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes if paid in such year.  In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the prior Gross-up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and U.S. federal, state and local income tax imposed on the portion of the Gross-up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or a U.S. federal, state and local income tax deduction), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Gross-up Payment to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any U.S. federal, state and local tax authority, repayment thereof (and related amounts) shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to the Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed the interest received or credited to the Executive by such tax authority for the period it held such portion.  The Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expense thereof) if the Executive's claim for refund or credit is denied.
 
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountant or the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalties payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
 
(d)
 
The Gross-up Payment or portion thereof provided for in subsection (c) above shall be paid not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following an event occurring which subjects the Executive to the Excise Tax; provided, however, that if the amount of such Gross-up Payment or portion thereof cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Accountant, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code), subject to further payments pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, as soon as the amount thereof can reasonably be determined, but in no event later than the ninetieth day after the occurrence of the event subjecting the Executive to the Excise Tax.  In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, the Company shall promptly notify the Executive of the excess payment, and the Executive shall repay the excess amount to the Company within fifteen days after the Executive receives the notice (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).
 
(e)
 
In the event of any controversy with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with regard to the Excise Tax, the Executive shall permit the Company to control issues related to the Excise Tax (at its expense), provided that such issues do not potentially materially adversely affect the Executive, but the Executive shall control any other issues.  In the event the issues are interrelated, the Executive and the Company shall in good faith cooperate so as not to jeopardize resolution of either issue, but if the parties cannot agree the Executive shall make the final determination with regard to the issues.  In the event of any conference with any taxing authority as to the Excise Tax or associated income taxes, the Executive shall permit the representative of the Company to accompany the Executive, and the Executive and the Executive's representative shall cooperate with the Company and its representative.
 
(f)
 
The Company shall be responsible for all charges of the Accountant.
 
(g)
 
The Company and the Executive shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any verbal communications, with any taxing authority regarding the Excise Tax covered by this Exhibit A.

THIS SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, is entered into as of this 26th day of February, 2008, by and between Textron Inc.

WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to set forth the terms and conditions of such continued employment in this Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Agreement").
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts continued employment, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, for a term (the "Employment Term") commencing on July 23, 1998, (the "Effective Date") and terminating, unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with Section 5 hereof, on the third anniversary of the Effective Date, provided that the Employment Term shall be automatically extended, subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 5 hereof, for successive additional one (1) year periods (the "Additional Terms"), unless, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then Additional Term, the Company or the Executive has notified the other in writing that the Employment Term shall terminate at the end of the then current term.
 
 
During the Employment Term, the Executive shall serve as the Executive Vice President - Government and International of the Company or in such higher capacity as agreed by the Company and the Executive.  The Executive shall report exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board").  The Executive shall, to the extent appointed or elected, serve on the Board as a director and as a member of any committee of the Board, in each case, without additional compensation.  The Executive shall, to the extent appointed or elected, serve as a director or as a member of any committee of the board (or the equivalent bodies in a non-corporate subsidiary or affiliate) of any of the Company's subsidiaries or affiliates and as an officer or employee (in a capacity commensurate with her position with the Company) of any such subsidiaries or affiliates, in all cases, without additional compensation or benefits and any compensation paid to the Executive, or benefits provided to the Executive, in such capacities shall be a credit with regard to the amounts due hereunder from the Company.  The Executive shall have duties, authorities and responsibilities generally commensurate with the duties, authorities and responsibilities of persons in similar capacities in similarly sized companies subject to the By-laws of the Company and the organizational structure of the Company.  The Executive shall devote substantially all of her business time, attention and energies to the performance of her duties hereunder, provided the foregoing will not prevent the Executive from participating in charitable, community or industry affairs, from managing her and her family's personal passive investments, and (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer or the Organization and Compensation Committee (or its successor) of the Board (the "O&C Committee"), which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) serving on the board of directors of other companies, provided that these activities do not materially interfere with the performance of her duties hereunder or create a potential business conflict or the appearance thereof.  The Company has consented to the Executive's services on the boards of directors, if any, on which the Executive currently serves, which boards the Executive has disclosed in writing to the O&C Committee.
 
The Executive may retain any compensation or benefits received as a result of consented to service as a director of entities not related to the Company.
 
 
During the Employment Term, the Company shall pay and provide the Executive the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Upon submission of appropriate documentation, in accordance with its policies in effect from time to time, the Company shall pay, or reimburse, the Executive for all ordinary and necessary expenses, in a reasonable amount, which the Executive incurs during the Employment Term in performing her duties under this Agreement including, but not limited to, travel, entertainment, and professional dues and subscriptions.

The Executive's employment with the Company (including but not limited to any subsidiary or affiliate or the Company) and the Employment Term shall terminate upon the occurrence of the first of the following events:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To the extent that any payment would be made or any benefit would be provided under this Agreement as a result of the Executives termination of employment under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 5, the payment or benefit shall be provided only if the Executive has also incurred a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and any timing requirements associated with the payment or benefit (such as, for example, a requirement that a payment be delayed for six months following the Executives termination) shall be applied in relation to the date on which the separation from service occurs for purposes of Section 409A.  The preceding sentence shall apply solely to determine the timing of payments under the Agreement in compliance with Section 409A.  The Agreement is not intended, and shall not be construed, to require that the Executive incur a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A before the Executive or the Company shall have grounds to terminate the Executives employment under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 5.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Section 409A Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred as of the first day any one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d), above, has been satisfied, if the event also constitutes a change in ownership, change in effective control, or change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Companys assets as defined in regulations or other guidance under Section 409A of the Code.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company shall cover the Executive under directors and officers liability insurance for bona fide (within the meaning of Treas.  Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(10)) claims based on the Executives actions or failure to act in his capacity as a director, officer, employee, or fiduciary of the Company in the same amount and to the same extent, if any, as the Company covers its other officers and directors.  The Company shall maintain the coverage both during and, while potential liability exists, after the Employment Term.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of laws.

(a)
 
In the event that the Executive shall become entitled to payments and/or benefits provided by this Agreement or any other amounts in the "nature of compensation" (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a change of ownership or effective control covered by Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) as a result of such change in ownership or effective control (collectively the "Company Payments"), and such Company Payments will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (and any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed by any taxing authority) the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in subsection (d) below an additional amount (the "Gross-up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Company Payments and any U.S.  federal, state, and for local income or payroll tax upon the Gross-up Payment provided for by this paragraph (a), but before deduction for any U.S.  federal, state, and local income or payroll tax on the Company Payments, shall be equal to the Company Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments (calculated in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount (which shall be 2.99 times the Executives base amount within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code), then the Company shall not pay the Executive a Gross-up Payment, and the Company Payments (whether due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company) shall be reduced so that the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments equals the Safe Harbor Amount.  The reduction of the Company Payments, if applicable, shall be effected in the following order (unless the Executive elects another method of reduction by written notice to the Company prior to the Change in Control): (i) any cash severance benefits based on a multiple of Base Salary or annual incentive compensation; (ii) any other cash amounts payable to the Executive; (iii) any benefits valued as parachute payments; (iv) acceleration of vesting of any stock option for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying stock; and (v) acceleration of vesting of any equity award not covered by subsection (iv).
 
(b)
 
For purposes of determining whether any of the Company Payments and Gross-up Payments (collectively the "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (x) the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and except to the extent that, in the opinion of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to any change in ownership (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(2)) or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants") such Total Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments," represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the "base amount" or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (y) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
 
(c)
 
For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay U.S.  federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of U.S.  federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence for the calendar year in which the Company Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in U.S.  federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes if paid in such year.  In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the prior Gross-up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and U.S.  federal, state and local income tax imposed on the portion of the Gross-up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or a U.S.  federal, state and local income tax deduction), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Gross-up Payment to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any U.S.  federal, state and local tax authority, repayment thereof (and related amounts) shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to the Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed the interest received or credited to the Executive by such tax authority for the period it held such portion.  The Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expense thereof) if the Executive's claim for refund or credit is denied.  In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountant or the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalties payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
 
(d)
 
The Gross-up Payment or portion thereof provided for in subsection (c) above shall be paid not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following an event occurring which subjects the Executive to the Excise Tax; provided, however, that if the amount of such Gross-up Payment or portion thereof cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Accountant, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code), subject to further payments pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, as soon as the amount thereof can reasonably be determined, but in no event later than the ninetieth day after the occurrence of the event subjecting the Executive to the Excise Tax.  In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, the Company shall promptly notify the Executive of the excess payment, and the Executive shall repay the excess amount to the Company within fifteen days after the Executive receives the notice (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).
 
(e)
 
In the event of any controversy with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with regard to the Excise Tax, the Executive shall permit the Company to control issues related to the Excise Tax (at its expense), provided that such issues do not potentially materially adversely affect the Executive, but the Executive shall control any other issues.  In the event the issues are interrelated, the Executive and the Company shall in good faith cooperate so as not to jeopardize resolution of either issue, but if the parties cannot agree the Executive shall make the final determination with regard to the issues.  In the event of any conference with any taxing authority as to the Excise Tax or associated income taxes, the Executive shall permit the representative of the Company to accompany the Executive, and the Executive and the Executive's representative shall cooperate with the Company and its representative.
 
(f)
 
The Company shall be responsible for all charges of the Accountant.

The Company and the Executive shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any verbal communications, with any taxing authority regarding the Excise Tax covered by this Exhibit A.

WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive entered into an amended and restated employment agreement as of May 4, 2006; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to set forth the terms and conditions of such continued employment in this Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Agreement").
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
 
The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts such continued employment, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, for a term (the "Employment Term") that commenced on March 10, 2000 (the "Effective Date") and terminating, unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with Section 5 hereof, on the next anniversary of March 10, 2008, provided that the Employment Term shall be automatically extended, subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 5 hereof, for successive additional one (1) year periods (the "Additional Terms"), unless, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then Additional Term, the Company or the Executive has notified the other in writing that the Employment Term shall terminate at the end of the then current term.
 
 
 
During the Employment Term, the Executive shall serve as the Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company or in such higher capacity as agreed by the Company and the Executive. The Executive shall also serve as a member of the Management Committee (or any equivalent committee or group as may replace the Management Committee from time to time). The Executive shall report exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"). The Executive shall, to the extent appointed or elected, serve on the Board as a director and as a member of any committee of the Board, in each case, without additional compensation.

The Executive shall have duties, authorities and responsibilities generally commensurate with the duties, authorities and responsibilities of persons in similar capacities in similarly sized companies, subject to the By-laws of the Company and the organizational structure of the Company. Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, the Executive shall devote substantially all of his business time, attention and energies to the performance of his duties hereunder, provided the foregoing will not prevent the Executive from participating in charitable, community or industry affairs, from managing his and his family's personal passive investments, and (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer or the Organization and Compensation Committee (or its successor) of the Board (the "O&C Committee"), which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) serving on the board of directors of other companies, provided that these activities do not materially interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder or create a potential business conflict or the appearance thereof. In particular, Executive (a) may continue to serve as a part-time partner at Williams & Connolly LLP, and (b) may serve on the board of directors of each of (i) The Gerald R. Ford Foundation, (ii) the Air Force Academy Falcon Foundation, (iii) IGI, Inc. and (iv) ePlus, Inc., in each case retaining any compensation or emoluments therefrom.

Base Salary shall be paid to the Executive in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices for executives. Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually by the O&C Committee (or as otherwise designated by the Board) to ascertain whether, in the judgment of the reviewing committee, such Base Salary should be increased. If so increased, Base Salary shall not be thereafter decreased and shall thereafter, as increased, be the Base Salary hereunder.
 
3.2
 
Annual Bonus. The Company shall provide the Executive with the opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus under the Company's current annual incentive compensation plan for executives or a replacement plan therefor at a level commensurate with his position, provided that the minimum annual target award payable upon the achievement of reasonably attainable objective performance goals shall be at least 55% of Base Salary.
 
3.3
 
Long-Term Incentives. The Company shall provide the Executive the opportunity to earn long-term incentive awards under the current equity and cash based plans and programs or replacements therefor.
 
3.4
 
Employee Benefits. The Executive shall, to the extent eligible, be entitled to participate at a level commensurate with his position in all employee benefit welfare and retirement plans and programs, as well as equity plans, generally provided by the Company to its senior executives in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect from time to time. Such plans and programs currently include, without limitation, the Amended and Restated Supplemental Retirement Plan for Textron Inc. Key Executives (the "SERP"), the 2007Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Key Executive Program (including the Deferred Income Plan, the Spillover Pension Plan, the Spillover Savings Plan and the Survivor Benefit Plan), group term life insurance plan, comprehensive health, major medical, vision and dental insurance plans and short-term and long-term disability plans.

The Executive shall not be required to pay the cost of personal travel on Company aircraft by the Executive and members of the Executives immediate family (although the cost shall be imputed as income to the Executive to the extent required by applicable tax laws).  The Executive shall pay the cost (as reasonably determined by the Company) of any other person who travels with the Executive for non-business reasons.  To the extent legally permissible, the Company shall not treat perquisites provided to the Executive as income to the Executive.
 
3.7
 
Right to Change Plans. The Company shall not be obligated by reason of this Section 3 to institute, maintain, or refrain from changing, amending, or discontinuing any benefit plan, program, or perquisite, so long as such changes are similarly applicable to executive employees generally.

Special Provisions. The Company shall provide to the Executive the special provisions set forth on Amended and Restated Exhibit B hereto, which Amended and Restated Exhibit B is incorporated herein.
 
 
 
Upon submission of appropriate documentation, in accordance with its policies in effect from time to time, the Company shall pay, or reimburse, the Executive for all ordinary and necessary expenses, in a reasonable amount, which the Executive incurs during the Employment Term in performing his duties under this Agreement including, but not limited to, travel, entertainment, and professional dues and subscriptions.  To the extent that any reimbursement under this paragraph would be includable in the Executives gross income for federal income tax purposes, the Executive shall submit the necessary documentation and shall receive the reimbursement no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the expense is incurred.
 
 
 
The Executive's employment with the Company (including but not limited to any subsidiary or affiliate or the Company) and the Employment Term shall terminate upon the occurrence of the first of the following events:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To the extent that any payment would be made or any benefit would be provided under this Agreement as a result of the Executives termination of employment under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 5, the payment or benefit shall be provided only if the Executive has also incurred a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and any timing requirements associated with the payment or benefit (such as, for example, a requirement that a payment be delayed for six months following the Executives termination) shall be applied in relation to the date on which the separation from service occurs for purposes of Section 409A.  The preceding sentence shall apply solely to determine the timing of payments under the Agreement in compliance with Section 409A.  The Agreement is not intended, and shall not be construed, to require that the Executive incur a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A before the Executive or the Company shall have grounds to terminate the Executives employment under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this Section 5.
 
 
 
6.1
 
Termination Due to Death or Retirement. If the Employment Term ends on account of the Executive's termination due to death pursuant to Section 5(a) above or retirement pursuant to Section 5(c) above, the Executive (or the Executive's surviving spouse, or other beneficiary as so designated by the Executive during his lifetime, or to the Executive's estate, as appropriate) shall be entitled, in lieu of any other payments or benefits, to (i) payment promptly of any unpaid Base Salary, unpaid annual incentive compensation (for the preceding fiscal year) and any accrued vacation, (ii) reimbursement for any unreimbursed business expenses incurred prior to the date of termination, and (iii) any amounts, benefits or fringes due under any equity, benefit or fringe plan, grant or program in accordance with the terms of said plan, grant or program but without duplication (collectively, the "Accrued Obligations").  The Accrued Obligations described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be paid on the first regular payroll date after the Executives termination (or, if earlier, 45 days after the Executives termination).
 
6.2
 
Termination Due to Disability. If the Employment Term ends as a result of Disability pursuant to Section 5(b) above, the Executive shall be entitled, in lieu of any other payments or benefits (but subject to the last sentence of such Section 5(b)), to any Accrued Obligations.
 
6.3
 
Involuntary Termination by the Company Without Cause or Termination by the Executive for Good Reason. If the Executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause in accordance with Section 5(e) above or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason in accordance with Section 5(f) above, the Executive shall be entitled, in lieu of any other payments or benefits, subject to Section 7(b) hereof, to any Accrued Obligations and the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.4
 
Termination by the Company for Cause or Termination by the Executive without Good Reason. If the Executive is terminated by the Company for Cause or the Executive terminates his employment without Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to receive all Accrued Obligations.
 
6.5
 
Coordination With Other Plans.  The rules set forth in this Section 6.5 shall apply to all amounts provided under the Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.6
 
The Executives right under this Section 6 to receive any payments in installments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, as provided in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.1

8.3
 
Definition of "Change in Control." A Change in Control of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred as of the first day any one or more of the following conditions shall have been satisfied:
 
 
 
 
 
A Section 409A Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred as of the first day any one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d), above, has been satisfied, if the event also constitutes a change in ownership, change in effective control, or change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Companys assets as defined in regulations or other guidance under Section 409A of the Code.
 
8.4
 
Excise Tax Equalization Payment. In the event that the Executive becomes entitled to payments and/or benefits which would constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, the provisions of Exhibit A will apply.
 
8.5
 
The Executives right under this Section 8 to receive any payments in installments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, as provided in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii).

If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 9, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.
 
9.6
 
Remedies.
 
 
 
 
9.7
 
Uniformity. In no event shall any definitions of Competition or Solicitation (or a similar provision) as it applies to the Executive with regard to any plan of program or grant of the Company be interpreted to be any broader than as set forth in this Section 9.
 
9.8
 
Delivery of Documents. Upon termination of this Agreement or at any other time upon request by the Company, the Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company all records, files, memoranda, notes, designs, data, reports, price lists, customer lists, drawings, plans, computer programs, software, software documentation, sketches, laboratory and research notebooks and other documents (and all copies or reproductions of such materials in his possession or control) belonging to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may retain his rolodex and similar phone directories (collectively, the "Rolodex") to the extent the Rolodex does not contain information other than name, address, telephone number and similar information, provided that, at the request of the Company, the Executive shall provide the Company with a copy of the Rolodex.

Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(10)) claims based on the Executives actions or failure to act in his capacity as a director, officer, employee, or fiduciary of the Company in the same amount and to the same extent, if any, as the Company covers its then current officers and directors.  The Company shall maintain the coverage both during and, while potential liability exists, after the Employment Term.
 
 
 
11.1
 
Assignment by the Company. This Agreement may and shall be assigned or transferred to, and shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, any successor of the Company, and any such successor shall be deemed substituted for all purposes of the "Company" under the terms of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "successor" shall mean any person, firm, corporation or business entity which at any time, whether by merger, purchase, or otherwise, acquires all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. Notwithstanding such assignment, the Company shall remain, with such successor, jointly and severally liable for all its obligations hereunder. Except as herein provided, this Agreement may not otherwise be assigned by the Company.
 
11.2
 
Assignment by the Executive. This Agreement is not assignable by the Executive. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, and administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive should die while any amounts payable to the Executive hereunder remain outstanding, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee or, in the absence of such designee, to the Executive's estate.
 
 
 
12.1
 
Payment of Legal Fees. The Company shall pay the Executive's reasonable legal fees and costs associated with entering into this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall promptly pay upon submission of statements all legal and other professional fees, costs of litigation, prejudgment interest, and other expenses incurred during the Executives lifetime or in the five-year period following the Executives death in connection with any dispute arising hereunder and/or in connection with any release of claims executed or to be executed in connection herewith; provided, however, the Company shall be reimbursed by the Executive for (i) the fees and expenses advanced in the event the Executive's claim is in a material manner in bad faith or frivolous and the arbitrator or court, as applicable, determines that the reimbursement of such fees and expenses is appropriate, or (ii) to the extent that the arbitrator or court, as appropriate, determines that such legal and other professional fees are clearly and demonstrably unreasonable.  Prejudgment interest shall be paid at the rate awarded by the arbitrator or courton any money award or judgment obtained by the Executive or by any person claiming by or through the Executive, payable at the same time as the underlying award or judgment is paid.  The only taxable payments or reimbursements provided under this paragraph during the first six months following the Executives Qualifying Termination shall be reimbursements that the Executive could otherwise deduct as business expenses under Sections 162 or 167 of the Code (disregarding limitations based on adjusted gross income).  After the end of the sixth month following the Executives Qualifying Termination, taxable reimbursements shall be provided under this paragraph subject to the following requirements: (A) all reimbursements shall be provided pursuant to a written policy that provides an objectively determinable nondiscretionary description of the reimbursements provided; (B) all reimbursements shall be paid no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred; (C) no reimbursement shall be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) the amount of reimbursable expense incurred in one year shall not affect the amount of reimbursement available in another year.  Any taxable expenses incurred during the first six months following the Executives termination that are otherwise payable or reimbursable under this paragraph, but whose payment during the initial six-month period would result in additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, shall be paid or reimbursed in a lump sum, without interest, on the first regular payroll date after the end of the sixth month following the Executives Qualifying Termination.
 
 
12.2
 
Arbitration. All disputes and controversies arising under or in connection with this Agreement, other than the seeking of injunctive or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 9 hereof, shall be settled by arbitration conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators sitting in New York City, New York, or such other location agreed by the parties hereto, in accordance with the rules for expedited resolution of commercial disputes of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The determination of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having proper jurisdiction. All expenses of such arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the counsel of the Executive, shall be borne by the Company and the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement of his expenses as provided in Section 12.1 hereof.
 
12.3
 
Notice. Any notices, requests, demands, or other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if delivered personally, sent by telecopier, sent by an overnight service or sent by registered or certified mail. Notice to the Executive not delivered personally (or by telecopy where the Executive is known to be) shall be sent to the last address on the books of the Company, and notice to the Company not delivered personally (or by telecopy to the known personal telecopy of the person it is being sent to) shall be sent to it at its principal office. All notices to the Company shall be delivered to the Chief Executive Officer with a copy (not itself constituting notice) to the Executive Vice President, Human Relations. A copy (not itself constituting notice) of any notice to the Executive shall be delivered to Jerry L. Shulman, Williams & Connolly LLP, 725 12th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Delivery shall be deemed to occur on the earlier of actual receipt or tender and rejection by the intended recipient.
 
12.4
 
Continued Payments. In the event after a Change in Control either party files for arbitration to resolve any dispute as to whether a termination is for Cause or Good Reason, until such dispute is determined by the arbitrators, the Executive shall continue to be treated economically and benefit wise in the manner asserted by him in the arbitration effective as of the date of the filing of the arbitration, subject to the Executive's promptly refunding any amounts paid to him, paying the cost of any benefits provided to him and paying to the Company the profits in any stock option or other equity awards exercised or otherwise realized by him during the pendency of the arbitration which he is ultimately held not to be entitled to; provided the arbitrators may terminate such payments and benefits in the event that they determine at any point that the Executive is intentionally delaying conclusion of the arbitration.
 
 
 
13.1
 
Entire Agreement. This Agreement and each Exhibit hereto, except to the extent specifically provided otherwise herein or therein, supersedes any prior agreements or understandings, oral or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any discrepancy or conflict between this Agreement and either Exhibit, the provisions of the Exhibit shall prevail. To the extent any severance plan or program of the Company that would apply to the Executive is more generous to the Executive than the provisions hereof, the Executive shall be entitled to any additional payments or benefits that are not duplicative.
 
13.2
 
Modification. This Agreement shall not be varied, altered, modified, canceled, changed, or in any way amended, nor any provision hereof waived, except by mutual agreement of the parties in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto or their legal representatives.
 
13.3
 
Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect.
 
13.4
 
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same Agreement.
 
13.5
 
Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city, or other taxes as may be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling.
 
13.6
 
Beneficiaries. The Executive may designate one or more persons or entities as the primary and/or contingent beneficiaries of any amounts to be received under this Agreement. Such designation must be in the form of a signed writing acceptable to the Board or the Board's designee. The Executive may make or change such designation at any time.
 
13.7
 
Representation. The Executive represents that the Executive's employment by the Company and the performance by the Executive of his obligations under this Agreement do not, and shall not, breach any agreement that obligates him to keep in confidence any trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information of his or of any other party, to write or consult to any other party or to refrain from competing, directly or indirectly, with the business of any other party. The Executive shall not disclose to the Company, and the Company shall not request that the Executive disclose, any trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information of any other party.
 
13.8
 
Section 409A.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of laws.

(a)
 
In the event that the Executive shall become entitled to payments and/or benefits provided by this Agreement or any other amounts in the "nature of compensation" (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a change of ownership or effective control covered by Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) as a result of such change in ownership or effective control (collectively the "Company Payments"), and such Company Payments will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (and any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed by any taxing authority) the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in subsection (d) below an additional amount (the "Gross-up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Company Payments and any U.S. federal, state, and for local income or payroll tax upon the Gross-up Payment provided for by this paragraph (a), but before deduction for any U.S. federal, state, and local income or payroll tax on the Company Payments, shall be equal to the Company Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments (calculated in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) does not exceed 110% of the Safe Harbor Amount (which shall be 2.99 times the Executives base amount within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code), then the Company shall not pay the Executive a Gross-up Payment, and the Company Payments (whether due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company) shall be reduced so that the then present aggregate value of the Company Payments equals the Safe Harbor Amount.  The reduction of the Company Payments, if applicable, shall be effected in the following order (unless the Executive elects another method of reduction by written notice to the Company prior to the Change in Control): (i) any cash severance benefits based on a multiple of Base Salary or annual incentive compensation; (ii) any other cash amounts payable to the Executive; (iii) any benefits valued as parachute payments; (iv) acceleration of vesting of any stock option for which the exercise price exceeds the then fair market value of the underlying stock; and (v) acceleration of vesting of any equity award not covered by subsection (iv).
 
(b)
 
For purposes of determining whether any of the Company Payments and Gross-up Payments (collectively the "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (x) the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and except to the extent that, in the opinion of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to any change in ownership (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(2)) or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants") such Total Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments," represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the "base amount" or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (y) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
 
(c)
 
For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay U.S. federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of U.S. federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence for the calendar year in which the Company Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in U.S. federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes if paid in such year. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the prior Gross-up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and U.S. federal, state and local income tax imposed on the portion of the Gross-up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or a U.S. federal, state and local income tax deduction), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Gross-up Payment to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any U.S. federal, state and local tax authority, repayment thereof (and related amounts) shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to the Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed the interest received or credited to the Executive by such tax authority for the period it held such portion. The Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expense thereof) if the Executive's claim for refund or credit is denied.
 
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountant or the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalties payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
 
(d)
 
The Gross-up Payment or portion thereof provided for in subsection (c) above shall be paid not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following an event occurring which subjects the Executive to the Excise Tax; provided, however, that if the amount of such Gross-up Payment or portion thereof cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Accountant, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code), subject to further payments pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, as soon as the amount thereof can reasonably be determined, but in no event later than the ninetieth day after the occurrence of the event subjecting the Executive to the Excise Tax. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, the Company shall promptly notify the Executive of the excess payment, and the Executive shall repay the excess amount to the Company within fifteen days after the Executive receives the notice(together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).
 
 
(e)
 
In the event of any controversy with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with regard to the Excise Tax, the Executive shall permit the Company to control issues related to the Excise Tax (at its expense), provided that such issues do not potentially materially adversely affect the Executive, but the Executive shall control any other issues. In the event the issues are interrelated, the Executive and the Company shall in good faith cooperate so as not to jeopardize resolution of either issue, but if the parties cannot agree the Executive shall make the final determination with regard to the issues. In the event of any conference with any taxing authority as to the Excise Tax or associated income taxes, the Executive shall permit the representative of the Company to accompany the Executive, and the Executive and the Executive's representative shall cooperate with the Company and its representative.
 
(f)
 
The Company shall be responsible for all charges of the Accountant.
 
(g)
 
The Company and the Executive shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any verbal communications, with any taxing authority regarding the Excise Tax covered by this Exhibit A.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, for purposes of determining the Executive's benefits under the SERP, the definition of "Compensation" under the SERP shall be revised so as to exclude therefrom the value of any Performance Share Units granted to the Executive in respect of the 2006-08 performance cycle or any subsequent performance cycles.

The Executive will, therefore, travel frequently between such metropolitan areas. In recognition of such understandings, and in order to clarify the allocation of expenses for such travel, the parties have agreed to the following:
 
a)
 
To the extent that the Executive uses transportation equipment or facilities owned or operated by or for any member of the Textron Group, which equipment or facilities are not being diverted from another corporate use to accommodate the Executive, and without regard to the purpose of the Executive's travel, the Executive may utilize such equipment or facilities at no cost to him, provided, however, that to the extent required by any law, the Company shall report appropriate charges for any travel thereupon by the Executive as additional income to the Executive in accordance with such law and normal Company policy.
 
b)
 
The parties acknowledge and agree that the Executive will conduct Textron-Group related business in both Providence, Rhode Island and Washington, DC. To the extent that the Executive travels between such metropolitan areas on Textron Group-related business using commercial travel facilities, all such reasonable travel expenses shall be paid for or reimbursed by the Company in accordance with its normal policies for key executives.
 
c)
 
To the extent that such travel utilizes commercial travel facilities but is for non-Textron Group related purposes, the Executive shall be responsible for paying for or reimbursing the Company for all such expenses.

b)

d)
 
W&C shall not bill the Company for any time spent by the Executive with respect to any matter relating to any member of the Textron Group, nor will it bill the Company for any travel expenses incurred by the Executive in the course of such representation (all of which will be treated as employment-related expenses of the Executive subject to his Employment Agreement). W&C shall bill the Company, however, for all travel expenses of any other partner or employee of W&C, and for all messenger, photocopying and similar office services, all in accordance with its normal billing practices, without regard to whether the Executive directed the incurrence of such services on behalf of any member of the Textron Group or supervised the matter with respect to which such travel or services were ordered.
 
e)
 
W&C shall remain free to represent and to provide any services to or on behalf of any other clients to the same extent as if the Executive had no personal affiliation with the Company. The Executive shall timely inform W&C of any matter from which he should, in his good faith judgment, be screened, and W&C may rely in good faith on such determination by the Executive.
 
f)
 
The Company will indemnify, defend and hold harmless W&C and its partners, associates and staff from and against any liability, loss, cost or expense (a "Loss") incurred or suffered by any of them, in whatever capacity, in connection with or as a result of any investigation or proceeding of any sort to the extent relating to or arising out of any legal services performed by the Executive (including his supervision of any legal services provided by the firm for or on behalf of any member of the Textron Group) in his capacity as an employee of the Company, provided, however, no such indemnity shall apply if and to the extent that such Loss relates to or arises out of services deemed hereunder to have been performed by the firm for or on behalf of any member of the Textron Group (whether or not such services were supervised by the Executive).
 
g)
 
W&C and each other indemnified party under this Section 8 shall be a third party beneficiary thereof, with rights to enforce the provisions thereof to the extent related to such indemnified party.
 
 
Beginning as of January 1, 2006, and continuing on each anniversary thereof through and including January 1, 2009 (each a "Credit Date"), Textron will credit the Executive's Moody's Account within Textron's Deferred Income Plan for Textron Key Executives (the "Deferred Income Plan") with the sum of $157,465.00 per year over and above any other deferred income credited to any account of the Executive within the Deferred Income Plan (each such additional payment, a "Credit Date Payment"), provided, however, that no such additional Credit Date Payment shall be credited as of any Credit Date (a) unless the Executive is, as of such Credit Date, an employee of Textron, or (b) as otherwise provided in Sections 6.3(d) or 8.2(k) of the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Employment Agreement or this Exhibit B, Credit Date Payments shall not be included in measuring the Executive's compensation for purposes of any of the Company's pension plans.
 
 
To the extent that any commitment or covenant of the Company contained in either the Employment Agreement or this Second Amended and Restated Exhibit B, including without limitation the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of this Second Amended and Restated Exhibit B, shall constitute an exception to normal compensation or benefit policies of the Company for its key executives, the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall promptly and expressly approve such exceptions.
