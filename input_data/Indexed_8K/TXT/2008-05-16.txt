On May 13, 2008, Textron Financial Corporations (Textron Financial) affiliate, Textron Financial Floorplan Master Note Trust (the Trust), issued variable funding notes in an amount of up to $418.995 million (the Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Notes) pursuant to its dealer floorplan securitization program (the Floorplan Securitization Program).  Textron Financial is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Textron Inc.  The Class A Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Note is held by Socit Gnrale (SG), as managing agent for certain commercial paper conduits administered by SG, and provides for a commitment thereunder of $375 million.

The subordinated Class B Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Note is held by Textron Receivables Corporation III (TRC III), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Textron Financial.  The Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Notes were fully funded at closing and principal amounts may be repaid and incremental fundings may be made from time to time thereunder subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.  The scheduled termination date for the Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Notes is in May 2009.
The Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Notes and all other series of notes previously issued by the Trust and outstanding are all secured primarily by a revolving pool of dealer floorplan receivables originated from time to time by Textron Financial and sold to TRC III.  TRC III further conveys such receivables to the Trust.  Textron Financial will remain as servicer of the receivables.  As owner of the Trust, TRC III retains a residual interest in the assets of the Trust.
In connection with the issuance of the Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Notes, Textron Financial and the Trust entered into a Series 2008-CP-2 Supplement to the Amended and Restated Indenture, by and among the Trust, The Bank of New York, as indenture trustee, and Textron Financial, as servicer, pursuant to which the Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Notes were issued and collections, defaults and other amounts in respect of the receivables are allocated to the Series 2008-CP-2 Variable Funding Notes (the Agreement).

The sale of receivables under the Floorplan Securitization Program is an off-balance sheet arrangement.
