Late on October 16, 2008, Textron Inc. ("Textron") was notified by the U.S. Department of Defense that the U.S. Army Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) program will not be certified for continuation.
 
As of October 16, 2008, Textron estimates that its inventory and vendor obligations incurred with respect to the ARH program total approximately $95 - $100 million, and reserves for this program total $50 million.
 
Textron is currently evaluating several avenues by which it believes that it may be able to recover some or all of its investment in inventory and its obligations to vendors.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
