 Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) today announced that it has drawn the balance of the $3.0 billion committed bank credit lines available to Textron and its commercial finance subsidiary, Textron Financial Corporation (TFC).  After repayment of all commercial paper outstanding, this will provide the enterprise with added cash liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion. Amounts borrowed under the credit lines will not be due for repayment until April of 2012.
Providence, Rhode Island  February 4, 2009
"Todays actions are consistent with the comprehensive liquidity plan outlined in our earnings call, and we believe the additional liquidity puts Textron and TFC in a strong position for 2009 and beyond.  It is prudent to ensure cash liquidity in the current environment, and the bank credit lines provide such liquidity at very attractive terms.  This liquidity strengthens Textron and will put TFC in a stronger position as it executes its downsizing strategy," said Textron Chairman and CEO Lewis B. Campbell. The companys liquidity plan includes the liquidation of non-captive finance receivables, asset sales at TFC, new TFC securitizations or securitization extensions, capital market alternatives, Textron asset sales and cash generated by manufacturing operations.
