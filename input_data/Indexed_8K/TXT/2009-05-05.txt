Item 1.01
      
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Offering of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013
 
On April 29, 2009, Textron Inc. ("Textron"), entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Notes Underwriting Agreement") with the underwriters named therein, for whom Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as joint book-running managers, to issue and sell $600 million principal amount of its 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013, including $60 million principal amount thereof issued and sold pursuant to the option granted by Textron to such underwriters (collectively, the "Notes"), which option was exercised in full on April 30, 2009. Textron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, including the Notes sold upon the exercise of such option, will be approximately $582 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before offering expenses payable by Textron.
 
The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to Textron's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-152562) (the "Registration Statement"), including the prospectus contained therein dated July 28, 2008, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated April 29, 2009 (as so supplemented, the "Notes Prospectus"), filed by Textron with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Textron issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of September 10, 1999 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of May 5, 2009 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between Textron and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York), as trustee (the "Trustee"). Terms of the Indenture and the Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture are described in the section of the Notes Prospectus entitled "Description of notes," which is incorporated herein by reference. The following description of the Notes and the Indenture is a summary and is not meant to be a complete description of the Notes and the Indenture. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture.
 
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2009. The Notes will mature on May 1, 2013, unless earlier converted or repurchased.
 
The Notes are convertible in certain circumstances and during certain periods into Textron's common stock, par value $0.125 per share (the "Common Stock"), cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock (as described in the Supplemental Indenture) at an initial conversion rate of 76.1905 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.1250 per share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances as set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. The initial conversion price represents a conversion premium of 25% over the public offering price of $10.50 per share in the offering of Common Stock described under "
Offering of Common Stock" below.
 
Upon a fundamental change (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), holders may require Textron to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
fundamental change repurchase date. The Notes are not redeemable at Textron's option prior to maturity.
 
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes, and the interest accrued on such Notes, if any, to be immediately due and payable.
 
In connection with the issuance and sale by Textron of the Notes as described under this Item 1.01 of this Current Report, the following exhibits are filed with this Current Report and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Notes Prospectus: (i) the Notes Underwriting Agreement (Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report); (ii) the Base Indenture (Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report); (iii) the Supplemental Indenture (Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report); (iv) the form of Note (Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report); and (v) the updated legal opinion of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report).
 
Offering of Common Stock
 
On April 29, 2009, Textron also entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Common Stock Underwriting Agreement") with the underwriters named therein, for whom Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as joint book-running managers, to issue and sell 23,805,000 shares of Common Stock, including 3,105,000 shares of Common Stock issued and sold pursuant to the option granted by Textron to such underwriters (collectively, the "Shares"), which option was exercised in full on May 1, 2009. Textron estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, including the Shares sold upon the exercise of such option, will be approximately $239 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before offering expenses payable by Textron.
 
The sale of the Shares was made pursuant to the Registration Statement, including the prospectus contained therein dated July 28, 2008, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated April 29, 2009 (as so supplemented, the "Common Stock Prospectus"), filed by Textron with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
In connection with the issuance and sale by Textron of the Shares as described under this Item 1.01 of this Current Report, the following exhibits are filed with this Current Report and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Common Stock Prospectus: (i) the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement (Exhibit 1.2 to this Current Report); (ii) the specimen of Common Stock certificate (Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report); and (iii) the updated legal opinion of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report).
 
Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
 
On April 29, 2009 and April 30, 2009, in connection with Textron's issuance of the Notes, Textron entered into a Convertible Bond Hedge Transaction Confirmation with each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association to purchase convertible note hedges (collectively, the "Hedge Confirmations"). The initial strike price of the convertible note hedges is $13.1250 per share of Common Stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the Notes) and is similarly subject to certain
customary adjustments (other than those arising from a fundamental change, a change of control or certain other conditions specified in the Hedge Confirmations). The convertible note hedge transactions cover an aggregate of 45,714,300 shares of Common Stock.
 
On April 29, 2009 and April 30, 2009, in connection with Textron's issuance of the Notes, Textron entered into an Issuer Warrant Transaction Confirmation with each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association to sell equity warrants (collectively, the "Warrant Confirmations"). The initial strike price of the equity warrants is $15.75 per share of Common Stock and is similarly subject to certain customary adjustments (other than those arising from a fundamental change, a change of control or other certain conditions specified in the Warrant Confirmations). The equity warrants cover an aggregate of 45,714,300 shares of Common Stock.
 
The transactions contemplated by the Hedge Confirmations (the "Convertible Note Hedge Transactions") are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of Common Stock, as measured under Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, at the time of conversion of the Notes is greater than the strike price under the Hedge Confirmations, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is similarly subject to certain customary adjustments. If, however, the market price per share of Common Stock, as measured under the terms of transactions contemplated by the Warrant Confirmations (the "Warrant Transactions"), exceeds the strike price under the Warrant Confirmations when they are exercised, there would be dilution from conversion of the Notes to the extent that the then market price per share of Common Stock exceeds the strike price under the Warrant Confirmations.
 
The description above is qualified in its entirety by the Hedge Confirmations and the Warrant Confirmations, including the Reformation Agreements thereto, which are included as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.12 to this Current Report and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Notes Prospectus and the Common Stock Prospectus.

The exact stock prices and effective dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case if the stock price is between two stock price amounts in the table or the effective date is between two effective dates in the table, the number of additional shares will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of additional shares set forth for the higher and lower stock price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year.

greater than $100.00 per share (subject to adjustment), the conversion rate will not be increased; or
 
less than $10.50 per share (subject to adjustment), the conversion rate will not be increased.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of the Issuer's common stock issuable upon conversion exceed 95.2381 per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes (which number shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing $1,000 by the closing sale price of the Issuer's common stock on the Pricing Date), subject to adjustments in the same manner as the conversion rate as set forth under "Description of notesConversion rate adjustments" in the preliminary prospectus supplement dated April 28, 2009 for the Convertible Senior Notes Offering.

(b)
                                
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Managers specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that (i) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (ii) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (iii) the sentence on the cover page regarding the date
on which the Underwriters expect to deliver the Offered Securities in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c)
                                 
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such proceeding and it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or relating proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Managers in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matters of such proceeding and (B) does not include a

statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party
.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the second or third paragraphs hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VIII were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VIII are several, in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint. For purposes of this Article VIII, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VIII and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Managers, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Managers, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (v), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Managers, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Underwriting Agreement bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Managers may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; that in no event shall the principal amount of the Offered Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase hereunder be increased pursuant to this Article IX by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of the Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they agreed to purchase hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities, and arrangements satisfactory to Managers and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. In any such case either the Managers or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph or any such termination shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Article VIII hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. The provisions of Article VIII hereof and this Article X hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
 
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Article VIII hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
 
The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with
the offering of the Offered Securities and the process leading up to the offering of the Offered Securities is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
The Company and the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matters of such proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the second or third paragraphs hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VII were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VII, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VII are several, in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint. For purposes of this Article VII, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VII and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Managers, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Chicago Board of Options
Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Managers, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (v), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Managers, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
 
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Underwriting Agreement bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Managers may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; that in no event shall the principal amount of the Offered Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase hereunder be increased pursuant to this Article VIII by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of the Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they agreed to purchase hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities, and arrangements satisfactory to Managers and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. In any such case either the Managers or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph or any such termination shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Article VII hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. The provisions of Article VII hereof and this Article IX hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
 
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Article VII hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
 
The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with
the offering of the Offered Securities and the process leading up to the offering of the Offered Securities is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
The Company and the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any
legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

If, in respect of any conversion, the Company has not previously made an election with respect to the settlement method it chooses in respect of any Conversion Obligation upon conversion of any Notes and does not timely make such an election, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to settle such conversion in the manner set forth in Section 9.01(b)(3) with a Fixed Dollar Amount equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes.
 
Settlement of conversions (x) solely in shares of Common Stock (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall occur on the third (3rd) Trading Day following the final Settlement Period Trading Day of the Settlement Period that would be applicable if settlement were in cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, and (y) in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock shall occur on the third (3rd) Trading Day following the final Settlement Period Trading Day of the applicable Settlement Period.

If the Company has elected to satisfy the entire Conversion Obligation in Common Stock only, the applicable Settlement Period used to calculate the cash payment under this Section 9.02(i) shall be the Settlement Period that would be applicable if settlement of the Conversion Obligation were in cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.

shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") determined pursuant to this Section 9.03.
Additional Shares
 
Any conversion will be deemed to have occurred in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change only if such Notes are surrendered for conversion at a time when the Notes would be convertible in light of the occurrence of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change and notwithstanding the fact that a Note may then be convertible because another condition to conversion has been satisfied.
 
The number of Additional Shares shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which such Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the "") and the Stock Price paid per share for the Common Stock in such Make-Whole Fundamental Change.  The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table below (, the column headers) shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted to equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.  The number of Additional Shares in the table will be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 9.04.

(2)
                                 
(a) if the actual Stock Price is greater than $100.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table above pursuant to this Section 9.03), then the Conversion Rate will not be increased, or (b) if the actual Stock Price is less than $10.50 per share (subject to adjustment in the
 
same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table above pursuant to this Section 9.03), then the Conversion Rate will not be increased.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Conversion Rate as adjusted exceed 95.2381 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 9.04.
 
SECTION 9.04.   .  The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
 
(a)
         
If the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after (x) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or (y) the effective date of such share split or share combination.  If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 9.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b)
        
If the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock, at a price per share less than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such distribution.  In the event that such rights or warrants described in this Section 9.04(b) are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the Record Date for such distribution had not occurred. To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of the Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of the Common Stock actually delivered. In determining the aggregate price payable for such shares of the Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration if other than cash to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
(c)
         
If the Company shall distribute shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other of its assets or property to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, excluding (v) any dividends or distributions referred to in Section 9.04(a); (w) any rights or warrants referred to in Section 9.04(b); (x) any dividends or distributions covered by Section 9.04(d); (y) any dividends and distributions in connection with a Reorganization Event covered by Section 9.05; and (z) any Spin-Off to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 9.04(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, or other assets or property, ""), then, in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
 
where
 
 
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 9.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series of, or similar equity interest in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), that are, or, when issued, will be, quoted or listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market or any other national or regional securities exchange or market, the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.  If such dividend or distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
For the purposes of this Section 9.04(c) (and subject in all respects to Section 9.08), rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (a ):  (1) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (2) are not exercisable; and (3) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common

Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 9.04(c), (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 9.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 9.04(c).  If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date of such deemed distribution (in which case the original rights or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders).  In addition, in the event of any distribution or deemed distribution of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 9.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any Holders thereof, upon such final redemption or repurchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming each such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
 
For the purposes of this Section 9.04(c) and subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9.04, any dividend or distribution to which this Section 9.04(c) applies which also includes one or both of:
 
(A)

the dividend or distribution of rights or warrants to which Section 9.04(b) applies
, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 9.04(c) applies and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 9.04(c) with respect thereto shall then be made, and (2) the dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 9.04(a) applies and the dividend or distribution of shares of
Common Stock to which Section 9.04(b) applies shall be deemed to immediately follow such dividend or distribution to which this Section 9.04(c) applies and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 9.04(a) and Section 9.04(b) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Company, (I) the "Record Date" of the dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 9.04(a) applies and the dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 9.04(b) applies shall be deemed to be the Record Date of such dividend or distribution to which this Section 9.04(c) applies and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 9.04(a) applies
or
the dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 9.04(b) applies

(d)
        
If the Company pays any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, other than a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.02 (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Initial Dividend Threshold
 
where
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the Record Date for such dividend or distribution.  In the event that any such dividend or distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
The Initial Dividend Threshold shall be adjusted in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate; that no adjustment shall be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 9.04(d).

If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock subject to the tender offer rules, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately succeeding the last date (the "") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
where
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.  In the event the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.  Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this clause (e) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 9.04(e).

To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least twenty (20) Business Days if the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the Company's best interest, which determination shall be conclusive.  Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to holders of record of the Notes a notice of the increase, which notice will be given at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the effectiveness of any such increase, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
 
(h)
        
In addition, the Company may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event.
 
(i)
            
All calculations and other determinations under this Article 9 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share.  No adjustment pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time.  However, any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% within one year of the first adjustment carried forward, upon a Fundamental Change, upon a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, and on each day beginning with the forty-seventh (47th) Scheduled Trading Day and ending on and including the second (2nd) Scheduled Trading Day prior to the Maturity Date.
 
(j)
            
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company will issue a press release containing the relevant information, including, but not limited to, any
applicable declaration date, and make this information available on its website.  In addition, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth any applicable declaration date and the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect.  Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Security Register within twenty (20) calendar days of the effective date of such adjustment.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
 
(k)
         
In any case in which this Section 9.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (i) a Record Date for a dividend or distribution described in Section 9.04(a), 9.04(b), 9.04(d), (ii) the effective date for a share split or share combination of the Common Stock described in Section 9.04(a), (iii) a Record Date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 9.04(b), or (iv) the expiration date for any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 9.04(e), (each, a ""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Notes converted after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fractional share pursuant to Section 9.04.  For purposes of this Section 9.04(k), the term "" shall mean:

(l)
                        
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing clauses in this Section 9.04, the applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 9.04 if the Holders of the Notes will participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to adjustment pursuant to this Section 9.04 without conversion of such Holder's Notes on a basis equivalent to a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the principal amount of the Notes held by the Holder the applicable Conversion Price.  In no event will the Company adjust the
divided by
Conversion Rate to the extent that the adjustment would reduce the Conversion Price below the par value per share of Common Stock.  In addition, the applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
 
(1)
                                 
for the issuance of shares of Common Stock, including in connection with satisfaction of the Company's Conversion Obligation in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities;
 
(2)

(3)

(4)
                                 
for a change in the par value of the Common Stock.
 
(m)
                  
For purposes of this Section 9.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.  The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
(n)
                    
Whenever any provision of this Article 9 requires a calculation of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to a sum or an average of the VWAPs or the Last Reported Sale Prices over a span of multiple days, the Company will make appropriate adjustments (determined by the Board of Directors) to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period from which the sum or average is to be calculated.

If the Reorganization Event causes the Common Stock to be exchanged for more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the Reference Property into which the Notes will be convertible will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively made such an election.  In all cases, the provisions under Section 9.02 shall continue to apply with respect to the calculation of the Conversion Obligation and the method of settlement.  The Company hereby agrees not to become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the foregoing.  Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 9.

(b)
        
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

(d)
        
of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company;
 
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing on the Security Register, as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the declaration date of the dividend or other distribution, (y) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (z) the date on which such reclassification, share exchange, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale, lease or other disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

Textron Inc.
40 Westminster Street
Providence, Rhode Island 02903
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel for Textron Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of (a) 23,805,000 shares (the "Shares") of Common Stock, par value $0.125 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated April 29, 2009 between the Company and the several underwriters named therein (the "Common Stock Underwriting Agreement") and (b) $600,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated April 29, 2009 between the Company and the several underwriters named therein (the "Notes Underwriting Agreement and, together with the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreements"). The Notes are being issued under the Indenture dated as of
September 10, 1999
, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of May 5, 2009 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.
, as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
We have reviewed (a) the Underwriting Agreements, (b) the Indenture, (c) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-
152562
) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company to register the Shares and the Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"), (d) the Prospectus dated July 28, 2008, as supplemented by (i) the Prospectus Supplement dated April 29, 2009 relating to the offer and sale of the Shares, and (ii) the Prospectus Supplement relating to the offer and sale of the Notes (collectively, the "Prospectus Supplements"), filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Act. We have not reviewed any certificates representing the Common Stock or the Notes, except a specimen and form, respectively, thereof. We have also reviewed such other agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials, and have satisfied ourselves as to such other matters, as we have considered relevant or necessary as a basis for this opinion.
 
In such review, we have assumed the accuracy and completeness of all agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials submitted to us, the conformity with the originals of all such materials submitted to us as copies (whether or not certified and including facsimiles), the authenticity of the originals of such materials and all materials submitted to us as originals, the
 
genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all natural persons. In delivering this opinion, we have relied, without independent verification, as to factual matters, on certificates and other written or oral statements of governmental and other public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and the Trustee and the underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreements.
 
On the basis of the assumptions and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.
            
The Shares have been validly issued, fully paid and is nonassessable.
 
2.
            
The Notes constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be subject to and limited by the effect of (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (b) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (c) requirements of reasonableness, good faith, materiality and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any matter may be brought.
 
This opinion is limited to the law of the State of New York and the Delaware General Corporation Law, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Commission on the date hereof and the incorporation thereof in the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the caption "Legal matters" in each of the Prospectus Supplements. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
 
Very truly yours,

If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against the Indemnified Person as a result of Counterparty's failure to provide Bank with a Repurchase Notice in accordance with this paragraph, such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify Counterparty in writing, and Counterparty, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others Counterparty may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding.

Transfer Options
provided
 
(A)
                             
With respect to any Transfer Options, Counterparty shall not be released from its notice and indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9(c) or any obligations under Section 9(r) or 9(v) of this Confirmation;
 
(B)
                               
Any Transfer Options shall only be transferred or assigned to a third party that is a U.S. person (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended);
 
(C)
          
Such transfer or assignment shall be effected on terms, including any reasonable undertakings by such third party (including, but not limited to, an undertaking with respect to compliance with applicable securities laws in a manner that, in the reasonable judgment of Bank, will not expose Bank to material risks under applicable securities laws) and execution of any documentation and delivery of legal opinions with respect to securities laws and other matters by such third party and Counterparty, as are requested and reasonably satisfactory to Bank;
 
(D)
         
Bank will not, as a result of such transfer and assignment, be required to pay the transferee on any payment date an amount under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement greater than an amount that Bank would have been required to pay to Counterparty in the absence of such transfer and assignment;
 
(E)
          
An Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Termination Event will not occur as a result of such transfer and assignment;
 
(F)

determine that results described in clauses (D) and (E) will not occur upon or after such transfer and assignment; and
 
(G)
          
Counterparty shall be responsible for all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred by Bank in connection with such transfer or assignment.
 
(ii)
          
Bank may transfer or assign without any consent of Counterparty its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any of its affiliates whose obligations hereunder would be guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; that Bank may transfer or assign all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Transaction without consent of Counterparty to any third party with a rating for its long term, unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness equal to or better than the lesser of (1) the credit rating of Bank at the time of the transfer and (2) A- by Standard and Poor's Rating Group, Inc. or its successor (""), or A3 by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("") or, if either S&P or Moody's ceases to rate such debt, at least an equivalent rating or better by a substitute agency rating mutually agreed by Counterparty and Bank. If after Bank's commercially reasonable efforts, Bank is unable to effect a transfer or assignment on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Bank and within a time period reasonably acceptable to Bank of a sufficient number of Options to reduce (1) Bank Group's "beneficial ownership" (within the meaning of Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated thereunder) to 7.5% of Counterparty's outstanding Shares or less, (2) the Option Equity Percentage to 14.5% or less, and (3) the Share Amount to the Post-Effective Limit (if any applies) or less, Bank may designate any Exchange Business Day as an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion (the "") of the Transaction, such that (1) Bank Group's "beneficial ownership" following such partial termination will be equal to or less than 7.5%, (2) the Option Equity Percentage following such partial termination will be equal to or less than 14.5%, and (3) the Share Amount following such partial termination will be equal to or less than such Post-Effective Limit.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Bank to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any shares or other securities to or from Counterparty, Bank may designate any of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Bank's obligations in respect of the Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations.

Staggered Settlement
. If upon advice of counsel with respect to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including any requirements relating to Bank's hedging activities hereunder, or due to inability to borrow Shares to deliver to Counterparty at a rate of borrowing less than 35 basis points, Bank reasonably determines that it would not be practicable or advisable to deliver, or to acquire Shares to deliver, any or all of the Shares to be delivered by Bank on the Settlement Date for the Transaction, Bank may, by notice to Counterparty on or prior to any Settlement Date (a ""), elect to deliver the Shares on two or more dates (each, a "") as follows:

(a)
                                 
in such notice, Bank will specify to Counterparty the related Staggered Settlement Dates, which Bank shall choose in a commercially reasonable manner, (the first of which will be such Nominal Settlement Date and the last of which will be no later than the twentieth (20th) Exchange Business Day following such Nominal Settlement Date) and the number of Shares that it will deliver on each Staggered Settlement Date on a payment versus delivery basis;
 
(b)
                                
the aggregate number of Shares that Bank will deliver to Counterparty hereunder on all such Staggered Settlement Dates will equal the number of Shares that Bank would otherwise be required to deliver on such Nominal Settlement Date; and
 
(c)
                                 
if the Physical Settlement terms, the Low Cash Combination Settlement terms or the High Cash Combination Settlement terms set forth above were to apply on the Nominal Settlement Date, then the Physical Settlement terms, the Low Cash Combination Settlement terms or the High Cash Combination Settlement terms, as the case may be, will apply on each Staggered Settlement Date, except that the Shares will be allocated among such Staggered Settlement Dates as specified by Bank in the notice referred to in clause (a) above.
 
(j)
                                    
Damages
. Neither party shall be liable under Section 6.10 of the Equity Definitions for special, indirect or consequential damages, even if informed of the possibility thereof, except as specifically set forth otherwise herein.
 
(k)
                                 
Early Unwind
. In the event the sale of Convertible Notes is not consummated with the Underwriters for any reason or Counterparty fails to deliver to Bank opinions of counsel to Counterparty as required pursuant to Section 9(a) by the close of business in New York on May 5, 2009 or such later date as agreed upon by the parties (May 5, 2009 or such later date the ""), the Transaction shall automatically terminate (the ""), on the Early Unwind Date and (i) the Transaction and all of the respective rights and obligations of Bank and Counterparty under the Transaction shall be cancelled and terminated and (ii) each party shall be released and discharged by the other party from and agrees not to make any claim against the other party with respect to any obligations or liabilities of the other party arising out of and to be performed in connection with the Transaction either prior to or after the Early Unwind Date; that, other than to the extent the Early Unwind Date occurred as a result of the breach of the Underwriting Agreement by the Underwriters, Counterparty shall reimburse Bank, in cash or Shares, for any costs or expenses (including market losses) relating to the unwinding of its or its

Bank and Counterparty represent and acknowledge to the other that, subject to the proviso included in this paragraph, upon an Early Unwind, all obligations with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed fully and finally discharged.
 
(l)
                                    
Role of Agent

Bank may postpone, in whole or in part, any Expiration Date or any other date of valuation or delivery with respect to some or all of the relevant Warrants (in which event the Calculation Agent shall make appropriate adjustments to the Daily Number of Warrants with respect to one or more Expiration Dates) if Bank determines, in its commercially reasonable judgment, that such extension is reasonably necessary or appropriate to preserve Bank's hedging or hedge unwind activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions or to enable Bank to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging, hedge unwind or settlement activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Bank were Issuer or an affiliated purchaser of Issuer, be in compliance with applicable legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements, or with related policies and procedures applicable to Bank.

Bank may transfer or assign without any consent of Counterparty its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any of its affiliates whose obligations hereunder would be guaranteed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; that Bank may transfer or assign all or any portion of its rights or obligations under the Transaction without consent of Counterparty to any third party with a rating for its long term, unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness equal to or better than the lesser of (1) the credit rating of Bank at the time of the transfer and (2) A- by Standard and Poor's Rating Group, Inc. or its successor (""), or A3 by Moody's Investor Service, Inc.

If after Bank's commercially reasonable efforts, Bank is unable to effect a transfer or assignment on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to Bank and within a time period reasonably acceptable to Bank of a sufficient number of Options to reduce (1) Bank Group's "beneficial ownership" (within the meaning of Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated thereunder) to 7.5% of Counterparty's outstanding Shares or less, (2) the Option Equity Percentage to 14.5% or less, and (3) the Share Amount to the Post-Effective Limit (if any applies) or less, Bank may designate any Exchange Business Day as an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion (the "") of the Transaction, such that (1) Bank Group's "beneficial ownership" following such partial termination will be equal to or less than 7.5%, (2) the Option Equity Percentage following such partial termination will be equal to or less than 14.5%, and (3) the Share Amount following such partial termination will be equal to or less than such Post-Effective Limit. In the event that Bank so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of the Transaction, a payment shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (1) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to the Transaction and a Number of Options equal to the Terminated Portion, (2) Counterparty shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (3) such Transaction shall be the only Terminated Transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of paragraph 9(o) shall apply to any amount that is payable by Bank to Counterparty pursuant to this sentence).

Staggered Settlement

If upon advice of counsel with respect to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including any requirements relating to Bank's hedging activities hereunder, or due to inability to borrow Shares to deliver to Counterparty at a rate of borrowing less than 35 basis points, Bank reasonably determines that it would not be practicable or advisable to deliver, or to acquire Shares to deliver, any or all of the Shares to be delivered by Bank on the Settlement Date for the Transaction, Bank may, by notice to Counterparty on or prior to any Settlement Date (a ""), elect to deliver the Shares on two or more dates (each, a "") as follows:
Nominal Settlement Date

If any delivery owed to Bank hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, the Company's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and the Company shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Exchange Business Day after, Bank gives notice to the Company that such delivery would not result in (i) the Share Amount exceeding the Post-Effective Limit, or (ii) Bank Group directly or indirectly beneficially owning in excess of the Threshold Number of Shares.

The Company further agrees that any delivery of Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property prior to the date that is 6 months from the Trade Date (or 1 year from the Trade Date if, at such time, informational requirements of Rule 144(c) are not satisfied with respect to the Company), may be transferred by and among Bank and its affiliates and the Company shall effect such transfer without any further action by Bank.

(y) the event where upon Bank or its affiliate would incur a materially increased cost in establishing, re-establishing or maintaining a full hedge of the equity price risk (including without limitation the volatility risk) in respect of the Transaction directly or indirectly as a result of actions taken by the Company.

Bank may postpone, in whole or in part, any Expiration Date or any other date of valuation or delivery with respect to some or all of the relevant Warrants (in which event the Calculation Agent shall make appropriate adjustments to the Daily Number of Warrants with respect to one or more Expiration Dates) if Bank determines, in its commercially reasonable judgment, that such extension is reasonably necessary or appropriate to preserve Bank's hedging or hedge unwind activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions or to enable Bank to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging, hedge unwind or settlement activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Bank were Issuer or an affiliated purchaser of Issuer, be in compliance with applicable legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements, or with related policies and procedures applicable to Bank.

WHEREAS, the parties wish to reform the Confirmation to reflect their mutual intention and to avoid any doubt that settlement of the Transaction pursuant to Section 9(o)(i) of the Confirmation does not require approval of the Company's shareholders under the rules of the NYSE;
 
NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
 
1.
                                     
As of the "Trade Date" (as defined in the Confirmation), the definition of "Maximum Amount" in Section 9(o)(i) of the Confirmation shall be "1.45 times the Number of Shares," and all references in the Confirmation to the "Maximum Amount" shall be references to the "Maximum Amount" as so defined.
 
2.
                                     
Except as set forth in Section 1 above, all the terms of the Transaction and provisions in the Confirmation shall remain and continue in full force and effect and are hereby confirmed in all respects.
 
3.
                                     
This Reformation Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if all of the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
 
4.
                                     
The provisions of this Reformation Agreement shall be governed by
New York law (without reference to choice of law doctrine).
