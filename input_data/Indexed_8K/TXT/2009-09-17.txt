(a)
          
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Offered Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Offered Securities, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Managers specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that (i) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (ii) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (iii) the sentence on the cover page regarding the date on which the Offered Securities are expected to be delivered in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c)
          
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such proceeding and it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from
indemnified party
indemnifying party
any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or relating proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Managers in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matters of such proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the second or third paragraphs hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Offered Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VIII were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VIII are several, in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Offered Securities purchased by each of such Underwriters, and not joint. For purposes of this Article VIII, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VIII and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Managers, by notice given to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Managers, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (v), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Managers, impracticable to market the Offered Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
 
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Underwriting Agreement bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Managers may specify, to purchase the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; that in no event shall the principal amount of the Offered Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase hereunder be increased pursuant to this Article IX by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of the Offered Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any
provided
Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they agreed to purchase hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities, and arrangements satisfactory to Managers and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. In any such case either the Managers or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph or any such termination shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement, with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
 
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Article VIII hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. The provisions of Article VIII hereof and this Article X hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
 
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Article VIII hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with
the offering of the Offered Securities and the process leading up to the offering of the Offered Securities is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
The Company and the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

The terms of this Security include those stated in, or made pursuant to, the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and reference is made to the Indenture, all indentures supplemental thereto and all written instruments of Textron establishing such terms for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of Textron, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
This Global Security is not subject to a mandatory or optional sinking fund requirement.
 
The Securities shall be redeemable, at the option of Textron, in whole or in part on any date prior to Maturity (the "Redemption Date") at the Redemption Price (as defined herein), plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities up to, but not including, the Redemption Date. For all purposes hereof:
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the annual rate equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date:
 
(a)           the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or

Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (a) Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their successors; provided, however,that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, Textron shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (b) any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by Textron.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the average, as determined by Textron, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) which such Reference Treasury Dealer quotes in writing to the Trustee at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day before such Redemption Date.
 
The notice of redemption of the Securities may summarize the method by which the Redemption Price will be determined rather than state the actual dollar amount.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein), unless Textron has exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to provisions hereof, each Holder of Securities will have the right to require Textron to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Securities as provided herein (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Securities to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
 
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, Textron shall send, by first class mail, a notice to each Holder of Securities, with a written copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall state:
 
 
 
On the Change of Control Payment Date, Textron shall, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment all Securities or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions thereof properly tendered and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation the Securities properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions thereof being purchased by Textron. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Securities properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Securities, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an order from Textron, shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to such Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered by such Holder, if any, in denominations as set forth in the Indenture.
 
Textron shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions hereof, Textron will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such conflicts.

"Capital Stock" of any Person means any and all shares, interests, rights to purchase, warrants, options, participation or other equivalents of or interests in

The Securities of this series are issuable only in denominations of $2,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 unless otherwise specified above.

If at any time (a) the Depository notifies Textron that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the Securities evidenced hereby or if at any time the Depository shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation and a successor Depository is not appointed by Textron within 90 days after Textron receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, or (b) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and DTC requests the issuance of Securities in definitive registered form, Textron will execute, and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver, Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in denomination of $2,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 (such denominations referred to herein as "authorized denominations"), of like tenor and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security in exchange for this Global Security. In addition, Textron may at any time determine that the Securities evidenced hereby shall no longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event Textron will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination by Textron, will authenticate and deliver Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and of like tenor and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security in exchange for this Global Security. Upon the exchange of this Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form, without coupons, in authorized denominations, this Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for this Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee.

TEXTRON INC. 7.25% NOTE DUE OCTOBER 1, 2019
 
This Security is a Global Security evidencing a security of the duly authorized series of securities of Textron designated as its 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2019 (the securities of such series are herein called the "Securities"), issued under an Indenture, dated as of September 10, 1999 (herein called the "Indenture"), between Textron and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee to The Bank of New York (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture). The terms of this Security include those stated in, or made pursuant to, the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and reference is made to the Indenture, all indentures supplemental thereto and all written instruments of Textron establishing such terms for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of Textron, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
This Global Security is not subject to a mandatory or optional sinking fund requirement.
 
The Securities shall be redeemable, at the option of Textron, in whole or in part on any date prior to Maturity (the "Redemption Date") at the Redemption Price (as defined herein), plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities up to, but not including, the Redemption Date. For all purposes hereof:
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the annual rate equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date:
 
(a)
          
the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or
 
(b)
          
if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury
 
 
Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.
 
"Primary Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City.
 
"Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by Textron.
 
"Redemption Price" means the greater of: (a) 100% of the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and (b) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal on such Securities and interest on such Securities that would be due on or after the Redemption Date but for such redemption (not including any portion of such interest payments accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (a) Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their successors; provided, however,that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, Textron shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (b) any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by Textron.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and the redemption of Securities on a Redemption Date, the average, as determined by Textron, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) which such Reference Treasury Dealer quotes in writing to the Trustee at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day before such Redemption Date.
 
The notice of redemption of the Securities may summarize the method by which the Redemption Price will be determined rather than state the actual dollar amount.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein), unless Textron has exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to provisions hereof, each Holder of Securities will have the right to require Textron to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Securities as provided herein (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Securities to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
 
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, Textron shall send, by first class mail, a notice to each Holder of Securities, with a written copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall state:
 
 
(i)
           
a description of the transaction or transactions that constitute such Change of Control Triggering Event;
 
(ii)
          
that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to provisions hereof and that all
Securities
validly tendered will be accepted for payment;
 
(iii)
         
the Change of Control Payment and the Change of Control Payment Date, which shall be a Business Day that is no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be required by law;
 
(iv)
         
that any
Security
not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
 
(v)
          
that any
Security
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest on and after the Change of Control Payment Date unless Textron shall default in the Change of Control Payment and the only remaining right of the Holder thereof is to receive the Change of Control Payment upon surrender of such
Security
to the Paying Agent;
 
(vi)
         
that Holders of the Securities electing to have a portion of a
Security
purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may only elect to have such
Security
purchased in a principal amount of $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof;
 
(vii)
        
that if a Holder of Securities elects to have such
Securities
purchased pursuant to the Change of Control Offer it will be required to surrender such
Securities
, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of such
Securities
completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date;
 
(viii)
       
that a Holder of Securities will be entitled to withdraw its election if Textron receives, not later than the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of
Securities
such Holder delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such
Securities
purchased; and
 
(ix)
          
that if
Securities
are purchased only in part a new
Security
of the same type will be issued in a principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of the
Securities
surrendered.
 
 
On the Change of Control Payment Date, Textron shall, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment all Securities or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions thereof properly tendered and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation the Securities properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions thereof being purchased by Textron. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Securities properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Securities, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an order from Textron, shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to such Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered by such Holder, if any, in denominations as set forth in the Indenture.
 
Textron shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions hereof, Textron will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such conflicts.
 
For all purposes hereof:
 
"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the ratings on the Securities are lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of the Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies); provided that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee or Textron in writing at the Trustee's or Textron's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by Textron with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Global Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Global Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Global Security.
 
Without the consent of the Holder of any Securities, Textron and the Trustee may enter into one or more indentures supplemental to the Indenture to evidence the succession of another corporation to Textron and the assumption by such successor of the covenants of Textron in the Indenture or this Global Security, to add to the covenants of Textron for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities, to add
 
 
additional Events of Default, to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no Security Outstanding of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is adversely affected by such provision, to secure the Securities of any series, to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series, to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts under the Indenture by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of the Indenture, to cure any ambiguity, to correct any defect or inconsistency or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture which shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect or for the other purposes set forth in the Indenture.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth and herein provided, the transfer of this Global Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Global Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of Textron in any place where the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Global Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to Textron and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon a new Global Security evidencing the Securities evidenced hereby, or like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transfer or transferees; , , that for so long as any Securities are evidenced by this Global Security, this Global Security may be transferred in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depository or to a successor Depository selected or approved by Textron or to a nominee of such successor Depository.
provided
however
 
There is no limit on the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series that may be issued by Textron. Without notice to or consent of any Holder of any Securities of this series, Textron may, from time to time and at any time, issue and sell additional Securities of this series with the same title and terms as this Security, except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such additional Securities or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Securities.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in denominations of $2,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 unless otherwise specified above. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but Textron may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
 
Prior to due presentment of this Global Security for registration of transfer, Textron, the Trustee and any agent of Textron or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Global Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Global Security is overdue, and neither Textron, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
If at any time (a) the Depository notifies Textron that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the Securities evidenced hereby or if at any time the Depository shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation and a successor Depository is not appointed by Textron within 90 days after Textron receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, or (b) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and DTC requests the issuance of Securities in definitive registered form, Textron will execute, and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver, Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in denomination of $2,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000 (such denominations referred to herein as "authorized denominations"), of like tenor and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security in exchange for this Global Security. In addition, Textron may at any time determine that the Securities evidenced hereby shall no longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event Textron will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination by Textron, will authenticate and deliver Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and of like tenor and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of this Global Security in exchange for this Global Security. Upon the exchange of this Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form, without coupons, in authorized denominations, this Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for this Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
All terms used in this Global Security that are defined in the Indenture and not herein otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein) with respect to the Notes of a series, unless Textron has exercised its right to redeem the Notes of such series pursuant to paragraph (g) hereof, each Holder of the Notes of such series will have the right to require Textron to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes as
 
 
provided herein (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment").

EXHIBIT 5.1
 
September 17, 2009
 
Textron Inc.
40 Westminster Street
Providence, Rhode Island 02903
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel for Textron Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $35
0,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.20% Notes due 2015 and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.25% Notes due 2019 (collectively, the "Notes") pursuant to the
Underwriting Agreement dated September 14, 2009 between the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters") and the Company (the "Agreement"). The Notes are being issued under the Indenture dated as of September 10, 1999 between The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the Company (including the form and terms of the Notes established in the Officers' Certificate of the Company dated the date hereof pursuant to Section 3.1 thereof, the "Indenture").
 
We have reviewed (a) the Agreement, (b) the Indenture, (c) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152562) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company to register the Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and (d) the Prospectus dated July 28, 2008, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated September 14, 2009, relating to the offer and sale of the Notes (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus") filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Act. We have also reviewed such other agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials, and have satisfied ourselves as to such other matters, as we have considered relevant or necessary as a basis for this opinion.
 
In such review, we have assumed the accuracy and completeness of all agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials submitted to us, the conformity with the originals of all such materials submitted to us as copies (whether or not certified and including facsimiles), the authenticity of the originals of such materials and all materials submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the
 
legal capacity of all natural persons. In delivering this opinion, we have relied, without independent verification, as to factual matters, on certificates and other written or oral statements of governmental and other public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, the Underwriters and the Trustee.
 
On the basis of the assumptions and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes
constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Company e
nforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be subject to and limited by the effect of (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (b) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (c) requirements of reasonableness, good faith, materiality and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any matter may be brought.
 
This opinion is limited to the law of the State of New York and the Delaware General Corporation Law, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Commission on the date hereof and the incorporation thereof in the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the captions "Legal Opinions" and "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
 
Very truly yours,
 
/s/ Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP
