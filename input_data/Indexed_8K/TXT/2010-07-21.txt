99.1                      Press release dated July 21, 2010 related to earnings.
 
 
 
 

 Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) today reported second quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.27 per share, compared to a $0.23 per share loss in last years second quarter.  Excluding special charges, the company reported income from continuing operations of $0.29 per share, compared to $0.08 per share a year ago. Revenues in the quarter were $2.7 billion, up 3.7 percent from last years second quarter and manufacturing operations generated $170 million in free cash flow during the quarter.
Providence, Rhode Island  July 21, 2010
Solid manufacturing performance in the quarter reflected our lower cost structure, good operational execution and the ramp-up in our military programs at Bell, said Textron President and CEO Scott C. Donnelly
Furthermore, we continued to execute our finance receivable reduction plan, reducing managed receivables by $674 million during the quarter, Donnelly added.
Outlook
Donnelly remarked, Our sustained focus on operating productivity and ongoing investments in our businesses should position us well for this cycle.
Textron is increasing its forecast of 2010 earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special charges to $0.55 to $0.65 from $0.30 to $0.50, while maintaining its outlook for free cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group in the range of $500 - $550 million. The company also now expects 2010 finance receivables liquidations will be $2.0 billion, up from its previous target of $1.8 billion.
 
 
 
Second Q Segment Results
uarter
Cessna
 
Cessnas revenues decreased $236 million in the second quarter, primarily reflecting lower new aircraft deliveries, including 43 jets compared with 84 jets in the corresponding period last year.  These decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket and used aircraft volumes.
 
Segment profit decreased $45 million due to the lower volume and a reduction in deposit forfeiture income, partially offset by lower used aircraft write-downs, inventory reserves and selling and administrative expenses.
 
Cessna backlog ended the second quarter at $3.7 billion, down $400 million from the end of the first quarter.
 
Bell
 
Bells revenues increased $153 million in the second quarter, reflecting higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries and higher spares and support volume, partially offset by lower commercial aircraft volume.
 
Segment profit increased $36 million due to improved performance, higher military volume and commercial aircraft pricing in excess of inflation.  The improved performance reflects recognition of expected reimbursements for prior-period H-1 and V-22 program costs and the non-recurrence of costs related to the termination of certain commercial models in 2009.
 
Bell backlog increased $200 million from the end of first quarter to $7.1 billion.
 
Textron Systems
Revenues increased $57 million primarily due to higher Unmanned Aircraft Systems volume.
Segment profit increased $15 million due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance.
Textron Systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $200 million from the end of the first quarter.
 
Industrial
Revenues increased $153 million due to higher volumes, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Segment profit increased $39 million due to higher volumes and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation.
 
Finance
Finance revenues decreased $30 million largely due to the non-recurrence of last years gains on debt extinguishment and lower average finance receivables, partially offset by reduced portfolio losses.
Finance segment loss improved $28 million reflecting lower loan loss provisions, portfolio losses and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment and the impact of lower average finance receivables.
Since the end of last quarter, sixty-day plus delinquencies of finance receivables held for investment decreased to $385 million from $515 million and nonaccrual finance receivables decreased to $876 million from $1.03 billion.  Net charge-offs in the second quarter were $57 million compared with $31 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Managed receivables ended the second quarter at $5.6 billion, down from $6.3 billion at the end of last quarter.
 
Non-GAAP Measures
Income from continuing operations, excluding special charges and manufacturing free cash flow are non-GAAP measures that are defined and reconciled to GAAP in attachments to this release.

Manufacturing Free Cash Flow GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation:
 
 
Free cash flow is a measure generally used by investors, analysts and management to gauge a companys ability to generate cash from operations in excess of that necessary to be reinvested to sustain and grow the business.  Our definition of Manufacturing free cash flow uses net cash from operating activities of continuing operations, less dividends received from TFC, capital contributions provided under the Support Agreement and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of plant, property and equipment.  We believe that our Manufacturing free cash flow calculation provides a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to fund operations.  This measure is not a financial measure under GAAP and should be used in conjunction with GAAP cash measures provided in our C onsolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Our Manufacturing free cash flow measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, as there is no definitive accounting standard on how the measure should be calculated.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A reconciliation of income from continuing operations, excluding special charges, per share on a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis to income (loss) from continuing operations per share in accordance with GAAP is provided below.
Income from continuing operations, excluding special charges, on a per share basis is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Special charges include items that are either isolated or temporary in nature and are excluded from segment profit. Results before special charges are also the basis for measuring operating performance for management compensation purposes. It is helpful to understand results without these charges, especially when comparing results to previous periods.  However, analysis of the companys results before special charges should be used only in conjunction with data presented in accordance with GAAP.
For the three- and six-month periods ended July 4, 2009, Income (loss) from continuing operations  GAAP and the non-GAAP per share information are calculated using basic shares outstanding due to the anti-dilutive impact of the loss from continuing operations.
