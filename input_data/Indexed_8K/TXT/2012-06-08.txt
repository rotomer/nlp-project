On June 4, 2012, John D. Butler, the Executive Vice President Administration and Chief Human Resources Officer of Textron Inc. (the "Company") notified the Company that he has elected to retire, effective on or about July 1, 2012.
 
Because Mr. Butler has timed his retirement to accommodate the Company's succession plan for his position, in addition to receiving benefits provided under his employment agreement, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Butler pursuant to which the Company has agreed to pay to Mr. Butler the current value of certain benefits as if his retirement were to occur on December 31, 2012.
 
The letter agreement provides that Mr. Butler's short-term incentive compensation and long-term incentive awards shall be paid as if he retired at December 31, 2012, provided that the calculation of the incremental value of any such awards for the period following July 1, 2012  shall be determined as follows: (i) for stock-based awards, the value will be based upon the closing stock price on July 1, 2012, (ii) for performance share units, the value will be based upon performance through December 31, 2011 and (iii) for short-term incentive awards, the value will be based upon the target annual incentive compensation for 2012.  These provisions are expected to result in payment to Mr. Butler of a special one-time lump-sum amount of approximately $630,000 (based upon an assumed stock price of $25.00 per share) to be paid on or about January 31, 2013.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
