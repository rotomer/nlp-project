On November 16, 2012, in an arbitration proceeding initiated by Avcorp Industries, Inc. against Cessna Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of Textron Inc., an arbitral panel entered a final award against Cessna in the amount of approximately $27.4 million.  The dispute related to an alleged breach of a supply agreement under which Avcorp made various components for Cessna aircraft.  Although Cessna plans to vigorously contest this award, Textron will record a pretax charge of $27.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2012.  This charge will negatively impact the company's fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.06 per share.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
