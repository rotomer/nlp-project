EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TYCO APPOINTS EDWARD D. BREEN CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FORMER PRESIDENT AND COO OF MOTOROLA BRINGS OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE AND TRACK RECORD AS BUILDER OF GLOBAL MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE COMPANIES PEMBROKE, BERMUDA - JULY 25, 2002 - Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE - TYC, BSX-TTYI) today announced that the Board of Directors has appointed Edward D. Breen, the former President and Chief Operating Officer of Motorola, Inc., as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. John F. Fort, Lead Director of Tyco, said, "The appointment of Ed Breen as Chairman and CEO is a defining moment for Tyco. Ed has a superb record of tackling very difficult and complex business challenges, creating effective strategies and methodically executing on his plans. Over the years he has delivered consistently strong results while demanding the highest standards of corporate conduct. He developed General Instrument into an industry leader in cable and satellite equipment manufacturing and then played a key role in leading Motorola back to profitability. Ed has a well-earned reputation for making the right decisions quickly with a no-nonsense management style and a sharp focus on the interests of investors, customers and employees. Equally important, his personal and professional integrity are unassailable." Mr. Fort continued, "From the beginning of our search, initiated only five weeks ago, our Board was determined to select a world-caliber executive with global experience and unparalleled leadership qualities. We have accomplished that goal. Ed has built businesses on an international scale and demonstrated that he knows how to create lasting value in the companies that he runs. We considered many highly qualified candidates for this position. Ed Breen, we concluded, is the ideal CEO to restore investor confidence, enhance employee morale and build on the strengths of our operating businesses." Mr. Breen said, "This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I could not be more excited about leading this great company, with its strong businesses and market-leading positions. Tyco and its employees have successfully weathered a very difficult few months, and I am confident that we will put the current issues behind us and begin to forge ahead. All of us at Tyco have a tremendous opportunity to build on the Company's operating strengths to realize the true value of this enterprise. "Over the coming weeks," Mr. Breen added, "I will develop a specific action plan for the Company that will address four top priorities: restore confidence in Tyco with our employees, suppliers, customers and the financial community; enhance and strengthen the core businesses; ensure that we have the highest standards of corporate governance in place; and create value for shareholders."
