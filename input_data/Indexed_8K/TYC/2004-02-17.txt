ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
        As reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 22, 2004, on January 22, 2004, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was notified that the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, had determined to propose Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent auditors for fiscal year 2004. Upon that notification, PricewaterhouseCoopers submitted its resignation in accordance with the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP agreed to perform the review of the Company's interim financial statements for the quarter ending December 31, 2003 and therefore the resignation would not become effective until the filing of the Company's Form 10-Q for that period. Accordingly, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Company's independent accountants, effective upon the filing of the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ending December 31, 2003, until the 2004 annual general meeting of shareholders scheduled for March 25, 2004. The shareholders will be asked at the 2004 annual general meeting to appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent auditors for fiscal year 2004.
        The Company, with the approval of its Audit Committee, intends to continue to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide certain non-audit services to the Company during the year ending September 30, 2004.
        On February 17, 2004, the Company filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. Consequently, the resignation of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as well as the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP, became effective on February 17, 2004.
        PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's audit reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were the reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
        During the years ended September 30, 2002 and 2003 and the subsequent interim period through February 17, 2004, there were no disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures which disagreements, if not resolved to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's satisfaction, would have caused PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its audit reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years, and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
        The Company provided PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and requested that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP agreed with the above statements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP furnished such a letter, dated February 17, 2004, and a copy is attached as Exhibit 16.1.
        During the years ended September 30, 2002 and 2003 and through February 17, 2004, the Company did not consult Deloitte & Touche LLP with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
