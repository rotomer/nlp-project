Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        PEMBROKE, BermudaSept. 23, 2004Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC; BSX: TYC) Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David FitzPatrick will speak at Prudential Equity Group's 'Inside Our Best Ideas' seminar today in Mount Snow, Vt. FitzPatrick's presentation materials will be available for viewing on the company's website at
www.tyco.com
.
        At the conference, FitzPatrick will present an overview of Tyco's businesses and confirm earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. The company expects EPS of $0.41 to $0.43 for the fourth quarter and $1.61 to $1.63 for the full year. This EPS outlook excludes the impact from the restructuring and divestiture programs announced in November 2003 and any charges relating to early retirement of debt. The company expects cash flow from operating activities to be $5.2 billion and free cash flow to be $4.7 billion. Both cash flow estimates are before voluntary pension contributions.
        Tyco International Ltd. is a global, diversified company that provides vital products and services to customers in five business segments: Fire & Security, Electronics, Healthcare, Engineered Products & Services, and Plastics & Adhesives. With 2003 revenue of $37 billion, Tyco employs 260,000 people worldwide. More information on Tyco can be found at

NON-GAAP MEASURES
        
"EPS excluding charges", "cash flow excluding voluntary pension contributions," "and "free cash flow" (FCF) are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.
        
The company has forecast its EPS results excluding restructuring and divestiture charges and charges relating to early retirement of debt to give investors additional perspective on the underlying business results. Because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of divestitures, restructurings or debt retirement and the associated charges or gains that will be taken, it is difficult to accurately include the impact of those items in the forecast. The company has forecast its cash flow results excluding any voluntary pension contribution because it has not yet made a determination about the amount and timing of any such contribution.
        
The difference between Cash Flows from Operating Activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non- GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows that the company believes are useful to identify. FCF permits management and an investor to gain insight into the number that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. It is also a significant component in the company's incentive compensation plans. The difference reflects the impact from:
 - 
the sale of accounts receivable programs,
 - 
net capital expenditures,
 - 
construction of the Tyco Global Network (TGN),
 - 
acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program),
 - 
cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn-out liabilities and
 - 
dividends paid
        
The impact from the sale of accounts receivable programs is added or subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Capital expenditures, construction of the TGN, the ADT dealer program and dividends are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn-out liabilities is subtracted from Cash Flow from Operating Activities because these cash outflows are not available for general corporate uses.
        
The limitation associated with using FCF is that it subtracts cash items that are ultimately within management and the Board's discretion to direct and that therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure. This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.
        
FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to read the company's financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
