Item 5.03.    Change in Fiscal Year
        On November 4, 2004, the Board of Directors of Tyco International Ltd. (the "Company") approved the change in the Company's fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52-53 week" year ending on the Friday nearest September 30, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. Once every seven years, starting in 2011, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks. In addition, certain of the Company's subsidiaries have consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Company's fiscal period end. The Company plans to report results for these subsidiaries using the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. While the expected holiday-related slow-down in certain customer sales is expected to shift from the second fiscal quarter to the first fiscal quarter, the impact of this change is not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. This change is also consistent with the Company's ongoing efforts to enhance controls and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns its external reporting with its internal operational processes. This change will be effective for the Company's first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004. The results for the transition period related to this change will be reported as an adjustment within Shareholders' Equity. No transition report is required for these changes.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: November 9, 2004
