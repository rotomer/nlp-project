Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
        On December 16, 2004, Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. (the "Company"), and the Company, as the parent guarantor, entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2004, with Bank of America, N.A., as Paying Agent, Co-Administrative Agent and lender, Citicorp USA, Inc., as Co-Administrative Agent and lender, and the other financial institutions party thereto (the "Five-Year Credit Agreement").
        The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaces TIGSA's $1.0 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2003, among TIGSA, as the borrower, the Company, as the parent guarantor, Bank of America, N.A. and Citicorp North America, Inc., as Co-Administrative Agents and lenders, and the other financial institutions party thereto (the "364-Day Credit Agreement"), which was terminated on December 16, 2004 prior to its scheduled expiration date of December 20, 2004. There were no amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Credit Agreement on the date of its termination and no early termination penalties were incurred by TIGSA.
        The Five-Year Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, of which the entire amount is currently undrawn and available. The Company has provided an unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of TIGSA's obligations under the Credit Agreement. Amounts under the Five-Year Credit Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed by TIGSA from time to time until the maturity of the revolving credit facility on December 16, 2009. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions under the Five-Year Credit Agreement are permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which will be, at TIGSA's option, either the British Bankers Association LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of TIGSA, or a base rate.
        The Five-Year Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the incurrence of liens, a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and minimum levels of net worth. The Five-Year Credit Agreement includes customary events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest rate on all outstanding obligations will be increased and payment of all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Five-Year Credit Agreement shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments will automatically terminate.
        Also on December 16, 2004, TIGSA, as the borrower, and the Company, as the parent guarantor, entered into an amendment to the Three-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2003, with Bank of America, N.A., as Paying Agent and lender, and the other financial institutions party thereto (the "Amendment"). The Amendment provides for changes to conform certain provisions of the Three-Year Credit Agreement to the provisions of the Five-Year Credit Agreement, including, among other things, the elimination of the covenant that limits the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to make substantial payments in connection with their capital shares, a modification to the liens covenant to permit unlimited liens securing certain non-recourse debt, the elimination of step-ups in the minimum levels of net worth for net proceeds from stock issuances, and the elimination of certain conditions to borrowings under the Three-Year Credit Agreement.
        Some of the financial institutions party to the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the Amendment and the 364-Day Credit Agreement have or may have had various relationships with the Company and its affiliates involving the provision of a variety of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, pension fund and equipment financing and leasing services, and the issuance of
letters of credit and bank guarantees. In addition, the Company and certain affiliates have entered into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative arrangements with some of the financial institutions.
        The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the Amendment, and reference is made to the complete text of these agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively.

If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans.
        (v)   If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
        (b)   (i) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Paying Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its
pro rata
share of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Paying Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding subsection.
        (ii)   Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan constituting part of a Borrowing available to the Paying Agent in immediately available funds at the Paying Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice.
        (iii)  Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
(and, if such Borrowing is the initial Borrowing,
Section 4.01)
, the Paying Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Paying Agent either by (A) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (B) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Paying Agent by the Borrower.
        (c)   (i) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan.
        (ii)   During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.
        (d)   The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Paying Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Paying Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.
        (e)   After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Loans.
        
2.03    Prepayments.
        (a)   (i) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Paying Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay the Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;
provided
that (A) such notice must be received by the Paying Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (1) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; and (B) any prepayment of Loans of either Type shall be in a principal amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or, if less, the then aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans of such Type.
        (ii)   Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. The Paying Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's pro rata share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
        (iii)  Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05.
Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages.
        (b)   If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.
        
2.04    Termination or Reduction of Commitments.
    (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Paying Agent, terminate the Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Paying Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial
reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or, if less, the then Aggregate Commitments, and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments.
        (b)   The Paying Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments.
        (c)   Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Commitment Percentage.
        (d)   All facility fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.
        
2.05    Repayment of Loans.
    The Borrower agrees to repay in full to the Paying Agent for the account of the Lenders, on the Termination Date, the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding on such date.
        
2.06    Interest.
        (a)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period relating thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period
plus
the Applicable Margin, and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate.
        (b)   If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Financing Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore, while any Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
        (c)   Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
        
2.07    Fees.
    (a)
Facility Fee.
    The Borrower shall pay to the Paying Agent, for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Commitment Percentage, a facility fee at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate
times
the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments as reduced from time to time pursuant to
Section 2.04
(or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Loans), regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Loans remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in
Article IV
is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Termination Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand).
        (b)   
Other Fees.
  (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arrangers and the Paying Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
        (ii)   The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
        
2.08    Computation of Interest and Fees.
    All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,
provided
that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.10(a)
, bear interest for one day.
        
2.09    Evidence of Debt.
        The Borrowings made by the Borrower shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by each Lender making Loans under those Borrowings and by the Paying Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Paying Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Borrowings made by the Borrower from the Lenders and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Paying Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Paying Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Paying Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Paying Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
        
2.10    Payments Generally.
        (a)   All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Paying Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Paying Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Paying Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Paying Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue;
provided
that payment shall be deemed received by 2:00 p.m. if the Borrower provides the Paying Agent with written confirmation of a Federal Reserve Bank reference number no later than 4:00 p.m. on such Business Day.
        (b)   If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
        (c)   Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Paying Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Paying Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Paying Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not
be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Paying Agent in immediately available funds, then:
        (i)    if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Paying Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Paying Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Paying Agent in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and
        (ii)   if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Paying Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Paying Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Paying Agent (the "
Compensation Period
") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Paying Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Paying Agent's demand therefor, the Paying Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Paying Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Paying Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
        A notice of the Paying Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
        (d)   If any Lender makes available to the Paying Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
Article II
, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Paying Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowings set forth in
Article IV
are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Paying Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
        (e)   The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan.
        (f)    Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
        
2.11    Sharing of Payments.
    If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Paying Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans
pro rata
with each of them;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section 10.06
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to
Section 10.09
) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Paying Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.
        
3.01    Taxes.
        (a)   Any and all payments by each Principal Obligor to or for the account of the Paying Agent or any Lender under any Financing Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding
, in the case of the Paying Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Paying Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains an Applicable Lending Office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "
Taxes
"). If either Principal Obligor shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Financing Document to the Paying Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), each of the Paying Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Principal Obligor shall make such deductions, (iii) such Principal Obligor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, such Principal Obligor shall furnish to the Paying Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
        (b)   In addition, each Principal Obligor agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Financing Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Financing Document (hereinafter referred to as "
Other Taxes
").
        (c)   Each Principal Obligor agrees to indemnify the Paying Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Paying Agent and such Lender with respect to any sum payable under any Financing Document and (ii) any liability (including additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this subsection (c) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Paying Agent makes a demand therefor.
        (d)   If either Principal Obligor is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this
Section 3.01
, then such Lender will change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Lender in the good faith exercise of its discretion, is not otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
        (e)   The Paying Agent and each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to promptly furnish to a Principal Obligor properly completed and executed copies of such forms as such Principal Obligor may reasonably request in connection with Taxes imposed with respect to sums payable under any Financing Document to the Paying Agent or Lender (as the case may be),
provided
that nothing in this
Section 3.01(e)
shall require the Paying Agent or any Lender to disclose any confidential or proprietary information.
        
3.02    Illegality.
    If, after the date of this Agreement, any Lender determines in its reasonable judgment that the adoption of, or any change in or in the interpretation or administration of, any applicable Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Paying Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Paying Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Paying Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
        
3.03    Inability to Determine Rates.
    If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Paying Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Paying Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
        
3.04    Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
        (a)   If, after the date of this Agreement, any Lender determines in its reasonable judgment that the adoption of, or any change in or in the interpretation or administration of, any applicable Law, or such Lender's compliance therewith, has resulted in an increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which
Section 3.01
shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of
either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by
Section 3.04(c))
, then from time to time within 30 days of demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Paying Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
        (b)   If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time within 30 days of demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Paying Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
        (c)   The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided
the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Paying Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.
        (d)   Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date of this Agreement, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this
Section 3.04
;
provided
that (i) if any Lender fails to give such notice within 90 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event (or, in the exercise of ordinary due diligence, should have obtained actual knowledge thereof), such Lender shall only be entitled to payment under this
Section 3.04
for costs incurred from and after the date 90 days prior to the date that such Lender does give such notice and (ii) each such Lender will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender in the good faith exercise of its discretion, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
        
3.05    Funding Losses.
    Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Paying Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
        (a)   any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or
        (b)   any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to comply with its obligation to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower;
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this
Section 3.05
, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
        
3.06    Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation.
    Any Lender or Agent claiming compensation under this
Article III
shall deliver to the Paying Agent, who shall deliver to the Borrower contemporaneously with the demand for payment a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of any additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the basis used to determine such amounts and such certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Paying Agent or such Lender will use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
        
3.07    Survival.
    All of the Borrower's obligations under this
Article III
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.
        
3.08    Substitution of Lender.
    If any Lender (i) has demanded compensation for increased costs pursuant to
Section 3.01
or
3.04
or is entitled to payments under
Section 3.04(a)
or (ii) has determined that the making or maintaining of any Eurodollar Rate Loan has become unlawful or impossible pursuant to
Section 3.02
and similar additional interest or compensation has not been demanded by, or a similar determination has not been made by, all of the Lenders, the Borrower shall have the right to designate an assignee which is not an Affiliate of the Borrower to purchase for cash, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption, the outstanding Loans and Commitment of such Lender and to assume all of such Lender's other rights and obligations hereunder without recourse to or representation or warranty by, or expense to, such Lender (other than as set forth in the Assignment and Assumption), for a purchase price equal to (A) the outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Loan plus (B) any accrued but unpaid interest thereon plus (C) the accrued but unpaid fees in respect of such Lender's Commitment plus (D) such amount, if any, as would be payable pursuant to
Section 3.05
if the Loan of such Lender were prepaid in full on the date of consummation of such assignment plus (E) any other amounts due and payable to such Lender hereunder.
        
4.01    Conditions to Effectiveness.
    This Agreement shall become effective on the date that each of the following conditions shall have been satisfied (or waived in accordance with
Section 10.01)
:
        (a)   The Paying Agent's receipt of the following, each of which shall be originals, electronic copies or facsimiles (followed promptly by originals) unless otherwise specified, each properly executed by a Responsible Officer of the signing Obligor, each dated the Closing Date (or, in the case of certificates of governmental officials, a recent date before the Closing Date) and each in form and substance satisfactory to the Paying Agent, the Lenders and their respective legal counsel:
        (i)    executed counterparts of this Agreement, sufficient in number for distribution to the Paying Agent, each Lender and the Borrower;

        (iv)  a favorable opinion of each of (i) the general counsel of the Parent, substantially in the form of

4.02    Conditions to all Borrowings.
    The obligation of each Lender to honor any Request for Borrowing (other than a Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans) is subject to the following conditions precedent:
        (a)   The representations and warranties of the Borrower and each other Obligor contained in
Article V

        Each Principal Obligor represents and warrants to the Paying Agent and the Lenders that:
        
5.01    Corporate Existence and Power.
    Each Principal Obligor is a company duly organized or formed and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation. Each Principal Obligor has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except to the extent that failure to have any such power or governmental license, authorization, consent or approval could not, based upon the facts and circumstances in existence at the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        
5.02    Corporate and Governmental Authorization; No Contravention.
    The execution, delivery and performance by each Principal Obligor of this Agreement and by the Borrower of the Notes: (a) are within its corporate or, if applicable, partnership, powers; (b) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or, if applicable, partnership, action on its part; (c) require no license, consent, approval or other action by or in respect of, or filing or registration with, any governmental body, agency or official, in each case, on its part; and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) its Organization Documents, (iii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Debt of such Principal Obligor, except for any contravention or default under any such agreement or instrument evidencing or governing such Debt in an aggregate principal amount, individually or in the aggregate for all such agreements or instruments in respect of which there is a contravention or default, not in excess of $25,000,000; or (iv) any other material agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon such Principal Obligor.
        
5.03    Binding Effect.
    This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of such Principal Obligor and each Note, when executed and delivered in accordance with this Agreement, will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, in each case enforceable against such Principal Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally or (ii) general principles of equity.
        
5.04    Financial Information.
    (a) The consolidated balance sheet of the Parent and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, reported on by Deloitte & Touche LLP and set forth in the Parent's 2004 Form 10-K, a copy of which has been delivered to each of the Lenders, fairly present, in conformity with GAAP, the consolidated financial position of the Parent and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such period.
        (b)   Since September 30, 2004 there has been no Material Adverse Change.
        
5.05    Litigation.
    There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending against, or to the knowledge of the Parent threatened against or affecting, the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official (a) in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could, based upon the facts and circumstances in existence at
the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in the Parent's filings of Forms 10K, 10Q or 8K on or before the date hereof or as set forth in
Schedule 5.05
(the "
Existing Litigation
"), and except for shareholders' derivative litigation or shareholders' class actions based on the same facts and circumstances as the Existing Litigation, or (b) which in any manner draws into question the validity or enforceability of any of the Financing Documents.
        
5.06    Compliance with ERISA.
    Each member of the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance, except where the failure to so comply could not, based upon the facts and circumstances in existence at the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan. No member of the ERISA Group has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed to make any required contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan, or made any amendment to any Plan, which has resulted in or could, based upon the facts and circumstances in existence at the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a Lien or the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA or the Code or (iii) incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA), which could, based upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        
5.07    Environmental Matters.
    In the ordinary course of its business, the Parent conducts reviews of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of operations conducted thereat, any costs or liabilities in connection with off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Substances, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses). On the basis of this review, the Parent has reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, could not, based upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        
5.08    Insurance.
    The properties of each Principal Obligor and its Subsidiaries are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as are customarily carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where such Principal Obligor or Subsidiary operates.
        
5.09    Taxes.
    The Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries have filed all material tax returns which are required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes shown on such returns or pursuant to any material assessment received by the Parent or any Significant Subsidiary, except those assessments which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Parent and its Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Parent, adequate.
        
5.10    Subsidiaries.
    Each of the Parent's Consolidated Subsidiaries is duly organized or formed, validly existing and (to the extent such concept is applicable to it) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation, except (i) where the failure to be so organized, existing or
in good standing could not, based upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) as a result of a transaction permitted by
Section 6.10
. Each such Subsidiary has all legal powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except to the extent that failure to have any such power or governmental license, authorization, consent or approval could not, based upon the facts and circumstances in existence at the time this representation and warranty is made or deemed made, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        
5.11    Not an Investment Company or Public Utility Holding Company.
    Neither Principal Obligor is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" thereof, within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.
        
5.12    Margin Regulations.
    Neither Principal Obligor is engaged principally or as one of its important activities in the business of buying or carrying margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the FRB, and no part of the proceeds of any extension of credit hereunder will be used for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any such margin stock.
        
5.13    Full Disclosure.
    All information heretofore furnished by or on behalf of the Obligors to the Paying Agent in connection with this Agreement does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading on the date when made;
provided
that with respect to projections, the Principal Obligors represent and warrant only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time made, it being understood that projections are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of the Principal Obligors and that no assurance can be given that such projections will be realized.
        
5.14    Ownership of Property; Liens.
    Each of the Parent and each Consolidated Subsidiary has good record and marketable title in fee simple to, or valid leasehold interests in, all real property necessary or used in the ordinary conduct of its business, except for such defects in title as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The property of the Parent and its Subsidiaries is subject to no Liens, other than Liens permitted by
Section 6.09
.
        
5.15    Obligations to Be Pari Passu.
    The obligations of each Principal Obligor under this Agreement rank
pari passu
as to priority of payment and in all other respects with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of such Principal Obligor.
        
5.16    Tax Shelter Regulations.
    Each Principal Obligor does not intend to treat the Loans as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event such Principal Obligor determines to take any action inconsistent with such intention, it will promptly notify the Paying Agent thereof. If a Principal Obligor so notifies the Paying Agent, such Principal Obligor acknowledges that one or more of the Lenders may treat its Loans as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury Regulation Section 301.6112-1, and such Lender or Lenders, as applicable, will maintain the lists and other records required by such Treasury Regulation.
        The Parent agrees that so long as any Lender has any Commitment hereunder, or any amount payable under this Agreement or any Note remains unpaid:
        
6.01

        (g)   promptly following, and in any event within 10 days of, any change in the Moody's Rating or the S&P Rating, notice thereof; and

        (b)   The Parent will maintain, and will cause each Subsidiary to maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to its assets and business against such casualties and contingencies, of such types (including, without limitation, loss or damage, product liability, business interruption, larceny, embezzlement or other criminal misappropriation) and in such amounts as is customary in the case of similarly situated corporations of established reputations engaged in the same or a similar business, unless the failure to maintain such insurance could not, based upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

, such failure could not, based upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
provided
that nothing in this
Section 6.04
shall prohibit (A) the merger or consolidation of a Subsidiary (other than the Borrower) with or into the Parent or a Wholly-Owned Consolidated Subsidiary, (B) the merger or consolidation of a Significant Subsidiary (other than the Borrower) with or into a Person other than the Parent or a Wholly-Owned Consolidated Subsidiary, if the Person surviving such consolidation or merger is a Subsidiary and immediately after giving effect thereto, no Default shall

8.01
    
Appointment and Authorization of Paying Agent.
    
        Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Paying Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Financing Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Financing Document, the Paying Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Paying Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Financing Document or otherwise exist against the Paying Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Financing Documents with reference to the Paying Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under
agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
        
8.02
    
Delegation of Duties.
    The Paying Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Financing Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.

8.03
    
Liability of Paying Agent.
    No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Financing Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Obligor or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Financing Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Paying Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or for any failure of any Obligor or any other party to any Financing Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Obligor or any Affiliate thereof.
        
8.04
    
Reliance by Paying Agent.
    
        (a)   The Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Financing Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Paying Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Financing Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.
        (b)   For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in
Section 4.01
, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.
        
8.05
    
Notice of Default.
    The Paying Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Paying Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Paying Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The Paying Agent will
notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Paying Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Article VII
;
provided
,
however
, that unless and until the Paying Agent has received any such direction, the Paying Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.
        
8.06
    
Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Paying Agent.
    Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Paying Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Obligor or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Paying Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Obligors and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Financing Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Obligors. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Paying Agent herein, the Paying Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Obligors or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.
        
8.07
    
Indemnification of Paying Agent.
    Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Obligor and without limiting the obligation of any Obligor to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it;
provided
,
however
, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided
,
however
, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Paying Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Paying Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Financing Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Paying Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Paying Agent.

The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Obligor or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Obligor or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Paying Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.

Sections 2.07

       (vii)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, the Paying Agent, any Lender or any other Person, or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.

9.06
    
Stay of Acceleration.
    In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under any Financing Document is stayed upon insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the Parent hereunder forthwith on demand by the Required Lenders.

provided
that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Paying Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the Paying Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the Paying Agent unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Paying Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.

Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender, and the Note theretofore held by the assignor Lender shall be returned to the Borrower in exchange for a new Note, payable to the assignee Lender and reflecting its retained interest (if any) hereunder. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
        (c)   The Paying Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Paying Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Paying Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Paying Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

Sections 3.01

to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.09
as though it were a Lender,
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to
Sections 2.11
and
3.06
as though it were a Lender.
        (e)   A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 3.01
or

provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

provided
that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under
Section 3.04
), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Financing Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Paying Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.
        (i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities,
provided
that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 10.07
, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Financing Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Financing Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

Confidentiality.
    Each of the Paying Agent and the Lenders shall maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below) and shall not use the Information except for purposes relating directly to the Financing Documents and the credit facility contemplated hereby, except that Information may be disclosed by the Paying Agent and the Lenders (a) to their and their Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents whom they determine need to know such Information in connection with matters relating directly to the Financing Documents and the credit facility contemplated hereby, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential and the Paying Agent and Lenders, as appropriate, shall be responsible for breach of this Section by any of them), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or upon order of any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, to the extent required by such order and not effectively stayed on appeal or otherwise, or as otherwise required by law;
provided
that in the case of any intended disclosure under this clause (c), the recipient thereof shall (unless otherwise required by applicable law) give the Parent not less than five Business Days' prior notice (or such shorter period as may, in the good faith discretion of the recipient, be reasonable under the circumstances or may be required by any court or agency under the circumstances), specifying the Information involved and stating such recipient's intention to disclose such Information (including the manner and extent of such disclosure) in order to allow the Parent an opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Financing Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Financing Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section (and of which the Parent shall be a third party beneficiary), to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the written consent of the Borrower referencing this
Section 10.08
, or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, a breach of another confidentiality agreement to which the Paying Agent or such Lender is a party or any other legal or fiduciary obligation of the Paying Agent or such Lender or (y) becomes available to the Paying Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For purposes of this Section, "
Information
" means all information received from or on behalf of any Obligor relating to any Obligor or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that the Paying Agent or any Lender proves is available to the Paying Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Obligor from a source which is not, to the knowledge of the recipient, prohibited from disclosing such information by a confidentiality agreement or other legal or fiduciary obligation to the Obligors. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as
provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has taken normal and reasonable precautions and exercised due care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information. In addition to other remedies, the Obligors shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief for breach of this
Section 10.08
.
        
10.09
    
Set-off.
    In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Obligor, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Obligor) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Obligors against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Financing Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Paying Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Financing Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however
, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
        
10.10
    
Interest Rate Limitation.
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Financing Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Financing Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "
Maximum Rate
"). If the Paying Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Paying Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
        
10.11
    
Counterparts.
    This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
        
10.12
    
Integration.
    This Agreement, together with the other Financing Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Financing Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control;
provided
that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Paying Agent or the Lenders in any other Financing Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Financing Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.
        
10.13
    
Survival of Representations and Warranties.
    All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Financing Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Paying Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Paying Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Paying Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.
        
10.14
    
Severability.
    If any provision of this Agreement or the other Financing Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Dear Sirs,
We have acted as special legal advisers in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg (

With your consent, we have assumed and we have not verified independently:

2.10
that, in so far as any obligation under, or action to be taken under, the Opinion Documents is required to be performed or taken in any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg, the performance of such obligation or the taking of such action will constitute a valid and binding obligation of each of
the parties thereto under the laws of that jurisdiction and will not be illegal by virtue of the laws of that jurisdiction;
2.11
that there are no provisions of the laws of any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg which would adversely affect, or otherwise have any negative impact on, the opinions expressed in this legal opinion;
2.12
that all the parties to the Opinion Documents (other than the Company) are companies duly organized, incorporated and validly existing in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions of their respective incorporation and/or their place of effective management, having a corporate existence, that in respect of all the parties to the Opinion Documents, no steps have been taken pursuant to any insolvency proceedings to appoint an administrator, receiver or liquidator over the respective parties or their assets and that no voluntary winding-up of such parties has been recorded at the date hereof;

Subject to the assumptions made above and the qualifications set out below and to any matters not disclosed to us, we are of the opinion that under the laws of Luxembourg in effect, and as published, construed and applied by the Luxembourg courts, on the date hereof:
3.    Opinion
1.
The Company is a limited liability company (
socit anonyme
) duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Luxembourg for an unlimited duration, with corporate power and authority under the laws of Luxembourg to own and operate its properties and to enter into and perform its obligations under Credit Agreement and the Notes.
2.
The Company has all powers and material governmental licenses, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted (other than such powers or consents the failure of which to be obtained could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect).
3.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the respective Opinion Documents (i) are within the Company's powers, (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) require no action by or filing with any governmental body, agency or official, (iv) do not contravene or, constitute a default under (a) applicable law or regulation, (b) the Company's articles of association or (c) to our knowledge, any agreement or instrument governing debt of the Company or any other material agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the Company.
4.
The Opinion Documents constitute, subject to their validity, legality and enforceability under New York law by which they are expressed to be governed, valid and binding agreements of the Company.
5.
There is no action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened against or affecting the Company which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which in any manner draws into question the validity of the Opinion Documents.
6.
There is no tax, impost, deduction or withholding imposed by Luxembourg or any political subdivision thereof on or by virtue of the execution, delivery, performance (including the payment by the Company of interest or other amounts thereunder) or enforcement of the Opinion Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto.
7.
The Opinion Documents are in proper legal form under the laws of Luxembourg for the enforcement thereof against the Company under the laws of Luxembourg.
8.
To ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of the Opinion Documents in Luxembourg, it is not necessary that the Opinion Documents or any other document be filed or recorded with any court or other authority in Luxembourg.
9.
The choice of the laws of the State of New York to govern the Opinion Documents is a valid and binding choice of law and will be recognized, upheld and applied by the courts of Luxembourg.
10.
The provisions in the Opinion Documents for the submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States are valid and binding on the Company.
11.
Any judgment obtained in any federal or New York State court, arising out of or in relation to the obligations of the Company under the Opinion Documents, would be enforceable in Luxembourg against the Company.
12.
The obligations of the Company, as a borrower, under the Opinion Documents rank and will rank at least
pari passu
with all its other present and future unsecured indebtedness save those whose claims are preferred in accordance with any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other laws of general application.
13.
Under the laws of Luxembourg, neither the Paying Agent nor the Lenders will be deemed to be resident, domiciled, carrying on any commercial activity or subject to taxation in Luxembourg solely as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of the Opinion Documents.
14.
It is not necessary under the laws of Luxembourg that the Paying Agent or the Lenders be authorized or qualified to carry on business in Luxembourg (i) by reason of the execution of the Opinion Documents and (ii) in order to enable them to enforce their respective rights under the Opinion Documents.
15.
The Company is not entitled to claim immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process in the courts of Luxembourg, whether generally or in relation to any specific property.
16.
Subject to qualification 4.18 hereafter, service of process against the Company effected in the manner set forth in section 10.15 (c) of the Credit Agreement will be effective as valid service of process on the Company.
4.    Qualifications
        The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications.
4.1
Insolvency
The validity, legality, performance and enforceability of the Opinion Documents are subject to, and may be affected or limited by, the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, moratorium or reprieve from payment (
sursis de paiement
), controlled management (
gestion contrle
), general settlement or composition with creditors (
concordat prventif de faillite
),
fraudulent conveyance (
actio pauliana
), reorganization or similar Luxembourg or foreign laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
4.2
Corporate benefit
The Company may only validly enter into the Opinion Documents if and to the extent that such entry does not threaten its existence or the rights of its creditors and that the Company can reasonably hope to draw directly or indirectly a corporate benefit, at least in the long term, from the Opinion Documents. We have no indication and no reason to believe that entering the respective Opinion Documents would be other than for the corporate benefit of the Company.
4.3
Choice of law
The Luxembourg courts (assuming that litigation were brought to the Luxembourg courts and that Luxembourg courts had jurisdiction) would not apply a chosen foreign law if that choice was not made
bona fide
and/or if:
(i)
it were not pleaded and proven; or
(ii)
if pleaded and proven, such foreign law would be contrary to the mandatory rules of Luxembourg law or manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg public policy.
Were the Opinion Documents governed by Luxembourg law, none of their provisions would in substance be contrary to mandatory rules of Luxembourg law or manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg public policy, except as otherwise specifically referred to in this legal opinion.
4.4
Enforcement of judgments
The Luxembourg courts would enforce a final and conclusive judgment rendered by a court of the United States in any suit, action or proceedings with respect to the Opinion Documents and there would be no formal retrial or re-examination of the matters adjudicated; provided, however, that such judgment would have to comply with the conditions posed by article 678 of the Luxembourg
nouveau code de procdure civile
(i.e. the
exequatur
procedure) as currently interpreted by the Luxembourg courts and doctrine, which are as follows:
the foreign court judgement must be enforceable in the country of origin,
the court of origin must have had jurisdiction,
the foreign procedure must have been in compliance with the laws of the country of origin,
the foreign judgement must not violate the rights of the defendant to present a defense,
the foreign court must have applied the law which is designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (those conflict of law rules include application of the chosen foreign law under appropriate circumstances), or, at least, the judgement must not contravene the principles underlying these rules,
the rationale underlying the findings of the foreign judgement as well as the judgement as such must not contravene Luxembourg international public order, and
the foreign judgement must not have been rendered as a consequence of an evasion of mandatory provisions of Luxembourg law (
fraude  la loi
).
4.5
Enforcement of unlawful obligations
Where any obligations are to be performed or observed or are based upon a matter arising in a jurisdiction outside Luxembourg, they may not be enforceable under Luxembourg law if and to the extent that such performance or observance would be unlawful, unenforceable, or contrary to public policy under the laws of such jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foreign jurisdiction clause,
Luxembourg courts would have in principle jurisdiction for any conservatory or provisional action in connection with assets located in Luxembourg and such action would most likely be governed by Luxembourg law.
4.6
Concurrent proceedings
The provisions whereby the taking of proceedings in one or more jurisdictions shall not preclude the taking of proceedings in any other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not, might not be entirely enforceable in a Luxembourg court. If proceedings were previously commenced between the same parties and on the same grounds as the proceedings in Luxembourg, a plea of pendency might be raised in the Luxembourg court and proceedings either stayed pending the termination of the proceedings abroad or dismissed, as the case may be.
4.7
Judgment currency
Any judgement awarded in the courts of Luxembourg may be expressed in a currency other than the euro. However, any obligation to pay a sum of money in any currency other than the euro will be enforceable in Luxembourg in terms of the euro only and any loss incurred as a result of a currency exchange fluctuation can be recovered under Luxembourg law.
4.8
Binding Documents
The opinion expressed under 3.(iv)(c) is solely based upon a review of documents which have been filed by the Company with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register and the Certificate.
4.9
Litigation
The opinion expressed under 5. above is solely based upon oral information received from the registrar of the district court of Luxembourg and upon the Certificate.
4.10
Penalty clauses
It is possible that a Luxembourg court (if having jurisdiction) would consider for instance Section 3.04 of the Credit Agreement whereby the Company may be obliged to pay additional interest on the related Eurodollar Rate Loan at a rate
per annum
determined by the relevant Lender as a penalty clause (
clause pnale
).
Penalty clauses (
clauses pnales
), and similar clauses on damages or liquidated damages, as governed by article 1152 and articles 1226
et seq.
of the Luxembourg civil code are allowed to the extent that they provide for a reasonable level of damages. The Luxembourg judge (if competent) has however the right to reduce (or increase) the amount thereof if it is unreasonably high (or low). The provisions of article 1152 and articles 1226
et seq.
of the civil code are generally considered to be a point of public policy under Luxembourg law. It is possible that a Luxembourg court would consider them to be a point of international public policy that would set aside the relevant foreign governing law.
4.11
Interest on interest
Interest may not accrue on interest that is due on capital, unless such interest has been due for at least one year (
article 1154 of the civil code
). The right to compound interest is limited to cases where (x) the interest has been due for at least one year and (y) the parties have specifically provided in an agreement (to be made after that interest has become due for at least one year) that such interest may be compounded (or absent such agreement, the creditor may file an appropriate request with the relevant court). The provisions of article 1154 of the civil code are generally considered to be a point of public policy under Luxembourg law. It is possible, although it is highly unlikely, that a Luxembourg court would consider them to be a point of international public policy that would set aside the relevant foreign governing law.
4.12
Interest after judgement
No opinion is expressed as to the validity and enforceability of provisions whereby interest on overdue amounts or other payment obligations shall continue to accrue or subsist after judgement.
4.13
Registration and Translation
The registration of the Opinion Documents in Luxembourg and any documents mentioned therein or connected therewith may become necessary, if and when they are referred to or used in a Luxembourg public deed and Luxembourg courts or an official Luxembourg authority may require the prior registration of the Opinion Documents (or any document in connection therewith) in Luxembourg, if they were to be produced in a Luxembourg court action or exhibited before an official Luxembourg authority.
If the registration of the Opinion Documents (or any document in connection therewith) with the
Administration de l'Enregistrement et des Domaines
in Luxembourg is required either a nominal registration duty or an
ad valorem
duty will be payable, depending on the nature of the document subject to registration (e.g., an
ad valorem
duty of 0.24 (zero point twenty-four)
per
cent. will be payable on the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in a loan document, such as the Credit Agreement, so registered). If registration is so required, the Luxembourg courts or the official authority may require that the Opinion Documents (or any documents in connection therewith) and/or any judgement (or any documents in connection therewith) obtained in the courts other than the courts of Luxembourg must be translated into French or German.
In our experience it is unlikely that registration of the Opinion Documents will be required by Luxembourg courts or official authorities. However, if such registration were required, it cannot entirely be excluded that an
ad valorem
duty of 0.24 (zero point twenty-four)
per
cent. of the payment obligation expressed under the Opinion Documents will be due.
4.14
Specific performance
Certain obligations may not be the subject of specific performance pursuant to judgements, but may result only in damages. Accordingly, Luxembourg courts may issue an award of damages where specific performance is deemed impracticable or an award of damages is determined adequate.
4.15
Conclusive certificates
Any certificate or determination which would by contract be deemed to be conclusive may not be upheld by the Luxembourg courts.
4.16
Obligation to pay costs
A Luxembourg court may refuse to give effect to a purported contractual obligation to pay costs imposed upon another party in respect of the costs of any unsuccessful litigation brought against that party before a Luxembourg court. A Luxembourg court may not award by way of costs all of the expenditures incurred by a successful litigant in proceedings brought before a Luxembourg court.
4.17
Statute of limitations and set-off
Claims may become barred under statutory limitations period rules. Claims may be subject to the rules of set-off or counter-claims. No opinion is expressed, in general, as to whether rights of set-off are effective in a Luxembourg insolvency situation.
4.18
Service of process
Under Luxembourg law, a contractual provision allowing service of process against the Company to an agent for service of process could also, by virtue of Luxembourg domestic provisions allowing
the valid service of process against a company at its registered office, be validly made at the Company's registered office. If the designation of a process agent constituted (or were deemed to constitute) a power of attorney or mandate (
mandat
), whether or not irrevocable, it will terminate by force of law, and without notice, upon the occurrence of bankruptcy of the Company. We express no opinion as regards the effectiveness or ineffectiveness, or the consequences of such ineffectiveness, of a purported revocation by the Company of a power of attorney or mandate expressed to be irrevocable.
4.19
Severability
We express no opinion as to the validity or binding effect of any provision of the Opinion Documents which provides for the severance of illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.
4.20
Determination of notice date
A Luxembourg court might not give effect to a clause purporting to determine the date on which notice is deemed to have been made.
4.21
Discretion of certain parties
The discretion of any party under the Opinion Documents would have to be exercised in good faith.
4.22
Incorporation by Reference
We express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision incorporated into the Opinion Documents by reference to a law other than Luxembourg law, or as to the availability in Luxembourg of all remedies which are available in other jurisdictions.
4.23
Equitable Remedies
We express no opinion as to the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief, or, as to any matters which are within the discretion of the courts of Luxembourg in respect of any obligations of the Company as set out in the Opinion Documents.
4.24
Luxembourg legal concepts and language differences
Luxembourg legal concepts are expressed in English terms and not in their original French or German terms. The concepts concerned may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English terms as they exist under the laws of other jurisdictions. It should be noted that there are always irreconcilable differences between languages making it impossible to guarantee a totally accurate translation or interpretation. In particular, there are always some legal concepts which exist in one jurisdiction and not in another, and in those cases it is bound to be difficult to provide a completely satisfactory translation or interpretation because the vocabulary is missing from the language. We accept no responsibility for omissions or inaccuracies to the extent that any are attributable to such factors.
4.25
Meaning of "enforceable"
As used in this opinion, the term
enforceable
means that each obligation or document is of a type enforced by the Luxembourg courts. It is not certain, however, that each obligation or document will be enforced in accordance with its terms in every circumstance, enforcement being subject to,
inter alia
, the nature of the remedies available in the Luxembourg courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts (within the limits of Luxembourg law), the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of Luxembourg civil procedure rules regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under Luxembourg law. Enforcement may further be limited by general principles of equity and good faith.
4.26
Meaning of "public policy" or "public order"
Public policy
or
public order
means the fundamental concepts of Luxembourg law that the Luxembourg courts may deem, in a given case, to be of such significance so as to exclude the application of an (otherwise applicable) foreign law deemed to be contrary to such concepts.
This opinion is as of this date and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion or advise of changes hereafter occurring.
We express no opinion as to any matters other than those expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is, or may be, implied or inferred herefrom.
This opinion is given for your benefit as well as that of your assignees, successors and legal advisers. It may also be relied upon by Foley & Lardner LLP, special counsel to the Company, for the purposes of issuing the opinions required under the Credit Agreement. It may not be relied upon by any other person, except for Foley & Lardner LLP. It may not be disclosed to third parties, quoted, referred to or otherwise used (save as required by law) without our prior written consent.
Yours faithfully,
ALLEN & OVERY LUXEMBOURG

Opinion
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject to the reservations set out below and to any matters not disclosed to us, we are of the opinion that:
1.
The Company is an exempted company duly incorporated with limited liability and validly existing under the laws of Bermuda. The Company possesses the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name and is in good standing under the laws of Bermuda.
2.
The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and to take all action as may be necessary to complete the transactions contemplated thereby;
3.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
4.
The Credit Agreement has been duly executed by the Company and constitutes, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
5.
Subject as otherwise provided in this opinion, no consent, licence or authorisation of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any governmental authority or court of Bermuda is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the
Page 2
Credit Agreement or to ensure the legality, validity, admissibility into evidence or enforceability as to the Company, of the Credit Agreement.
6.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any requirement of any law or any regulation of Bermuda or (ii) the Constitutional Documents.
7.
The transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement are not subject to any currency deposit or reserve requirements in Bermuda. The Company has been designated as "non-resident" for the purposes of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and regulations made thereunder and there is no restriction or requirement of Bermuda binding on the Company which limits the availability or transfer of foreign exchange (i.e. monies denominated in currencies other than Bermuda dollars) for the purposes of the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Credit Agreement.
8.
The financial obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement rank at least
pari passu
in priority of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness (whether actual or contingent) issued, created or assumed by the Company other than indebtedness which is preferred by virtue of any provision of Bermuda law of general application.
9.
The choice of the laws of the State of New York as the proper law to govern the Credit Agreement is a valid choice of law under Bermuda law and such choice of law would be recognised, upheld and applied by the courts of Bermuda as the proper law of the Credit Agreement in proceedings brought before them in relation to the Credit Agreement, provided that (i) the point is specifically pleaded; (ii) such choice of law is valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York; and (iii) recognition would not be contrary to public policy as that term is understood under Bermuda law. We are not aware of any reason why the terms of the Credit Agreement would be deemed to be contrary to public policy.
10.
The submission by the Company to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York or of the United States for the Southern District of New York pursuant to the Credit Agreement is not contrary to Bermuda law and would be recognised by the courts of Bermuda as a legal, valid and binding submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York or of the United States for the Southern District of New York, if such submission is accepted by the courts of the State of New York or of the United States for the Southern District of New York and is legal, valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York.
11.
A final and conclusive judgment of a competent foreign court against the Company based upon the Credit Agreement (other than a court of jurisdiction to which The Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1958 applies, and it does not apply to the courts of the State of New York) under which a sum of money is payable (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature, in respect of a fine or other penalty, or in respect of multiple damages as defined in The Protection of Trading Interests Act 1981) may be the subject of enforcement proceedings in the Supreme Court of Bermuda under the common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the judgment of such competent foreign court. A final opinion as to the availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the foreign court's judgment are known, but, on general principles, we would expect such proceedings to be successful provided that:
(i)
the court which gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in accordance with private international law principles as applied in Bermuda; and
(ii)
the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Bermuda, has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice and is not based on an error in Bermuda law.
Enforcement of such a judgment against assets in Bermuda may involve the conversion of the judgment debt into Bermuda dollars, but the Bermuda Monetary Authority has indicated that its present policy is to give the consents necessary to enable recovery in the currency of the obligation.
No stamp duty or similar or other tax or duty is payable in Bermuda on the enforcement of a foreign judgment. Court fees will be payable in connection with proceedings for enforcement
12.
Neither the Company nor any of its assets or property enjoys, under Bermuda law, immunity on the grounds of sovereignty from any legal or other proceedings whatsoever or from enforcement, execution or attachment in respect of its obligations under the Credit Agreement.
Page 3
13.
Based solely upon the Company Search and the Litigation Search:
(i)
no litigation, arbitration or administrative or other proceeding of or before any arbitrator or governmental authority of Bermuda is pending against or affecting the Company or against or affecting any of its properties, rights, revenues or assets; and
(ii)
no notice to the Registrar of Companies of the passing of a resolution of members or creditors to wind up or the appointment of a liquidator or receiver has been given. No petition to wind up the Company or application to reorganise its affairs pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement or application for the appointment of a receiver has been filed with the Supreme Court.
14.
The Company has received an assurance from the Ministry of Finance granting an exemption, until 28 March 2016, from the imposition of tax under any applicable Bermuda law computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, provided that such exemption shall not prevent the application of any such tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda and shall not prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to land in Bermuda leased to the Company. There are, subject as otherwise provided in this opinion, no Bermuda taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, duties or similar charges now due, or which could in the future become due, in connection with the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, or in connection with the admissibility in evidence thereof and the Company is not required by any Bermuda law or regulation to make any deductions or withholdings in Bermuda from any payment it may make thereunder.
15.
Under Bermuda law, the Lenders and the Paying Agent will not be deemed to be resident, domiciled, carrying on any commercial activity in Bermuda or subject to any taxation in Bermuda by reason only of the entry into, performance or enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
16.
It is not necessary under Bermuda law that the Lenders or the Paying Agent be authorised, qualified or otherwise entitled to carry on business in Bermuda for their execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Credit Agreement.
17.
The appointment by the Company of CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10011 as agent for the receipt of any service of process in respect of any court in the State of New York in connection with any matter arising out of or in connection with the Credit Agreement is a valid and effective appointment, if such appointment is valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York and if no other procedural requirements are necessary in order to validate such appointment.
Reservations
        We have the following reservations;
Page 4
a)
The term "enforceable" as used in this opinion means that there is a way of ensuring that each party performs an agreement or that there are remedies available for breach.
b)
We express no opinion as to the availability of equitable remedies such as specific performance or injunctive relief, or as to any matters which are within the discretion of the courts of Bermuda in respect of any obligations of the Company as set out in the Credit Agreement. In particular, we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any present or future waiver of any provision of law (whether substantive or procedural) or of any right or remedy arising through circumstances not known at the time of entering into the Credit Agreement.
c)
Enforcement of the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement may be limited or affected by applicable laws from time to time in effect relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation or any other laws, or other legal procedures, affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights.
d)
Enforcement of the obligations of the Company may be the subject of a statutory limitation of the time within which such proceedings may be brought.
e)
We express no opinion as to any law other than Bermuda law and none of the opinions expressed herein relates to compliance with or matters governed by the laws of any jurisdiction except Bermuda. This opinion is limited to Bermuda law as applied by the Courts of Bermuda at the date hereof.
f)
Where an obligation is to be performed in a jurisdiction other than Bermuda, the courts of Bermuda may refuse to enforce it to the extent that such performance would be illegal under the laws of, or contrary to public policy of, such other jurisdiction.
g)
We express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision incorporated into the Credit Agreement by reference to a law other than that of Bermuda, or as to the availability in Bermuda of all remedies which are available in other jurisdictions.
h)
Where a person is vested with a discretion or may determine a matter in his or its opinion, such discretion may have to be exercised reasonably or such an opinion may have to be based on reasonable grounds.
i)
Any provision in the Credit Agreement that certain calculations or certificates will be conclusive and binding will not be effective if such calculations or certificates are fraudulent or erroneous on their face and will not necessarily prevent juridical enquiries into the merits of any claim by an aggrieved party.
j)
We express no opinion as to the validity or binding effect of any provision in the Credit Agreement for the payment of interest at a higher rate on overdue amounts than on amounts which are current. Such a provision may not be enforceable if it could be established that the amount expressed as being payable was in the nature of a penalty; that is to say a requirement for a stipulated sum to be paid irrespective of, or necessarily greater than, the loss likely to be sustained. If it cannot be demonstrated to the Bermuda court that the higher payment was a reasonable pre-estimate of the loss suffered, the court will determine and award what it considers to be reasonable damages. Section 9 of The Interest and Credit Charges (Regulations) Act 1975 provides that the Bermuda courts have discretion as to the amount of interest, if any, payable on the amount of a judgment after date of judgment. If the Court does not exercise that discretion, then interest will accrue at the statutory rate which is currently 7% per annum.
k)
We express no opinion as to the validity or binding effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement which provides for the severance of illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.
Page 5
l)
A Bermuda court may refuse to give effect to any provisions of the Credit Agreement in respect of costs of unsuccessful litigation brought before the Bermuda court or where that court has itself made an order for costs.
m)
Searches of the Register of Companies at the office of the Registrar of Companies and of the Supreme Court Causes Book at the Registry of the Supreme Court are not conclusive and it should be noted that the Register of Companies and the Supreme Court Causes Book do not reveal:
(i)
details of matters which have been lodged for filing or registration which as a matter of best practice of the Registrar of Companies or the Registry of the Supreme Court would have or should have been disclosed on the public file, the Causes Book or the Judgment Book, as the case may be, but for whatever reason have not actually been filed or registered or are not disclosed or which, notwithstanding filing or registration, at the date and time the search is concluded are for whatever reason not disclosed or do not appear on the public file, the Causes Book or Judgment Book;
(ii)
details of matters which should have been lodged for filing or registration at the Registrar of Companies or the Registry of the Supreme Court but have not been lodged for filing or registration at the date the search is concluded;
(iii)
whether an application to the Supreme Court for a winding-up petition or for the appointment of a receiver or manager has been prepared but not yet been presented or has been presented but does not appear in the Causes Book at the date and time the search is concluded;
(iv)
whether any arbitration or administrative proceedings are pending or whether any proceedings are threatened, or whether any arbitrator has been appointed; or
(v)
whether a receiver or manager has been appointed privately pursuant to the provisions of a debenture or other security, unless notice of the fact has been entered in the Register of Charges in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
Furthermore, in the absence of a statutorily defined system for the registration of charges created by companies incorporated outside Bermuda ("overseas companies") over their assets located in Bermuda, it is not possible to determine definitively from searches of the Register of Charges maintained by the Registrar of Companies in respect of such overseas companies what charges have been registered over any of their assets located in Bermuda or whether any one charge has priority over any other charge over such assets.
n)
In order to issue this opinion we have carried out the Company Search as referred to in the Schedule to this opinion and have not enquired as to whether there has been any change since the date of such search.
o)
In order to issue this opinion we have carried out the Litigation Search as referred to in the Schedule to this opinion and have not enquired as to whether there has been any change since the date of such search.
p)
In paragraph (1) above, the term "good standing" means that the Company has received a Certificate of Compliance from the Registrar of Companies.
Disclosure
This opinion is addressed to you solely for your benefit and is neither to be transmitted to any other person (other than permitted assigns and transferees under the Credit Agreement), nor relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose nor quoted or referred to in any public document nor filed
Page 6
with any governmental agency or person, without our prior written consent, except as may be required by law or regulatory authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, we expressly agree that Mr William Lytton, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company and the Company's U.S. counsel Foley & Lardner, may rely on this opinion as to matters of Bermuda law for the purpose of issuing his or their opinion in connection with the transactions aforesaid.
Further, this opinion speaks as of its date and is strictly limited to the matters stated herein and we assume no obligation to review or update this opinion if applicable law or the existing facts or circumstances should change.
This opinion is governed by and is to be construed in accordance with Bermuda law.
Yours faithfully
Appleby Spurling Hunter

Lenders
") and to Bank of America, N.A., as Paying Agent for the Lenders
Re:
Tyco International Group S.A.Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as special counsel to Tyco International Group S.A., a Luxembourg socit anonyme (the "
Company
"), and Tyco International Ltd., a Bermuda company (the "Parent"), in connection with the preparation of:
        (i)    The Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (the "
Credit Agreement
") by and among the Company, the Parent, the Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as Paying Agent (together with the Lenders, the "
Lender Parties
"); and
        (ii)   the Notes dated as of December 16, 2004 (the "
Notes
") made by the Company payable to the order of certain of the Lenders.
        Each capitalized term used and not defined herein has the meaning assigned to that term in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement and the Notes are collectively referred to herein as the "
Financing Documents
." The Company and the Parent are collectively referred to herein as the "
Obligors
." We have assumed without independent investigation that:
a)
The signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all individuals executing such documents had all requisite legal capacity and competency and were duly authorized, the documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and the documents submitted to us as certified or reproduction copies conform to the originals.
b)
Each party to the Financing Document has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Financing Documents to which it is a party, the execution and delivery of such Financing Documents by such party and performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and do not violate any law, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to such party, such Financing Documents have been duly executed and delivered by each such party and the Credit Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Lender Party, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.
c)
The execution, delivery and performance of the Financing Documents by each Obligor do not and will not violate any law, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to such Obligor, except as expressly covered by our opinion in paragraph 3 below.
d)
Except as provided in the Credit Agreement, there are no agreements or understandings between or among the Lender Parties, or any of them, and the Obligors that would expand, modify or otherwise affect the terms of the Financing Documents or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder.
        In rendering this opinion, we have made such inquiries and examined, among other things, originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records, agreements, certificates, instruments and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. As to certain factual matters, we have relied to the extent we deemed appropriate and without independent investigation upon the representation and warranties of the
Obligors in the Financing Documents, certificates of officers of the Obligors or certificates obtained from public officials and others.
        Based on the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
        1.     Each Financing Document constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor party thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.
        2.     The execution, delivery and performance by any Obligor of the Financing Documents to which it is a party, do not,
a)
based solely upon review of the governmental orders, judgments or decrees identified to us in the Officer's Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "
Officer's Certificate
") and the 10-K filed by TIL on December 14, 2004, as constituting all orders, judgments or decrees binding on such Obligor (each a "
Governmental Order
"), violate any Governmental Order, or
b)
based solely upon review of the documents identified to us in the Officer's Certificate, as constituting all material contracts of the Obligors, taken as a whole, (each a "
Material Contract
"), (A) result in a material breach of or default under any Material Contract or (B) result in or require the creation or imposition of any lien or encumbrance upon any assets of such Obligor under any Material Contract.
        3.     The execution, delivery and performance by any Obligor of the Financing Documents to which it is a party, do not violate, or require any Obligor to make any filing with or obtain any approval of any governmental authority or regulatory body of the State of New York or the United States of America under, any law or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America applicable to such Obligor that, in our experience, is generally applicable to transactions in the nature of those contemplated by the Financing Documents, such filings or approvals that, if not made or obtained, would not have a material adverse effect on the Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or on their ability to perform their obligations under the Financing Documents and would not expose any Lender Party to liability.
        4.     No Obligor is required to register as an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
        The foregoing opinions are subject to the following exceptions, qualifications and limitations:
        A.    We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion is limited to the effect of the present state of the laws of the State of New York, the United States of America and the facts as they presently exist. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion in the event of future changes in such laws or the interpretations thereof or such facts.
        B.    Our opinion set forth in paragraph 1 is subject to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent transfers or preferential transfers and other laws and judicially developed doctrines relating to or affecting creditors' or secured creditors' rights and remedies generally) and (ii) general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
        C.    Our opinion is limited by the possibility that certain rights, remedies, waivers and other provisions of the Financing Documents may not be enforceable; nevertheless, such unenforceability
will not render any of the Financing Documents invalid as a whole or preclude the realization of the principal legal rights and benefits afforded by such documents including (a) judicial enforcement of the obligation of the Company to repay the principal, together with interest thereon, as provided in the Credit Agreement and (b) acceleration of the obligation of the Company to repay such principal, together with such interest, upon a material default in a material provision of the Financing Documents.
        D.    In rendering our opinions expressed in paragraph 2 insofar as they require interpretation of Material Contracts, we have relied on certificates of the Obligors with respect to the compliance by any Obligor with, or any financial calculations or data in respect of, financial covenants or any limitations expressed as a dollar amount or percentage amount or restricted payments test included in any Material Contract.
        E.    We express no opinion as to the applicability to, or the effect of noncompliance by, any Lender Party with any state or federal laws, applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents because of the nature of the business of such Lender Party.
        This opinion is rendered to the Lender Parties in connection with the Financing Documents and may not be relied upon by any person other than the Lender Parties or by the Lender Parties in any other context, provided that the Lender Parties may provide this opinion (i) to bank examiners and other regulatory authorities should they so request in connection with their normal examinations, (ii) to the independent auditors and attorneys of the Lender Parties, (iii) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency, (iv) in connection with any legal action to which any Lender Party is a party arising out of the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents, or (v) the proposed assignee of or participant in the interest of any Lender Party under the Financing Documents. Except as set forth in the prior sentence, this opinion may not be quoted without the prior written consent of this Firm.

To the Lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement referred to below and Bank of America, N.A., as Paying Agent for such Lenders
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as special New York counsel to Bank of America, N.A., as Paying Agent (the "
Paying Agent
") in connection with the Five Year Credit Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (the "
Credit Agreement
") among Tyco International Group S.A., a Luxembourg company (the "
Borrower
"), Tyco International Ltd., a Bermuda company (the "
Parent
"), the financial institutions referred to as "Lenders" in the Credit Agreement (the "
Lenders
") and the Paying Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement have the same respective defined meanings when used herein.
        In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined an executed counterpart of the Credit Agreement. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement or in certificates delivered by or on behalf of the Principal Obligors pursuant thereto. We have also assumed that the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and (except, to the extent set forth below, as to the Borrower) constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of, all of the parties thereto, that all signatories thereto have been duly authorized and that all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform the same, and that all authorizations, approvals or consents of (including without limitation all foreign exchange control approvals), and all filings or registrations with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency (including without limitation Luxembourg and Bermuda) required for the making and performance by the Principal Obligors of the Credit Agreement have been obtained or made and are in effect.
        Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and to the possible judicial application of foreign laws or governmental action affecting the rights of creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of the Credit Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
        The foregoing opinions are also subject to the following comments and qualifications:
        (A)  The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
        (B)  The enforceability of Section 10.05 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
        (C)  We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than New York) that limits the interest, fees or other charges it may
impose for the loan or use of money or other credit, (ii) the last sentence of Section 2.11 of the Credit Agreement, (iii) the penultimate sentence of Section 10.07(d) of the Credit Agreement, (iv) Section 10.09 of the Credit Agreement, (v) the first sentence of Section 10.15(b) of the Credit Agreement insofar as such sentence relates to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (vi) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 10.15(b) of the Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or (vii) Section 10.16 of the Credit Agreement.
        (D)  We express no opinion as to Section 10.18 of the Credit Agreement to the extent it relates to immunity acquired after the date of execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
        (E)  We wish to point out with reference to obligations stated to be payable in a currency other than Dollars that (i) a New York statute provides that a judgment rendered by a court of the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in such other currency would be rendered in such other currency and would be converted into Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment and (ii) a judgment rendered by a Federal court sitting in the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in such other currency may be expressed in Dollars, but we express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such Federal court would apply.
        The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not hold ourselves out as experts on, or purport to advise on, the laws of Luxembourg or Bermuda.
        This opinion letter is provided to you by us as special New York counsel to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(iv) of the Credit Agreement and may not be relied upon by any other person (other than your permitted assignees and participants, each of whom may rely upon it as though addressed to such persons) or for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without our prior written consent in each instance.

EXHIBIT E
        WHEREAS, Tyco International Group S.A., a Luxembourg company (the "
Borrower
"), has entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of December 16, 2004 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") among the Borrower, Tyco International Ltd., the lenders listed on the signature pages thereof, and Bank of America, N.A., as Paying Agent, pursuant to which the Borrower is or may be entitled, subject to certain conditions, to borrow loans and request the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate principal or face amount of up to $1,000,000,000;
        WHEREAS, in conjunction with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement and in consideration of the financial and other support that the Borrower has provided, and such financial and other support as the Borrower may in the future provide, to the undersigned (together with its successors, the "
Guarantor
") and in order to induce the Lenders and the Paying Agent to enter into the Credit Agreement and to make extensions of credit thereunder, the Guarantor is willing to guarantee the obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the Notes issued thereunder;
        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
        SECTION 1.01.
    Definitions.
    Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are used herein as therein defined. In addition the following terms, as used herein, have the following meanings:
        "Guaranteed Obligations" means (i) all obligations of the Borrower in respect of principal of and interest on the Loans and the Notes, (ii) all other amounts payable by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement or any Note and (iii) all renewals or extensions of the foregoing, in each case whether now outstanding or hereafter arising.

unconditionally agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity or by declaration or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Borrower.
        SECTION 2.02.
    Guarantee Unconditional.

        (e)   the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against any other Obligor, the Paying Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection with the Financing Documents;
provided
that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
        (f)    any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any other Obligor for any reason of any Financing Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any other Obligor of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable by any other Obligor under any Financing Document; or
        (g)   any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any other Obligor, the Paying Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of the Guarantor under this Article 2.

    Limit of Liability.

If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable by the Borrower under any Financing Document is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any other Obligor or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations under this Article 2 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had become due but had not been made at such time.
        SECTION 2.05.
    Waiver.
    The Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any other Obligor or any other Person.

") which is one year and five days after the Termination Date if, but only if, (x) no Default or Event of Default of the type described in Section 7.01 of the Credit Agreement with respect to the relevant Other Party has existed at any time on and after the Subrogation Trigger Date and (y) the existence of such Guarantor's rights under this clause (b) would not make such Guarantor a creditor (as defined in the Bankruptcy Code) of such Other Party in any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding commenced on or prior to the Subrogation Trigger Date.
        SECTION 2.07.
    Stay of Acceleration.
    If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under the Financing Documents is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Financing Documents shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Paying Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders.

The Guarantor irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claim of error by reason of any such service and agrees that such service shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Guarantor in any such suit, action or proceeding and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid and personal service upon and personal delivery to the Guarantor.
        (iii)  
No Limitation on Service or Suit
.    Nothing in this Section 4.07 shall affect the right of the Paying Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or limit the right of the Paying Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against the Guarantor in the courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions.

Other Currency
") other than that in which the relevant payment is due (the "
Required Currency
") then, to the extent that the payment (when converted into the Required Currency at the rate of exchange on the date of payment or, if it is not practicable for the party entitled thereto (the "
Payee
") to purchase the Required Currency with the other Currency on the date of payment, at the rate of exchange as soon thereafter as it is practicable for it to do so) actually received by the Payee falls short of the amount due under the terms of this Subsidiary Guarantee, the Guarantor shall, to the extent permitted by law, as a separate and independent obligation, indemnify and hold harmless the Payee against the amount of such shortfall.
