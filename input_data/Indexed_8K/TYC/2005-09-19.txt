Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
 
As Tyco previously disclosed in its Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2005, Tyco has been engaged in discussions with the SEC's Division of Enforcement to resolve the matters raised in the SEC's investigation that began in 2002.  At that time, Tyco recorded a charge of $50 million, which represents the Company's best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties management believes the Company will likely pay to resolve the matters raised in that investigation.  In connection with these settlement discussions:
 
      Tyco's current financial statements are not at issue and Tyco stands behind its current financial statements.
 - 
      The SEC Staff's proposed allegations relate to Tyco's historical accounting for the periods 1996 to 2002.
 - 
      The settlement under discussion with the SEC Staff would not require Tyco to restate any of its financial statements.
 - 
 
Final resolution with the SEC is subject to a number of uncertainties, including finalizing the terms of a settlement that the Enforcement Staff will agree to recommend to the Commission, the Company's submission of an offer of settlement approved by the Tyco Board of Directors, and the Commission's approval of a settlement offer.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
