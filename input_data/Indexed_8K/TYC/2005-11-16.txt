Company Used Approximately $1 Billion of Cash to Retire 34 Million Fully Diluted Shares Through October 17th
 
PEMBROKE, Bermuda  Nov. 16, 2005  Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC; BSX: TYC) today reported diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations (EPS) of $0.42 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005, compared with $0.27 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004.  Last year's results included net charges of $0.18 per share related to the early retirement of debt, as well as restructuring and divestiture charges.  Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $10.0 billion, with organic revenue growth of 2 percent.  Cash flow from operating activities was $2.1 billion, and the company generated free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter.  Beginning in the fourth quarter, the Plastics & Adhesives segment is classified as a discontinued operation and results of this segment are reported accordingly.  Plastics & Adhesives revenue was $465 million, and operating income was $32 million.
 
In the current quarter, EPS from continuing operations included net charges of $0.06 per share for special items as follows:
 
The company's fourth quarter GAAP tax rate was approximately 1 percent, and the fourth quarter tax rate adjusted for special items was 21 percent.  The company's full-year GAAP tax rate was 23.5 percent, and the full-year tax rate adjusted for special items was 24.8 percent.
 
During the quarter, the company resolved certain legacy matters which resulted in $0.10 per share of income.  Included in these legacy matters were $0.07 of income related to the resolution of certain tax matters, $0.05 of income related to a restitution award by the court for losses suffered as a result of misconduct by certain former executives of the company, and a $0.02 charge for certain potential liabilities relating to other former executives' employment.
 
For the full year, Tyco had revenue of $39.7 billion, with net income of $3.0 billion and organic revenue growth of 3 percent.  Cash flow from operating activities totaled $6.1 billion and the company generated free cash flow including Plastics & Adhesives of $4.7 billion.
 
"During 2005, Tyco made important progress in investing for growth, building balance sheet strength and returning capital to our shareholders," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen.  "Tyco is well-positioned for further progress in 2006."
 
Organic revenue growth, free cash flow, net debt and tax rate adjusted for special items are non-GAAP financial measures and are described below.  For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, see the attached tables.  To further assist in understanding the special items included in Tyco's GAAP results for fiscal 2005, the company has provided summary schedules attached to this document.  A set of detailed schedules can be found at on the Investor Relations portion of Tyco's website.

HIGHLIGHTS
 
Equity Retirement Activities  In the fourth quarter, the company used approximately $450 million of cash to repurchase convertible debt securities and $300 million to repurchase shares in the open market.  In the two weeks following the quarter, the company used approximately $200 million of cash to repurchase additional shares.  In total, these actions reduced Tyco's diluted shares outstanding by approximately 34 million shares.  Since the convertible debt and share repurchases began in the fourth quarter of 2004, the company has used $4.2 billion of cash and reduced diluted shares outstanding by 130 million  representing 6 percent of diluted shares outstanding.
 - 
                 
 
Strengthening the Balance Sheet  For the full year, total debt declined $4.0 billion to $12.6 billion.  The company's total debt-to-capital ratio improved to 28 percent, from 35 percent at the close of 2004.
 - 
                 
 
Investing for Growth  Healthcare acquired Vivant Medical Inc., a leading developer of microwave ablation technology, and also acquired a controlling interest in Floreane
 - 
                 
Medical Implants, a manufacturer of surgical mesh products.  Both of these transactions strengthen Healthcare's surgical product portfolio.
 
Contract Win  Tyco Electronics' M/A-COM business signed a contract to design, deploy, operate and maintain New York's Statewide Wireless Network, one of the largest statewide public safety communications projects to be awarded in the United States.

SEGMENT RESULTS
 
The financial results presented in the tables below are in accordance with GAAP.  All dollar amounts are pretax and stated in millions.  All comparisons are to the quarter ended September 30, 2004, unless otherwise indicated.
 
Fire & Security
 
 
Organic revenue growth was 1.4 percent.  The Worldwide Fire business had 5 percent organic revenue growth, while Worldwide Security excluding Continental Europe was essentially flat.
 
Operating income increased by $162 million, due to lower restructuring and divestiture charges.  While operating expenses were essentially flat, significant investments in sales and marketing were offset by further reductions in general and administrative costs.  Operating income in the quarter included a $6 million charge related to divestitures, compared to $170 million of restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Electronics
 
 
Organic revenue growth was 3 percent.  Organic revenue growth of 5 percent in connector and cable assemblies was driven by aerospace, communication service providers,
, and energy markets.  This growth was partially offset by a significant revenue decline in the Printed Circuit Board business.
communications equipment, automotive, computer, consumer electronics
 
Operating income decreased $51 million and the operating margin was 14 percent.  The operating margin was adversely impacted by 90 basis points due to continued cost escalation in metals and other commodities, 30 basis points due to a customer bankruptcy filing, and the remainder primarily due to North American and European fixed cost under-absorption.
 
Healthcare
 
 
Organic revenue growth was 1 percent, driven by strong growth in the International, Surgical and Pharmaceutical businesses, primarily offset by a significant revenue decline in the Retail business.
 
Operating income decreased $293 million primarily due to a $277 million charge for a previously disclosed legal matter.  Profit improvement in the International, Surgical and Pharmaceutical businesses was offset by a $43 million profit decline in the Retail business.
 
Engineered Products & Services
 
 
Revenue increased $36 million, or 2 percent, while organic revenue growth was 1 percent.  Three of the four business units posted combined 7 percent organic revenue growth, which was offset by an approximate $80 million revenue decline at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects.  In Electrical &
Metal Products, steel price declines were offset by volume growth  resulting in modest organic revenue growth.
 
Operating income decreased $1 million, with profit improvement at Flow Control and Fire & Building products offset by a $58 million decline at Electrical & Metal Products due to higher steel raw material costs and reduced steel selling prices.  Prior-year fourth quarter operating income included $45 million in restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges.
 
OUTLOOK
 
In fiscal 2006, the company expects EPS from continuing operations excluding special items to increase by approximately 10 percent over full-year 2005 results.  The company further expects that 2006 free cash flow, excluding the cash impact of previously disclosed legal items, will exceed net income excluding special items.
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Tyco will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, which requires compensation costs related to share-based payments to be recognized in the financial statements.  This is expected to negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share for the full year.  The Plastics & Adhesives segment is reported as a discontinued operation and is excluded from 2006 guidance.
 
For the first quarter, the company expects to achieve EPS from continuing operations excluding special items of $0.40 to $0.42.  This guidance includes restructuring charges of approximately $0.01 per share to close several high-cost Electronics manufacturing plants as well as approximately $0.02 per share charge from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R discussed above.
 
EPS from continuing operations excluding special items is a non-GAAP financial measure and is described below.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
 
"EPS from continuing operations excluding special items," "free cash flow" (FCF), "organic revenue growth" and "tax rate adjusted for special items" are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.
 
The company has forecast its EPS from continuing operations results excluding special items related to divestitures, early retirement of debt, and other income or charges that may mask the underlying results and trends and make it difficult to give investors perspective on underlying business results.  Because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items and the associated charges or gains that will be taken, it is difficult to include the impact of those items in the forecast.
 
The company has forecast its cash flow results excluding any voluntary pension contributions because it has not yet made a determination about the amount and timing of any future such contributions.  In addition, the company's forecast excludes the impact of special items because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items.
 
The difference between cash flows from operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows that the company believes are useful to identify.  FCF permits management and investors to gain insight into the number that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. It is also a significant component in the company's incentive compensation plans.  The difference reflects the impact from:
 
 - 
                 
the sale of accounts receivable programs,
 - 
                 
net capital expenditures,
 - 
                 
acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program),
 - 
                 
cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn-out liabilities and,
 - 
                 
voluntary pension contributions.
See the accompanying tables to this press release for a cash flow statement presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation presenting the components of FCF.
 
The impact from the sale of accounts receivable programs and voluntary pension contributions is added or subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity.  Capital expenditures and the ADT dealer program are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn-out liabilities is subtracted from Cash Flow from Operating Activities because these cash outflows are not available for general corporate uses.
 
The limitation associated with using FCF is that it subtracts cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and that therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure.  This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.
 
FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  The measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures.  Investors are urged to read the company's financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the accompanying tables to this press release that show all the elements of the GAAP measures of Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Cash Flows from Investing Activities, Cash Flows from Financing Activities and a reconciliation of the company's total cash and cash equivalents for the period.
 
"Organic revenue growth" is a useful measure used by the company to measure the underlying results and trends in the business.  The difference between reported net revenue growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic revenue growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and other changes that do not reflect the underlying results and trends (for example, revenue reclassifications and changes to the fiscal year).
 
Organic revenue growth is a useful measure of the company's performance because it excludes items that:  i) are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of foreign currency exchange; or ii) do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity, or revenue reclassification.  It is also a component of the company's compensation programs. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company's revenue.  This limitation is best addressed by using organic revenue growth in combination with the GAAP numbers. See the accompanying tables to this press release for the reconciliation presenting the components of organic revenue growth.
 
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results. Net debt is total debt (the most comparable GAAP measure) minus cash and cash equivalents. Management believes net debt is an important measure of liquidity, which it uses as a tool to measure the company's ability to meet its future debt obligations. Cash and cash equivalents are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce our debt obligations
. See the accompanying table to this press release for the reconciliation of net debt.
 
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash items and therefore may imply that there is less company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates and may include certain cash items that are not readily available for repaying debt. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with total debt because
net debt may be significantly lower than the GAAP measure. Net debt should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures.
 
"Tax rate adjusted for special items" is a measure used by the company to determine and analyze the underlying results and trends in the business.  The difference between the reported tax rate (the most comparable GAAP measure) and the tax rate adjusted for special items (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the tax impact of special items related to divestitures, early retirement of debt, and
other pretax income or charges that may mask the underlying results and trends and make it difficult to give management and investors perspective on underlying business results.  The tax rate adjusted for special items may also exclude large legacy tax settlements with U.S. and non-U.S. taxing authorities that, if included in the rate, would mask the after-tax result of the current-period operations.
 
"Tax rate adjusted for special items" is a useful measure in evaluating the company's performance because it excludes items that do not reflect the underlying operations of the company, such as settlements of legacy tax matters with taxing authorities and the attendant tax impacts of special items for which management has adjusted in "EPS from continuing operations excluding special items" as noted above.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company's GAAP tax rate.  This limitation is best addressed by using the tax rate adjusted for special items in combination with the GAAP numbers.  See the accompanying tables to this press release for the reconciliation presenting the components of the tax rate adjusted for special items.
