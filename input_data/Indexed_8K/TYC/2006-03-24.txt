As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, including in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, is a lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  In this lawsuit, Masimo alleged violations of antitrust laws against Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximetry products.  Masimo alleged that Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt used their market position to prevent hospitals from purchasing Masimo's pulse oximetry products.  Masimo sought injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages.  Trial in this case began on February 22, 2005 and the jury awarded Masimo $140 million in damages on March 21, 2005.  The damages were automatically trebled under the antitrust statute to an award of $420 million.  If ultimately successful, Masimo's attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees and costs in addition to the verdict amount.
Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP ("Tyco Healthcare") and Mallinckrodt, Inc.
 
On March 22, 2006, the district court issued its Memorandum of Decision Re: Post-Trial Motions.  In that Memorandum, the district court:  (i) vacated the jury's liability findings on two business practices; (ii) affirmed the jury's liability finding on two other business practices; (iii) vacated the jury's damages award in its entirety; and (iv) ordered a new trial on damages.  The district court has not scheduled the new trial on the damages.  As previously reported by the Company, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to this damage award.
