Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
The Company disclosed previously in its annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") had filed a patent infringement suit against the Company's subsidiary, U.S. Surgical, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  The complaint alleges that U. S. Surgical's VERSASEAL Plus trocar product infringes on Applied Medical's U.S. Patent No. 5,385,533.  On February 7, 2005, the district court granted U.S. Surgical's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and Applied Medical appealed the summary judgment.  On May 15, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment on the grounds that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding U.S. Surgical's infringement of Applied Medical's patent and remanded the case back to the district court.   The Company is exploring its options with respect to this case including filing a motion for rehearing or for en banc review.
