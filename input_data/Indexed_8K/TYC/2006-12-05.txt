Item 4.01  Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
1.             Effective November 30, 2006, Mitchell & Titus, LLP ("Mitchell & Titus") resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm of Tyco International (US) Inc., Retirement Savings and Investment Plan VI (Puerto Rico)  (the "Plan").  Mitchell & Titus has announced that the firm is exptected to join Ernst & Young Global Limited as a member firm later this year.  While there have been no auditor independence issues with Mitchell & Titus to date, they have resigned to avoid any potential future conflict of interest.  The resignation of Mitchell & Titus was accepted by the Administrative Committee of the Plan on November 30, 2006.
2.             Mitchell & Titus was engaged as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Plan and, except for services rendered in connection with its audit of the financial statements of the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2005, has not rendered any services to the Plan.
The Plan has not yet engaged a new independent registered public accounting firm.

4.             The report of Mitchell & Titus on the Plan's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and through November 30, 2006, there have been (1) no disagreements with Mitchell & Titus on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of Mitchell & Titus would have caused them to make reference thereto in their report on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, and (2) no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)).
