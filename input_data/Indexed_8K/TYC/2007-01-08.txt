Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Settlement Agreement and Executive Employment Agreement
Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco") and Richard J. Meelia, the Chief Executive Officer of Tyco's  Healthcare segment, entered into an agreement dated February 14, 2002, which was subsequently amended and extended on December 9, 2004 and December 9, 2005, (the "Retention Agreement") under which Mr. Meelia was entitled to receive certain termination payments and benefits in the event of his termination of employment for any reason, other than by the Company for Cause, prior to June 30, 2007.    On December 29, 2006, Mr. Meelia and Tyco executed an agreement to terminate the Retention Agreement in exchange for a payment to Mr. Meelia of Five Million Dollars to be made in January 2007.
On December 29, 2006, Mr. Meelia and Tyco Healthcare Ltd. (the "Company") entered into an executive employment agreement, that provides that Mr. Meelia will continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Tyco's Healthcare segment until the spin-off of the Healthcare segment from Tyco (the "Spin-off"), and as the Chief Executive Officer of Tyco Healthcare Ltd. after the Spin-off.  The agreement provides that Mr. Meelia will receive a base salary, a bonus and a long-term incentive opportunity as determined by the board of directors of Tyco (pre Spin-off) or Tyco Healthcare Ltd., (post Spin-off) as well as be eligible to participate in all employee benefit plans and programs applicable to executives generally.
The general terms of the employment agreement provide that, if Mr. Meelia's employment is terminated for any reason other than by the Company for cause (as defined in the agreement) and subject to the execution of a general release in favor of the Company in the form provided in the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay him a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to two times the sum of  (1) his base salary and (2) his target annual bonus.  This payment may be delayed until six months after termination of employment if necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Mr. Meelia and his eligible dependents also will receive continued coverage for two years in all health and welfare plans in which he participated on his date of termination, and, upon the same terms and conditions as in effect on the date of termination (or as amended from time to time), subject to Mr. Meelia's continued payment of applicable premiums.  In the event of a change in control of the Company on or prior to June 30, 2007, Mr. Meelia's unvested options and restricted shares vest immediately.  Finally, Mr. Meelia is required under the agreement not to compete with the Company nor solicit managerial level employees or customers of the Company for a period of one year following termination of employment, nor to disparage the Company after his termination.

Exhibit 10.1
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated as of December 29, 2006 (the "Effective Date") between Tyco Healthcare Ltd., a Bermuda corporation ("Company") and Richard S. Meelia ("Executive").
WHEREAS, Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd., a Bermuda corporation ("Parent") and, along with its subsidiaries, currently does business as Parent's "Healthcare" business segment; and
WHEREAS, Executive is currently employed by Tyco Healthcare Group LP and serves as Chief Executive Office of Parent's "Healthcare" business segment;
WHEREAS, it is anticipated that Company will be spun off by Parent in 2007 as a separate publicly-traded corporation through issuance of a stock dividend to Parent's shareholders (the "Separation"), as described in a Form 8-K filed by Parent on January 19, 2006;
WHEREAS, Company and Executive desire to enter into this Employment Agreement to set forth certain material terms of Executive's employment;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, of the mutual promises contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1.             POSITION/DUTIES.
(a)           Prior to the Separation, Executive shall continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Parent's "Healthcare" business segment.  In this capacity, Executive shall have such duties, authorities and responsibilities as the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Parent (the "CEO") shall designate that are consistent with Executive's position.  Executive shall report to the CEO.
(b)           Upon and following the Separation, Executive shall serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  In this capacity, Executive shall have such duties, authorities and responsibilities as the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board") shall designate that are consistent with Executive's position.  Upon and following the Separation, Executive shall report to the Board.
 
1
 
Hereinafter, for ease of reference, the term "Employing Company" shall refer to "Parent" prior to the Separation and "Company" thereafter.
(c)           Executive's employment shall be at will, meaning that such employment may be terminated by Executive or by the Employing Company at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, subject to the provisions of Section 3 hereof.
(d)           Executive shall devote substantially all of his business time (excluding periods of vacation and other approved leaves of absence) to the performance of his duties with the Employing Company, provided the foregoing shall not prevent Executive from (i) participating in charitable, civic, educational, professional, community or industry affairs or, with prior written approval of the CEO or the Board (as applicable), serving on the board of directors or advisory boards of other companies; and (ii) managing his and his family's personal investments so long as such activities do not materially interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder or create a potential business conflict or the appearance thereof. If at any time service on any board of directors or advisory board would, in the good faith judgment of the CEO or the Board (as applicable), conflict with Executive's fiduciary duty to the Employing Company or create any appearance thereof, Executive shall promptly resign from such other board of directors or advisory board after written notice of the conflict is received from the CEO or the Board (as applicable). Service on the boards of directors or advisory boards disclosed by Executive to Parent on which he is serving as of the Effective Date is hereby approved by Parent and Company.
(e)           Executive further agrees to serve without additional compensation as an officer and/or director of any of the Employing Company's subsidiaries and agrees that any amounts received from such corporation may be offset against the amounts due hereunder.  In addition, it is agreed that the Company may assign the Executive to one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for payroll purposes.
2.             COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.  Executive shall receive compensation for his services hereunder as determined by the Employing Company's Board of Directors from time to time, including base salary, bonus and long-term incentive opportunity.  Any base salary shall be payable periodically in accordance with the Employing Company's regular payroll practices.  In addition, Executive shall be entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans and programs of the Employing Company applicable to senior executives generally, as may be determined or modified from time to time.  Travel, business and entertainment expenses shall be reimbursed by the Employing Company in accordance with its then-applicable corporate policies.
 
2
 
Upon the occurrence of a "change in control" or a sale of the Employing Company on or prior to June 30, 2007, all shares of restricted stock previously granted to Executive that are still subject to risk of forfeiture shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable and all options to purchase common shares of the Employing Company (or any converted shares received in the separation) that remain unxercisable shall become fully exercisable and vested.  For purposes of this Section 2, "change in control" shall mean the first to occur of the following:
(a) Any "person" (as that term is used in Sections 13 and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) becomes the beneficial owner (as that term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of 30% or more of Employing Company's capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors:
(b) Persons who, as of the Effective Date (or with respect to the Company, as of the effective date of the Separation), constitute the board of Employing Company (the "Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason, including, without limitation, as a result of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or similar transaction, to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a director of Employing Company subsequent to the Effective Date (or with respect to the Company, subsequent to the effective date of the Separation) shall be considered an Incumbent Director if such person's election or nomination for election was approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the Incumbent Directors; but provided further, that any such person whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of members of the board of Employing Company or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a "person" (as that term is used in Sections 13 and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) other than the board of Employing Company, including by reason of agreement intended to avoid or settle any such actual or threatened contest or solicitation, shall not be considered an Incumbent Director;
(c) The shareholders of Employing Company approve any consolidation or merger of Employing Company, other than a merger of Employing Company in which the holders of the common stock of Employing Company immediately prior to the merger hold more than 50% of the common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger;
(d) The shareholders of Employing Company approve any plan or proposal for the sale or dissolution of Employing Company;
(e) Substantially all of the assets of Employing Company are sold or otherwise transferred to parties that are not within a "controlled group of
 
3
 
corporations" (as defined in Section 1563 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) in which the Employing Company is a member.
For avoidance of any doubt, the Separation does not constitute a "Change in Control" hereunder.
3.             SEPARATION BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE.  If Executive's employment terminates for any reason other than termination by the Employing Company for Cause (as hereinafter defined), then the Employing Company shall pay or provide Executive with (i) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to two times the sum of (1) the greater of (a) his then-current base salary or (b) his base salary in effect as of the date immediately preceding the Effective Date and (2) the greater of (a) his then-current target annual bonus or (b) the greater of the average annual bonus (i) received by Executive or (ii) target for Executive, for two fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the date of termination of employment; and (ii) subject to Executive's continued co-payment of premiums, continued participation for two years in all health and welfare plans which cover Executive (and eligible dependents) upon the same terms and conditions (except for the requirements of Executive's continued employment) in effect on the date of termination (or as amended from time to time).  The continuation of health benefits under this subsection shall not reduce or count against Executive's rights under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA").  Any termination payments made and benefits provided under this Agreement to Executive shall be in lieu of any termination or severance payments or benefits for which Executive may be eligible under any of the plans, policies or programs of the Employing Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates (other than benefits under the Company's employee benefit plans that by their terms survive termination of employment and COBRA benefits).
The payments made to Executive under this Section 3 shall be made as soon as practical after his termination of employment; provided, that if and to the extent so required under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, such payment or any applicable portion thereof shall be made no earlier than 6 months after the date of termination (or the date of Executive's death, if earlier).
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Separation shall not be deemed a "termination of employment" for any purpose under this Section 3, so long as his employment continues through the effective date of the Separation and he is employed immediately after the Separation by the Company as contemplated in Section 1(b).
 
4
 
For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean: (i) conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving dishonesty, theft, fraud or moral turpitude; Executive's violation of Employing Company's Code of Ethical conduct; or other willful misconduct conduct, that in each case, is materially and demonstrably injurious to Parent or the Company, or any of their affiliates, as applicable, monetarily or otherwise; or (ii) willful failure or refusal by Executive to substantially follow his reasonably assigned duties with the Employing Company or to follow the proper written direction of the CEO or Board, as applicable, after a written notice of demand is delivered to Executive by the CEO or Board, as applicable, which remains uncured for fifteen (15) days after written notice is given to Executive.  The Company must notify Executive of an event constituting "Cause" within 90 days following the knowledge of its existence or such event shall not constitute Cause under this Agreement.
        Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
5.
                                      
(a)              If it shall be determined that any payment or distribution of any type to or in respect of Executive, by the Company or any other person, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the "Total Payments"), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any interest or penalties are incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes) imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the total Payments.
Gross-UP Payment.
(b)
                                
Determination by Accountant.
(1)                   All computations and determinations relevant to this Section shall be made by a national accounting firm selected by the Company from among the five (5) largest accounting firms in the United States (the "Accounting Firm"), and reasonably acceptable to Executive, which firm may be the Company's accountants.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Such determinations shall include whether any of the Total Payments are "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code).  In making the initial determination hereunder as
 
5
 
to whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the Accounting Firm shall be required to determine that no Gross-Up Payment is required if, but only if, the Accounting Firm (A) concludes that (i) there has not occurred a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code) or (ii) no portion of the total Payments constitutes "parachute payments" (within the meaning of said Section 280)G), in either case on the basis of "substantial authority" (within the meaning of Section 6230 of the Code), and (B) provides an opinion to that effect to both the Company and Executive, including the reasons therefore and an option that Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal income tax return.  If the Accounting Firm determines that a Gross-Up Payment is required, the Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed supporting calculations regarding the amount of any Gross-Up Payment and any other relevant matter both to the Company and Executive by no later than ten (10) days following the Date of Termination, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company or Executive (if Executive reasonably believes that any of the Total Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax).
(2)                   If a Gross-Up Payment is determined to be payable, it shall be paid to Executive within 20 days after the Determination is delivered to the Company by the Accounting Firm.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive, absent manifest error.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Gross-up Payment shall be made as soon as practicable following a determination by the Internal Revenue Service that any portion for the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax.
(3)                   As a result of uncertainly in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments not made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made by the company which should not have been made ("Overpayments").  In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred.  In the case of an Underpayment, the amount of such Underpayment (together with any interest and penalties payable by Executive as a result of such Underpayment) shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive.
 
6
 
(4)                   In the case of any Overpayment, Executive shall, at the direction and expense of the Company, take such steps as are reasonably necessary (including the filing of returns and claims for refund), follow reasonable instructions from, and procedures established by, the Company, and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company to correct such Overpayment, provided, however, that (i) Executive shall not in any event be obligated to return to the Company and amount greater than the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment that he has retained or as recovered as a refund from the applicable taxing authorities and (ii) this provision and all other provisions in this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent of this Section, which is to make Executive whole, on an after-tax basis, from the application of the Excise Taxes, it being acknowledged and understood that the correction of an Overpayment may result in Executive repaying to the Company and amount which is less than Overpayment.
(5)                   Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service relating to the possible application of the Excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code to any of the payments and amounts referred to herein and shall afford the Company, at its expense, the opportunity to control the defense of such claims.
(6)                   Executive shall cooperate with any reasonably requests by the company in connection with any contests or disputes with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the Excise Tax and shall be reimbursed by the Company, on an after-tax basis, for all costs, expenses, interest and penalties incurred by Executive in connection with any such contest or dispute.
5.             RELEASE. Any and all amounts payable and benefits or additional rights provided pursuant to this Agreement upon Executive's termination of employment, beyond Accrued Amounts, shall only be payable if Executive delivers to the Employing Company a general release of all claims of Executive occurring up to the release date in the form of Exhibit A hereto (with such changes therein as may be necessary to make it valid and encompassing under applicable law) within 21 days of presentation thereof by the Employing Company to Executive.
6.             (a)           CONFIDENTIALITY.  Executive agrees that he shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise
 
7
 
communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Employing Company, either during the period of Executive's employment or at any time thereafter, any nonpublic, proprietary or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Employing Company, any of its subsidiaries, affiliated companies or businesses, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's employment by the Employing Company. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any representative of Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that Executive provides the Employing Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and reasonably cooperates with the Employing Company at its expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).  Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, Executive's obligation to maintain such disclosed information in confidence shall not terminate where only portions of the information are in the public domain.
(b)           NONSOLICITATION.  During Executive's employment with the Employing Company and for the one year period thereafter, Executive agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, knowingly solicit, aid or induce (i) any managerial level employee of the Employing Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to leave such employment in order to accept employment with or render services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity unaffiliated with the Employing Company or knowingly take any action to materially assist or aid any other person, firm, corporation or other entity in identifying or hiring any such employee or (ii) any customer of the Employing Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to purchase goods or services then sold by the Employing Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or assist or aid any other persons or entity in identifying or soliciting any such customer.
(c)           NONCOMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that he performs services of a unique nature for the Employing Company that are irreplaceable, and that his performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Employing Company. Accordingly, during Executive's employment by the Employing Company hereunder and for the one year period thereafter, Executive agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by (whether as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, and whether or not for compensation) or render services to any person, firm, corporation or other entity, in whatever form, engaged in any business of the same type as any business in which the Employing Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is
 
8
 
engaged on the date of termination or in which they have proposed, on or prior to such date, to be engaged in on or after such date and in which Executive has been involved to any extent (other than de minimis) at any time during the 12-month period ending with the date of termination, in any locale of any country in which the Employing Company conducts business. This Section 6(c) shall not prevent Executive from owning not more than one percent of the total shares of all classes of stock outstanding of any publicly held entity engaged in such business, nor will it restrict Executive from rendering services to charitable organizations, as such term is defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.  In addition, Parent acknowledges and agrees that Executive's continued employment by the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates following the Separation shall not be deemed to violate the restrictions of this Section 6(c) as applicable to Executive's employment by Parent.
(d)           NONDISPARAGEMENT. Each of Executive and the Employing Company (for purposes hereof, Employing Company shall mean only the executive officers and directors thereof and not any other employees) agrees not to make any public statements that disparage the other party, or in the case of the Employing Company, its respective affiliates, employees, officers, directors, products or services.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) shall not be subject to this Section 6(d).
                                (e)           EQUITABLE RELIEF AND OTHER REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Employing Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Employing Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
(f)            REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in this Section 6 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state.
(g)           SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Section 5 shall survive the termination or expiration of Executive's employment with the Employing Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.
9
7.             ASSIGNMENTS.
(a)           This Agreement is personal to each of the parties hereto. Except as provided in Section 7(b) below, no party may assign or delegate any rights or obligations hereunder without first obtaining the written consent of the other party hereto.
(b) Parent or Company (as applicable) may assign this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the "Healthcare" business segment (before the Separation) or the Company (thereafter); provided that Parent or Company (as applicable) shall require such successor to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Parent or Company (as applicable) would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
7.             NOTICE.  For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) on the date of delivery if delivered by hand, (ii) on the date of transmission, if delivered by confirmed facsimile, (iii) on the first business day following the date of deposit if delivered by guaranteed overnight delivery service, or (iv) on the fourth business day following the date delivered or mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any form, award, plan or policy of Parent or Company, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
10.           SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity of unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.
11.           COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instruments.

Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction. The Employing Company shall bear all costs and expenses arising in connection with any arbitration proceeding

14.           LIABILITY INSURANCE. The Employing Company shall cover Executive under directors and officers liability insurance both during his employment by the Employing Company and, while potential liability exists, thereafter in the same amount and to the same extent as the Employing Company covers its other officers and directors.

17.           WITHHOLDING.  The Employing Company may withhold from any and all amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
18.           COMPLIANCE WITH CODE SECTION 409AIf payment or provision of any amount or benefit hereunder at the time specified in this Agreement would fail to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code because Executive is treated as a "specified" employee (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code), then such amount or benefit shall not be paid or provided at the time otherwise specified in this Agreement, but instead shall be paid or provided on the date that is six (6) months after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of Executive's death). In addition, to the extent that any regulations or guidance issued under Code 409A (after application of the previous provision of this paragraph) would result in Executive being subject to the payment of interest or any additional tax under Code 409A, the Employing Company and Executive agree, to the extent reasonably possible, to amend this Agreement in order to avoid the imposition of any such interest or additional tax under Code 409A, which amendment shall have the minimum economic effect necessary on Executive and be reasonably determined in good faith by the Employing Company and Executive.
