FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
PEMBROKE, Bermuda  Jan. 18, 2007  Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC; BSX: TYC) today announced that it filed documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register equity securities (on SEC Form 10) for Tyco Electronics and Tyco Healthcare, and debt offerings (on SEC Form S-1) for all three entities  together known as the "Registration Statements"  in connection with its upcoming separation into three independent, publicly-traded companies.  Tyco announced in January of 2006 its intent to divide the company's portfolio of diverse businesses that generated $41 billion in net revenue in fiscal 2006, into three independent companies through tax-free stock dividends to Tyco shareholders  after which they will own 100 percent of the equity in three public companies.   Subject to review by the SEC and subsequent Registration Statement effectiveness, the separation is expected to occur early in the second calendar quarter of 2007.
The Registration Statements provide details about each company's structure and risks, and include an overview of the markets and industries in which the companies will operate, the management and boards of directors, along with each company's financial statements.
