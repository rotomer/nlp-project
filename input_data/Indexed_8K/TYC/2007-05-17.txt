Exhibit 99.1
TYCO ANNOUNCES EARLY RESULTS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN TENDER OFFERS AND CONSENT SOLICITATIONS
 Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco") (NYSE: TYC; BSX: TYC) today announced early results in connection with the tender offers of Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA") for its outstanding non-convertible, Dollar-denominated public debt set forth in the table below (collectively, the "Notes") and that the deadline for holders to tender the Notes to be eligible to receive the Total Consideration (defined below) has expired.
PEMBROKE, Bermuda May 17, 2007
The amount tendered through such time under each of the relevant indentures governing the Notes, approximately 33.29% for the June 9, 1998 indenture and approximately 33.79% for the 6.0% notes due 2013, is less than the number of consents required to approve the amendments to the applicable indentures.  The proposed amendments with respect to the applicable indenture will not become effective unless TIGSA receives the requisite consent of holders of the Notes.
the holders of at least a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the June 9, 1998 indenture, voting together as one class, and the holders of at least a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6% notes due 2013, consent to the amendments to the indentures under which those Notes were issued.
The table below sets forth the results of the tender offers and consent solicitations for the Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 17, 2007, which was the deadline for holders to tender their Notes to be eligible to receive the Total Consideration, which includes the early consent payment of $30.00 per $1000 principal amount of Notes.  Approval of the applicable proposed amendments requires that
All withdrawal rights of tendering holders have terminated.  Accordingly, tendering holders may no longer withdraw their Notes.  Holders who tender their Notes after 5:00 p.m., New York City time on May 17, 2007, but before 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May 24, 2007, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated (the "Expiration Date"), will be eligible to receive the Total Consideration less the early consent payment of $30.00.  Holders who tender Notes must also deliver consents to the proposed indenture amendments.
 
 
Tyco stated that it reserves its right to waive the condition that the holders of at least a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the June 9, 1998 indenture, voting together as one class, and the holders of at least a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6% notes due 2013, consent to the amendments to the indentures under which those Notes were issued.  If it obtains the requested consents, or decides to waive the majority consent condition, Tyco will purchase all validly tendered Notes and pay for all validly delivered consents as indicated in the Offer to Purchase.  As previously disclosed, Tyco and the Company do not believe that the separation of Tyco into three separate public companies is prohibited by the indentures.  Tyco noted that the timing of the proposed separation will not be affected by the results of the offers.
The tender offers for all of the Notes remain open and are scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time on Thursday, May 24, 2007, unless extended or earlier terminated.
The total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the "Total Consideration") will equal the present value of the remaining interest and principal payments on the Notes, calculated as set forth in the tender offer and consent solicitation document, based on a yield to maturity of the U.S. Treasury reference security (the "UST Reference Security") for the Notes (the "Reference Yield") plus the fixed spread indicated in the tender offer and consent solicitation document.
The Dealer Managers will calculate the Reference Yield in accordance with standard market practice based on the bid-side price of the UST Reference Security for the Notes as displayed on the relevant Bloomberg pages as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, two business days prior to the Expiration Date.  Tyco expects to publicly announce the pricing information for the tender offers via subsequent press release.
Each of the tender offers is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, as specified in the tender offer and consent solicitation document.
Payment in respect of the tender offers and consent solicitations will be made promptly after the Expiration Date, if the Notes are accepted for payment.
