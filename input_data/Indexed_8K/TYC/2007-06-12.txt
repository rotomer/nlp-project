Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
  On June 7, 2007, the Board of Directors of Tyco International Ltd. (the "Company") authorized the divestiture of the Power Systems business of the Tyco Electronics Segment and delegated to the Chief Executive Officer of Tyco Electronics the authority to determine whether or not to proceed with the divestiture of Power Systems based on the specific terms and conditions of any sale proposal. As a result, the Company assessed the Power Systems assets for impairment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, and determined the Power Systems assets are impaired. The Company currently estimates that the impairment is approximately $500 million pre-tax and $370 million after-tax. The Company expects to record the impairment charge in the three month period ended June 29, 2007.
