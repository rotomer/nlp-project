TYCO INTERNATIONAL INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND 36 PERCENT TO 15 CENTS PER SHARE; INITIATES NEW $1 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
PEMBROKE, BermudaSeptember 13, 2007Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC, BSX: TYC) announced today that its Board of Directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly dividend to 15 cents per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The new quarterly dividend represents a 36% increase over the quarterly dividend of approximately 11 cents that the company previously indicated it expected to pay following the separation of Tyco into three public companies. The 15-cent dividend for the first quarter will be payable on November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2007.
Separately, the Board authorized a new program to purchase up to $1 billion of the company's common stock. The company expects to repurchase shares from time to time based on market conditions.
Tyco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen said: "The increase in our quarterly dividend and the initiation of a new share repurchase program reflect the strength of our cash flow and our confidence in Tyco's future. With the separation behind us, this is the appropriate time for us to make these moves."
