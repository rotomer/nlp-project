"Losses" shall not include special, incidental or consequential damages (other than consequential or incidental damages payable to a third party), including lost profits or loss of business opportunity.
(b)
        
If the Indemnified Party actually recognizes a Tax Benefit on account of a Loss or Tax subject to indemnification under this
ARTICLE XIII
or
ARTICLE IX

In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made at any time within two (2) years of an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Loss or Tax (as applicable), then, to the extent of the amount of such indemnification payment, a refund equal to the aggregate net amount of the recovery (less the costs of recovery to the Indemnified Party, including any increase in premiums or similar costs) shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payment to such Indemnified Party.  The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of any Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses or Taxes indemnified by such Indemnifying Party.
 
(d)
        
In computing the amount of any Tax cost or Tax Benefit pursuant to this , the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any and all Losses or Taxes (as applicable).  For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not be construed to grant the Indemnifying Party any right to review the Tax Returns of the Indemnified Party.
