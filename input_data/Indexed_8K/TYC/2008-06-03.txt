FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
PEMBROKE, Bermuda  June 2, 2008  Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC, BSX: TYC) (the "Company") today announced the expiration, as of  5:00 p.m. New York time, on June 2, 2008, of the previously announced consent solicitation and exchange offer of each series of notes issued under the Company's 1998 and 2003 indentures.  The Company accepted all consents and notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the consent solicitations and exchange offer.
 
As a result of having previously received the requisite consents, and based on the waiver of any alleged defaults or events of default that may have arisen prior to April 11, 2008, the Company has taken the necessary steps to dismiss the proceeding entitled pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  On April 30, 2008, the court entered an order dismissing that action with prejudice.
