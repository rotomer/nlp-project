"SECTION 12.2.   PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS.

unless the Company, Tyco or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. In the event that the Company, Tyco or such Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, as the case may be, the Company and Tyco or such Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder of Notes (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment made to a Holder of Notes to the extent:
 
(a)

(b)

(c)
                                
that any such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the presentation of such Notes or Guarantees (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or Holder thereof would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Notes or Guarantees been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period; or
 
(d)
                               
that such Holder would not be liable or subject to such withholding or deduction of Taxes but for the failure to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption, if (x) the making of such declaration or claim is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant Taxing Authority as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes, and (y) at least 60 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Company and Tyco or such Guarantor shall apply this clause (d), the Company and Tyco or such Guarantor shall have notified all Holders of Notes in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim.
 
The Company and Tyco or such Guarantor, as the case may be, will also (i) make such withholding or deduction of Taxes and (ii) remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with all applicable laws. The Company and Tyco or such Guarantor, as the case may be, will use their or its reasonable best efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Taxing Authority imposing such Taxes. The Company, Tyco or such Guarantor, as the case may be, will, upon request, make available to the Holders of the Notes, within 60 days after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Company, Tyco or such Guarantor or if, notwithstanding the Company's and Tyco's or such Guarantor's
efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence of such payments by the Company and Tyco or such Guarantor.
 
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or Guarantees is due and payable, if the Company and Tyco or such Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Company and Tyco or such Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as is necessary to enable such Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders of Notes on the payment date.
 
In addition, the Company and Tyco or such Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay any stamp, issue, registration, documentary or other similar taxes and duties, including interest, penalties and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, payable in Luxembourg, Bermuda or the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the foregoing in respect of the creation, issue, offering, enforcement, redemption or retirement of the Notes or the Guarantees.
 
The foregoing provisions shall survive any termination of or the discharge of the Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Company, Tyco or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is organized or is engaged in business for tax purposes or any political subdivisions or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
 
Whenever in the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal (and premium, if any), redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Notes or Guarantees, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof."

(a)
                                 
Indemnification by the Company and the Guarantor.
The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an Exchange Registration Statement and each of the Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in a Shelf Registration Statement against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder or Electing Holder, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" ("Issuer Information") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such holder or such Electing Holder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such person expressly for use therein.
provided, however,
(b)
                                
Indemnification by the Holders.
The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from the Electing Holder of such Registrable Securities, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company the Guarantor, and all other holders of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company the Guarantor or such other holders of Registrable Securities may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such Electing Holder, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.

provided, however,
 
(c)
                                 
Notices of Claims, Etc.
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)
                                
Contribution.
If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.
 
(e)
                                 
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder and each person, if any, who controls any holder within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantor (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act) and
the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.
