ITEM 1.01             ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
. On January 6, 2009, Tyco International Ltd. (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, collectively, the "Underwriters") under which TIFSA agreed to sell to the Underwriters $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.50% Notes due 2019 (the "Notes").
Underwriting Agreement
 
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on January 9, 2009. The Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").  The net proceeds payable from the offering of the Notes, after deducting the Underwriters' discount and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $745.0 million and will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in the Company's subsidiaries.
 
A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
.  The Notes are governed by an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of January 9, 2009, by and among TIFSA, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 9, 2009 ("Supplemental Indenture").  Copies of the Indenture and Supplemental Indenture are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
Indenture and Supplemental Indenture
 
The Notes are TIFSA's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior debt, and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TIFSA may incur. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company.
 
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 8.50% per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for.  Interest on the Notes will be payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2009, to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 1 and July 1 prior to each interest payment date.  In certain circumstances, TIFSA may be required to pay additional interest.
 
The Notes provide each holder the right to require TIFSA to repurchase all or a portion of such holder's notes on July 15, 2014 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes tendered by the holder, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The Notes are redeemable at TIFSA's option at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the series of Notes and a make-whole price, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  TIFSA also may redeem all, but not less than all, of a series of Notes in the event of certain tax changes affecting such notes.
 
Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), unless TIFSA has exercised its right to redeem the Notes, each holder of Notes will have the right to require TIFSA to purchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

(c)
          
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by (i) the Representatives, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) and (ii) by the Guarantor, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person.

(d)
          
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth herein, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to above in subsection (d) shall be deemed to include
, subject to the limitations set forth above,
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are
not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
10.
    
Termination
.  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by written notice given to the Guarantor, if after the
execution
and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Time of Delivery (i) trading
generally
shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) trading of any securities of the Guarantor shall have been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal, New York State, Bermuda or Luxembourg authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus.
 
11.
    
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
.
 
(a)
          
If, at the Time of Delivery, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder at such time, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased at such time, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase at such time; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, at the Time of Delivery any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder at such time and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased at such time, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Guarantor for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company or the Guarantor.  In any such case the Underwriters and the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph
provided
shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
(b)
          
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 (other than clause (ii) thereof), neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be under any liability to any Underwriter pursuant to this Agreement except as provided in Section 6(h) and Section 9 hereof; but if for any other reason
the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated, including because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 is not satisfied, this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(ii) 
or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof
,
the Company and the Guarantor agree, jointly and severally, to reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives on demand for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by the Underwriters in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities, and the Company and the Guarantor shall be under no further liability except as provided in Section 6(h) and Section 9 hereof.

Each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  To the extent that the Company or
the
Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise) from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process with respect to itself or its property, each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the full extent permitted by law, such immunity in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding.
 
(b)

Judgment Currency
.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due
hereunder
into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Underwriters could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of the Company and the Guarantor with respect to any sum due from either of them to any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter of any sum in such other currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency.  If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, the Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter against such loss.  If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter agrees to pay to the Guarantor an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder.

ANNEX IV
 
The opinion of Appleby, Bermuda counsel for the Guarantor, to be delivered pursuant to Section 5(g) of the Underwriting Agreement shall be to the effect that:
 
The Company is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability and existing under the laws of Bermuda.  The Company possesses the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name and is in good standing under the laws of Bermuda.
(1)
          
 
The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Subject Agreements to which it is a party and to take all action as may be necessary to complete the transactions contemplated thereby.
(2)
          
 
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
(3)
          
 
The Subject Agreements to which the Company is a party have been duly executed by the Company and each constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
(4)
          
 
Subject as otherwise provided in this opinion, no consent, licence or authorisation of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any governmental authority or court of Bermuda is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements or to ensure the legality, validity, admissibility into evidence or enforceability as to the Company, of the Subject Agreements.
(5)
          
 
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any requirement of any law or any regulation of Bermuda or (ii) the Constitutional Documents.
(6)
          
 
The statements made in the Supplemental Prospectus under sections "Certain Luxembourg, Bermuda & United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" and "Risk Factors" under the
(7)
          
sub-heading "Bermuda law differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities", in so far as such statements constitute a summary of the Constitutional Documents or of the matters of Bermuda law referred to therein fairly and accurately represent such legal matters in all material respects.
 
The choice of the laws of the state of New York as the proper law to govern the Subject Agreements is a valid choice of law under Bermuda law and such choice of law would be recognised, upheld and applied by the courts of Bermuda as the proper law of the Subject Agreements in proceedings brought before them in relation to the Subject Agreements, provided that (i) the point is specifically pleaded; (ii) such choice of law is valid and binding under the laws of the state of New York; and (iii) recognition would not be contrary to public policy as that term is understood under Bermuda law.
(8)
          
 
The submission by the Company to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state of New York pursuant to the Subject Agreements is not contrary to Bermuda law and would be recognised by the courts of Bermuda as a legal, valid and binding submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state of New York, if such submission is accepted by such courts and is legal, valid and binding under the laws of the state of New York.
(9)
          
 
A final and conclusive judgment of a competent foreign court against the Company based upon the Subject Agreements (other than a court of jurisdiction to which The Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1958 applies, and it does not apply to the courts of the state of New York) under which a sum of money is payable (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature, in respect of a fine or other penalty, or in respect of multiple damages as defined in The Protection of Trading Interests Act 1981) may be the subject of enforcement proceedings in the Supreme Court of Bermuda under the common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the judgment of such competent foreign court.  A final opinion as to the availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the foreign court's judgment are known, but, on general principles, we would expect such proceedings to be successful provided that:
(10)
        
 
the court which gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in accordance with private international law principles as applied in Bermuda; and
(i)
   
the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Bermuda, has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice and is not based on an error in Bermuda law.
(ii)
  
 
Enforcement of such a judgment against assets in Bermuda may involve the conversion of the judgment debt into Bermuda dollars, but the Bermuda Monetary Authority has indicated that its present policy is to give the consents necessary to enable recovery in the currency of the obligation.
 
Neither the Company nor any of its assets or property enjoys, under Bermuda law, immunity on the grounds of sovereignty from any legal or other proceedings whatsoever or from enforcement, execution or attachment in respect of its obligations under the Subject Agreements.
(11)
        
 
The Company has received an assurance from the Ministry of Finance granting an exemption, until 28 March 2016, from the imposition of tax under any applicable Bermuda law computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, provided that such exemption shall not prevent the application of any such tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda and shall not prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to land in Bermuda leased to the Company.  There are, subject as otherwise provided in this opinion, no Bermuda taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, duties or similar charges now due, or which could in the future become due, in connection with the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Subject Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, or in connection with the admissibility in evidence thereof and the Company is not required by any Bermuda law or regulation to make any deductions or withholdings in Bermuda from any payment it may make thereunder

Limitation on Suits

(b)           No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given
by this Article VI or by law to the Trustee or the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.

Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith, by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, shall determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(b)           In the case of an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities, at any time before the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been declared due and payable, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series, by written notice to Parent and the Company and the Trustee,
 
shall have been remedied or waived. No such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
except non-payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series as a result of such declaration,
(c)           At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the amount due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to Parent and the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has or has caused to be paid or deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration, with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit, and (ii) any and all Events of Default under this Indenture with respect to such series,
(d)           In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.

Section 6.08           .
Waiver Of Usury, Stay Or Extension Laws
 
Each of Parent and the Company covenants, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of Parent and the Company, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Upon the execution and
delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, and such retiring Trustee shall have no further responsibility with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates for the exercise of rights and powers or for the performance of the duties and obligations vested in the Trustee under this Indenture.  Each such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates.  On request of the Company or any successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee, to the extent contemplated by such supplemental indenture, the property and funds held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates.
 
(c)           Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company may execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in Section 7.11(a) or (b), as the case may be.

CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS
 
Section 8.01           .
Evidence of Action by Securityholders
 
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing.
 
If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders of any series any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Company, at its option, as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate, may fix in advance a record date for such series for the determination of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given before or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the purposes of determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities of that series have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities of that series shall be computed as of the record date; provided, however, that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
 
Section 8.02           .
Proof of Execution by Securityholders
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
 
(a)           The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
 
(b)           The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof.
 
(c)           The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section 8.02 as it shall deem necessary.
 
Section 8.03           .
Who May be Deemed Owners
 
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security, whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar, for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
None of the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial interests.
 
Section 8.04           .
Certain Securities Owned by Company Disregarded
 
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent of waiver under this Indenture, the Securities of that series that are owned by Parent, the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by an Affiliate of Parent or the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. The Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section 8.04, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not an Affiliate. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee.  Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities of a particular series, if any known by Parent or the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above described Persons and, subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities of such particular series not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
 
Section 8.05           .
Actions Binding on Future Securityholders
 
At any time prior to the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, may revoke such action so far as
concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series.

(f)            to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture, provided that any such change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision;
(g)           to secure the Securities of any series;

(j)            to issue additional Securities of any series; provided that such additional Securities have the same terms as, and be deemed part of the same series as, the applicable series of Securities issued hereunder to the extent required by Section 2.01(b); or
 
(k)           to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust hereunder by more than one Trustee.

(ii) Parent or the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other amounts payable hereunder by the Company with respect to such series,
 
then, subject to Section 11.03(c), after the date such funds or Governmental Obligations, as the case may be, are deposited with the Trustee, the obligations of Parent and the Company under this Indenture with respect to such series shall cease to be of further effect except, to the extent

All payments made by Parent or the Company under or with respect to the Securities and the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Taxing Jurisdiction (""), unless Parent or the Company, as the case may be, is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof.  In the event that Parent or the Company is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the Securities or the Guarantees, as the case may be, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts ("") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder of Securities (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment to a holder of Securities or a holder of a beneficial interests in Global Securities where such holder

is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or business in the Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment in the Taxing Jurisdiction;
(i)

owns or owned 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Parent or the Company;
(iv)
                             
 
(b)           any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise or personal property Taxes imposed with respect to the Securities, except as otherwise provided herein;
 
(c)           any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the presentation of such Securities (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is
duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder thereof would have been entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had the Securities been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;
 
(d)           any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the failure of such holder or any other person to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction of such holder, if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes;
 
(e)           with respect to withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, any such Taxes imposed by reason of the failure of such holder to fulfill the statement requirements of sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code;
 
(f)            any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by the Parent or the Company or any paying agent from payments in respect of such Securities;
 
(g)           any Taxes required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of any Securities if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
 
(h)           any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, or any amendment thereof, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, that Directive or the Luxembourg Law of December 23, 2005, as amended;

Additional Amounts will not be payable to or for the account of any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Security if such payment would not be subject to such withholding or deduction of Taxes but for the failure of a Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Security to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption or to provide a certificate declaring its non-residence, if the Company were treated as a domestic corporation under United States federal income tax and if (x) the making of such declaration or claim or the provision of such certificate is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant Taxing Authority as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes, and (y)  at least 60 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which Tyco or the Company shall apply this paragraph, Tyco or the Company shall have notified all Holders of Securities in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim.
Additional Amounts also will not be payable to any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Security that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or to such holder that is not the sole Holder or holder of such beneficial interests of such Security, as the case may be.  This exception, however, will apply only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member  received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment.
 
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will also (i) make such withholding or deduction of Taxes and (ii) remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with all applicable laws.  Parent or the Company, as applicable, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Taxing Authority imposing such Taxes.  Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will, upon request, make available to the holders of the Securities, within 90 days after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by Parent or the Company or if, notwithstanding Parent's or the Company's efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence of such payments by Parent or the Company.
 
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Securities or Guarantees is due and payable, if Parent or the Company will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, Parent or the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information as is necessary to enable such Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of Securities on the payment date.
 
In addition, the Company will pay any stamp, issue, registration, documentary or other similar taxes and duties, including interest, penalties and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, payable in Luxembourg or the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the foregoing in respect of the creation, issue, offering, enforcement, redemption or retirement of the Securities.
 
The provisions of this Article XIV shall survive any termination of the discharge of this Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company or any successor Person to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, is organized or is engaged in business for tax purposes or any political subdivisions or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein; provided, however, the date on which Parent or the Company changes its jurisdiction in which it is organized or such Person becomes a successor to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall be substituted for the date on which the series of Securities was issued.
 
Whenever in this Indenture, the Securities or the Guarantees there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal and premium, if any, redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Security, such mention shall be deemed to include
mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
 
ARTICLE XV.
 
GUARANTEES
 
Section 15.01         .
Guarantee
 
Parent hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees (i) to each Holder of each Security that is authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, and (ii) to the Trustee on behalf of such Holder, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Security when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of such Security and of this Indenture.  In case of the failure of the Company punctually to make any such payment, Parent hereby agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the stated maturity or by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company.
 
Parent hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, the validity, regularity or enforceability of such Security or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same or any release, amendment, waiver or indulgence granted to the Company or Parent or any consent to departure from any requirement of any other guarantee of all or any of the Securities or any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor.  Parent hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or any of the Holders protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest in or other lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Company or any other Person or any collateral, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Security except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Security and in such Guarantee.  Parent agrees that if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or any of the Holders of the applicable series of Securities are prevented by applicable law from exercising their respective rights to accelerate the maturity of such Securities, to collect interest on such Securities, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to such Securities, Parent agrees to pay to the Trustee for the account of such Holders, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Trustee or any of such Holders.
 
Parent shall be subrogated to all rights of the holders of the Securities against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by Parent on account of such Security pursuant to the provisions of its Guarantee or this Indenture; provided, however, that Parent shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payment arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until
the principal of and interest on all Securities of such series issued hereunder shall have been paid in full.
 
The Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of such Securities, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any holder of such Securities, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made.  In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, such Securities shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
 
Any term or provision of the Guarantee to the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate amount of the obligations guaranteed hereunder shall be reduced to the extent necessary to prevent such Guarantee from violating or becoming voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
 
Section 15.02         .
Execution and Delivery of Guarantee
 
The Guarantee shall include the terms of the Guarantee set forth in Section 15.01 and shall be substantially in the form established pursuant to Section 2.16.  Parent hereby agrees to execute its Guarantee, in a form established pursuant to Section 2.16, on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
 
The Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of Parent by any one of its chairman of the Board of Directors, president, vice presidents or other person duly authorized by Parent's Board of Directors.  The signature of any or all of these persons on the Guarantee may be manual or facsimile.
 
A Guarantee bearing the manual or facsimile signature of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of Parent shall bind Parent, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of any Security or did not hold such offices at the date of such Guarantee.
 
The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantee on behalf of Parent and shall bind Parent notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantee does not bear the signature of Parent.  Parent agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 15.01 and in the form of Guarantee established pursuant to Section 2.16 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to execute a Guarantee on any such Security.
Section 15.03         .
Release of Guarantee
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Article XV to the contrary, concurrently with the payment in full of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Securities of a series, Parent shall be released from and relieved of its obligations under this Article XV with respect to the Securities of such series.  Upon the delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the transaction giving rise to the release of this Guarantee was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the Securities, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of Parent from its obligations under this Guarantee.  If any of the obligations to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities and all other obligations of the Company are revived and reinstated after the termination of this Guarantee, then all of the obligations of Parent under this Guarantee shall be revived and reinstated as if this Guarantee had not been terminated until such time as the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities are paid in full, and Parent shall enter into an amendment to this Guarantee, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, evidencing such revival and reinstatement.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed all as of the day and year first above written.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, Parent, the Company and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and proportionate benefit of the respective holders from time to time of the Offered Securities as follows:
 
ARTICLE I
 
Section 1.1.
                                  
Terms of Offered Securities
.
 
The following terms relate to the Offered Securities:
 
The Offered Securities constitute a series of securities having the title "8.50% Notes due 2019".
(1)
                                 
 
The initial aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Base Indenture (except for Offered Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Offered Securities pursuant to Section 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.11, or 3.03) is $750,000,000.
(2)
                                 
 
The entire Outstanding principal of the Offered Securities shall be payable on January 15, 2019.
(3)
                                 
 
 
(A)The rate at which the Offered Securities shall bear interest initially shall be 8.50% per year (the "") ..  The date from which interest shall accrue on the Offered Securities shall be January 9, 2009, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for.  The Interest Payment Dates for the Offered Securities shall be January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2009.  Interest shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 1 and July 1 prior to each Interest Payment Date (a "").  The basis upon which interest shall be calculated shall be that of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
(4)
                                 
                             
Original Interest Rate
regular record date
 
The interest rate payable on the Offered Securities shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody's or S&P or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Offered Securities, in the manner described in this Section 1.1(4)(B).  If the rating (or its equivalent in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) from Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) of the Offered Securities is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall increase such that it shall equal the Original Interest Rate plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
(B)
                               
 
 
If the rating (or its equivalent in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) from S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency) of the Offered Securities is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall increase such that it shall equal the Original Interest Rate plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on the Offered Securities has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating (or its equivalent in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) of the Offered Securities to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Offered Securities shall equal the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase in rating.  If Moody's (or any Substitute
Rating Agency) subsequently increases its rating of the Offered Securities to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, and S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof) increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall be decreased to the Original Interest Rate.  In addition, the interest rates on the Offered Securities shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies) if the Offered Securities become rated A3 and A- (or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher by Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Offered Securities are only rated by one rating agency).
 
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments.  In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Offered Securities be reduced to below the Original Interest Rate or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Offered Securities exceed 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
 
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Offered Securities shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Offered Securities.  If at any time Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Offered Securities for a reason beyond the Parent's control, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Offered Securities from a Substitute Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Rating Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Offered Securities pursuant to the tables above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency shall be substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of the Offered Securities but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative rating scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt shall be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) of this sentence) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency).  For so long as only one of Moody's or S&P provides a rating of the Offered Securities, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Offered Securities necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above.  For so long as none of Moody's, S&P or a Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Offered Securities, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
 
Any interest rate increase or decrease described in this Section 1.1(4)(B) shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an
adjustment in the interest rate.

if such event of default under such indenture or instrument shall be remedied or cured by the Company or Parent or waived by the requisite holders of such Indebtedness, then the Event of Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee or any of the Securityholders; and
(1)
                                 
subject to the provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any such event of default unless written notice thereof shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, by the holder or an agent of the holder of any such Indebtedness, by the trustee then acting under any indenture or other instrument under which such default shall have occurred, or by the Holders of not less than 25% in the aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series.

("Parent") and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 9, 2009 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), by and among the Company, Parent and the Trustee.  The Base Indenture as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture is referred to herein as the "Indenture."  By the terms of the Base Indenture, the debt securities issuable thereunder are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Base Indenture.  This security is one of the series designated on the face hereof (individually, a "Security," and collectively, the "Securities"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee, the Company, Parent and the holders of the Securities (the "Securityholders").  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given them in the Base Indenture or the First Supplemental Indenture, as applicable.

The Company will pay interest semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each such day, an "Interest Payment Date").  If any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or maturity date of this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.  Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance; provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Security is authenticated between a regular record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; and provided, further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be July 15, 2009.
