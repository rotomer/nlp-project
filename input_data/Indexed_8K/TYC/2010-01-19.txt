Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Merger Agreement
 
On January 18, 2010, Tyco International Ltd. (the "Company") announced that the Company, Barricade Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, ADT Security Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), providing for the acquisition of BHS by the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of all parties, BHS will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of BHS common stock, other than shares owned by the Company, BHS or any of their respective subsidiaries (which will be cancelled), will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the BHS shareholder holding such common stock:
 
(1) $42.50 in cash, without interest, subject to proration to maintain cash consideration in the transaction at no greater than $584,502,942,
plus an amount determined by multiplying $12.75 by the number of BHS options that are exercised prior to closing (the "Available Cash Amount") (or 30% of the total merger consideration);
 
(2) a combination of $12.75 in cash, without interest, and a fraction of a Company share equal to $29.75 divided by the volume weighted average price of the Company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange during the 10-day period ending on the fourth full trading day prior to the closing date of the Merger, subject to a collar of between $32.97 and $40.29; or
 
(3) Company shares equal to $42.50 divided by the volume weighted average price of the Company's shares described in clause (2) above, subject to the same collar described in clause (2) above.
 
As noted above, in the event that the cash consideration to be paid to BHS shareholders in the transaction exceeds the Available Cash Amount, shareholders making an all cash election will receive a mix of cash and stock for their shares of BHS common stock in amounts that allow the overall cash consideration to be paid by the Company to be capped at the Available Cash Amount.  Shares of BHS common stock with respect to which no election is timely made will be treated as having elected to receive mixed consideration in the manner described above in clause (2) of the second paragraph.  There is no limit on the number of shares of BHS common stock with respect to which the holders thereof may elect to receive solely Company shares as merger consideration.
 
The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by a majority of BHS's shareholders and (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("HSR").  The consummation of the Merger will not require a vote of the Company's shareholders.
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants, including covenants providing for each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated and, with respect to BHS, (i) not to solicit alternative transactions and (ii) to call and hold a special shareholders' meeting promptly upon the receipt of HSR clearance and recommend the approval of the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that upon the termination of the Merger Agreement by BHS in connection with BHS entering into an alternative acquisition agreement with a third party, BHS will owe the Company a cash termination fee of $45
million.  Upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances where there has been a change in the BHS board of directors' recommendation arising from events other than an alternative acquisition proposal, BHS will owe the Company a cash termination fee of $87.5 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Schaffhausen, Switzerland and Irving, Texas, January 18, 2010 
Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC) and Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CFL) today announced a definitive agreement for Tyco to acquire Brink's Home Security Holdings, now operating as Broadview Security.  Following the closing of the transaction, Tyco intends to combine Broadview with Tyco's ADT security business. The cash and stock transaction is valued at $42.50 per share or approximately $2.0 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company.
 
The transaction combines two of the premier companies in the North American residential and commercial security industry. Broadview Security is one of the leading monitored security companies in North America. ADT is the world's largest electronic security provider. Tyco intends to combine the two businesses under the ADT name.
 
Excluding transaction and integration-related expenses, Tyco expects the transaction to become accretive to earnings before special items by approximately $0.07 in the first full year after closing, increasing to approximately $0.14 in year two. The combination is expected to result in operating synergies of approximately $150 million.
 
"This transaction provides us the opportunity to further strengthen our position in the residential and commercial security industry, while advancing Tyco's overall strategy to increase its presence in its core security, fire and flow control platforms," said Tyco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen.  "Broadview's strong presence in the North American security market, significant recurring revenue and attractive margins will enhance ADT's financial performance and support our long-term growth in this large, fragmented and highly competitive industry."
 
Bob Allen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadview said, "We are proud of all we have achieved as a company to increase our customer base, and to grow our
 
revenue and income in a challenging economy.  We view this transaction as the culmination of these efforts, providing our shareholders with an attractive premium for their shares, including cash consideration and an opportunity to participate in the future growth of Tyco International."
 
"ADT and Broadview are an excellent strategic fit. We have highly complementary product and service offerings, strong sales and marketing organizations and a shared dedication to quality customer service," said Naren Gursahaney, President of ADT Worldwide.  "We expect this combination to result in an even more efficient, more successful ADT."
 
Broadview Security has more than 1.3 million recurring revenue accounts throughout North America with annualized revenue of approximately $565 million.  ADT has more than 7.4 million recurring revenue accounts globally and generated revenue of $7.0 billion in fiscal 2009. ADT's North American residential and small business operation, which is the most comparable to Broadview, has 4.8 million recurring revenue accounts and revenue of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009.
 
TRANSACTION TERMS
 
Under the terms of the agreement, for each Brink's Home Security Holdings share, Brink's Home Security Holdings shareholders may elect to receive: (1) $42.50 in cash, subject to proration if the elections would result in total cash consideration exceeding approximately 30% of the total merger consideration as described in further detail below; (2) a combination of $12.75 in cash and a fraction of a Tyco share equal to $29.75 divided by the volume-weighted average price of Tyco's stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the 10-trading day period ending on the fourth full trading day prior to the closing date of the merger, subject to a collar between $32.97 and $40.29; or (3) Tyco shares equal to $42.50 divided by the volume-weighted average price described in (2) above, subject to the same collar. The stock component of the consideration is expected to be tax-free to Brink's Home Security shareholders.  As noted above, in the event the cash consideration to be paid to Brink's Home Security shareholders in the transaction exceeds approximately 30% of the total merger consideration, which is equal to approximately $584.5 million, plus an amount determined by multiplying $12.75 by the number of Brink's Home Security options that are exercised prior to closing (the "Available Cash Amount"), shareholders making a cash election will receive a mix of cash and Tyco shares for their shares of Brink's Home Security common stock in amounts that allow the overall cash consideration to be paid by Tyco to be capped at the Available Cash Amount.
 
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of Tyco's fiscal year, which began on September 26, 2009. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the approval of Brink's Home Security Holdings shareholders.

SAFE HARBOR
 
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties related to the benefits from, or completion of, the proposed merger transaction. Such risks and uncertainties, include, but are not limited to: failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed merger transaction, adverse effects on the market price of our common stock and on our operating results because of a failure to complete the proposed merger transaction, failure to realize the expected benefits of the proposed merger transaction, negative effects of announcement or consummation of the proposed merger transaction on the
 
market price of our common stock, significant transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities and general economic and business conditions that affect the combined companies following the proposed merger transaction; unanticipated expenses such as litigation or legal settlement expenses, and tax law changes. Actual results could differ materially. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with Tyco's and Brink's Home Security Holdings' businesses, please refer to the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Risk Factors" sections of Tyco's and Brink's Home Security Holdings' respective SEC filings, including, but not limited to, their respective annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained, with respect to Tyco, by contacting Investor Relations Department, Tyco International Management Company, 9 Roszel Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 or at Tyco's Investor Relations website at http://investors.tyco.com/ under the heading "Investor Relations" and then under the heading "SEC Filings" and with respect to Brink's Home Security Holdings, by contacting Investor Relations, Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc., at 8880 Esters Boulevard, Irving, Texas 75063 or at Brink's Home Security Holdings' Investor Relations website at http://www.investors.brinkshomesecurity.com.

Tyco has provided forward-looking statements regarding the impact that the proposed merger will have on its income from continuing operations before special items (referred to above as earnings before special items), which is a non-GAAP measure and excludes the impact of integration and transaction-related expenses and charges. Tyco's estimate of its income from continuing operations before special items also excludes special items such as charges and gains related to divestitures, restructurings, impairments, legacy legal and tax charges and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends of the company. Tyco uses income from continuing operations before special items to assess overall operating performance, and to provide insight to management in evaluating operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. Income from continuing operations before special items is a useful measure for investors because it permits an additional meaningful comparison of Tyco's underlying operating results and business trends between periods. The difference between income from continuing operations before special items and income from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of the special items described above.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease Tyco's reported income from continuing operations. This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measure in combination with income from continuing operations before special items in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
 

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Dear Colleague:
 
Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release announcing that Tyco has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Brink's Home Security which operates under the name Broadview Security. The stock and cash transaction is valued at approximately $2.0 billion. You will be seeing and hearing more about this acquisition in the media and elsewhere in the coming days but I wanted to share with you some of my thoughts about this transaction and the benefits of combining Broadview with our ADT North America business.
 
As you know, we have consistently talked about continuing to improve our operating performance across the company while also looking for opportunities to strengthen our presence in our global Security, Fire and Flow Control platforms. While we have focused mostly on smaller bolt-on acquisitions to enhance our product and service offerings to our customers, our financial strength and flexibility allows us to consider larger opportunities like the acquisition of Broadview.
 
I am very excited about this acquisition. By combining Broadview with ADT, we have an opportunity to strengthen our position in the important and highly competitive North American residential and small business security industry. Additionally, this acquisition complements our efforts to increase our service revenue which today represents about 40 percent of Tyco's total revenue. Service revenue has been a source of stability and consistency for our company, especially during these uncertain economic times.
 
Broadview was spun off as a separate public company from its former parent The Brink's Company in 2008 as a full-service provider of residential and commercial security systems. Broadview markets, installs, services, and monitors security alarm systems to approximately 1.3 million residential and small business accounts throughout North America, and generates annual revenues of approximately $565 million. Similar to our ADT operations in North America, Broadview is a well-managed business with a strong operating platform and good returns.
 
With our complementary products and services, this acquisition is an excellent strategic fit. As we integrate these businesses under the ADT name, we will continue to focus on growing our account base and expanding our service offerings. Customer service will continue to be a top priority for the combined business.
 
The acquisition is subject to regulatory review and approval by Broadview's shareholders and we are targeting the second half of fiscal 2010 for closing. During this period, the ADT North America and Broadview teams will begin the integration planning process for combining the two companies.
 
This transaction provides us with an exciting opportunity to bring together two premier companies in the security industry to deliver great products and services to our customers and to generate solid long-term returns for our shareholders. For more information about today's announcement, I encourage you to read our press release at www.tyco.com.
 
Regards,
