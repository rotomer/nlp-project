Other Events.
 
As previously disclosed, pursuant to a proposal included in Tyco International Ltd.'s (the "Company") proxy statement for its special general meeting of shareholders held on March 11, 2009, shareholders approved a dividend in the form of a capital reduction equal to 0.93 Swiss francs (CHF) per share payable in four quarterly installments through the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2010. The fourth and final installment of the distribution, equal to CHF 0.24 per share, was paid to shareholder on or about February 24, 2010.  The US dollar amount of the dividend payment was $0.2239 per share, based on the USD/CHF exchange rate in effect on February 17, 2010 of 1.0721.
 
In connection with the payment of the final distribution, the Company amended its Articles of Association to reflect the reduction in par value of CHF 0.24 per share, effective upon their filing with the commercial register of the Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland on February 23, 2010.  As a result, the par value of each share of the Company is now CHF 7.60.
 
A copy of the amended Articles of Association is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
