(c)
          
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by (i) the Representatives, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) and (ii) by the Guarantor, in the case of parties
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
indemnified pursuant to Section 9(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person.
 
(d)
          
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth herein, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to subsection (d) were determined by pro rata
 
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to above in subsection (d) shall be deemed to include
, subject to the limitations set forth above,
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
10.
    
Termination
.  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by written notice given to the Guarantor, if after the
execution
and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Time of Delivery (i) trading
generally
shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) trading of any securities of the Guarantor shall have been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal, New York State, Swiss or Luxembourg authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus.
 
11.
    
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
.
 
(a)
          
If, at the Time of Delivery, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder at such time, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased at such time, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or
 
refused to purchase at such time; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, at the Time of Delivery any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder at such time and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased at such time, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Guarantor for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company or the Guarantor.  In any such case the Underwriters and the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
(b)
          
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 (other than clause (ii) thereof), neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be under any liability to any Underwriter pursuant to this Agreement except as provided in Section 6(h) and Section 9 hereof; but if for any other reason
the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated, including because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 5 is not satisfied, this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(ii) 
or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof
,
the Company and the Guarantor agree, jointly and severally, to reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives on demand for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by the Underwriters in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities, and the Company and the Guarantor shall be under no further liability except as provided in Section 6(h) and Section 9 hereof.

Submission to Jurisdiction; Appointment of Agent for Service.
 
(a)

Each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  To the extent that the Company or
the
Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise)
 
from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process with respect to itself or its property, each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, such immunity in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding.
 
(b)
          
Each of the Company and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System, with offices at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding described in the preceding paragraph and agrees that service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be made upon it at the office of such agent.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any other requirements of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor represents and warrants that such agent has agreed to act as its agent for service of process, and the Company and the Guarantor each agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect.
 
13.
    
Judgment Currency
.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due
hereunder
into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Underwriters could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of the Company and the Guarantor with respect to any sum due from either of them to any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter of any sum in such other currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency.  If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, the Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter against such loss.  If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter agrees to pay to the Guarantor an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder.
