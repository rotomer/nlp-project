Other Information.
 
On August 17, 2010, Edward D. Breen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tyco International Ltd. (the "Company") entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to 1,828,301 shares of Company stock issuable upon exercise of option awards scheduled to expire in 2012.  The trading plan, executed during the Company's most recent open trading window, becomes effective on September 13, 2010.  Under the plan, the options will be exercised and the underlying shares may be sold in the open market at the times specified in the plan, regardless of whether Mr. Breen becomes aware of any material non-public information concerning the Company.
 
Mr. Breen entered into the plan as part of his personal long-term financial and tax planning strategy and to provide for an orderly liquidation of the options prior to their expiration.  Assuming that all of Mr. Breen's options are exercised and the underlying shares are sold, Mr. Breen would remain well above the minimum stock ownership thresholds established by the Company's Board of Directors.  Any transactions under the 10b5-1 plan will be publicly reported through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
