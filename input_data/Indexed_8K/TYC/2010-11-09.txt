Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 9, 2010, Tyco International Ltd. (the "") and its subsidiaries Tyco International Holding S. r.l. (""), and Atkore International Group Inc. ("") entered into an Investment Agreement (the "") with CD&R Allied Holdings, L.P. (""), a newly-formed special purpose vehicle owned by affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("") related to the sale of a majority interest in the Company's Electrical and Metal Products business. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Company and Seller have agreed to sell shares of a newly-created class of cumulative convertible participating preferred stock of Atkore (the "") to the Investor for $306 million.  The Preferred Stock to be sold to Investor will initially represent 51% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Atkore immediately following the closing of the investment (the "").  Atkore is a newly-incorporated holding company formed to hold the Company's Electrical and Metal Products business.  Following the closing of the Investment, Seller will own all of the common equity of Atkore, representing the remaining 49% of Atkore's outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis), and the Company will cease to consolidate the results of the Electrical and Metal Products business within its financial statements.  The Company has guaranteed Seller's obligations under the Investment Agreement.  In connection with the Company's entry into the Investment Agreement, the Company will discontinue the previously announced spin-off of the Electrical and Metal Products business.

Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, it is anticipated that Atkore (or a subsidiary of Atkore) will incur new third-party indebtedness of up to $465 million through a combination of borrowings under a secured revolving credit agreement and the issuance of new senior secured high yield notes (or bridge financing) and use such proceeds in part to repay $400 million in existing indebtedness of the Electrical and Metal Products business.  A payment adjustment for the Investment will be made between Seller and Atkore based upon the amount of cash, third-party indebtedness and working capital of Atkore and its subsidiaries at the closing relative to a target amount.
 
The consummation of the Investment is subject to certain customary conditions, including: (i) there not having occurred a "Material Adverse Effect" on the Electrical and Metal Products business since June 25, 2010; (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and foreign antitrust clearance; and (iii) completion of a marketing period in connection with the new third-party financing arranged by Investor for the transaction.  Approval of the Company's stockholders is not required in connection with the Investment.
 
The Preferred Stock to be purchased by Investor pursuant to the Investment Agreement will rank senior to Atkore's common stock as to dividends and liquidation preference.  The Preferred Stock will have an initial liquidation preference of $306 million and entitle the holder to a dividend at a rate of 12.00% per annum on the liquidation preference, compounding quarterly and payable in cash or in additional shares of Preferred Stock at the option of Atkore.  Dividend payments will be eliminated for any prospective period prior to the tenth anniversary of the Investment if Atkore achieves certain thresholds related to its trailing twelve month EBITDA (as defined in the certificate of designations governing the Preferred Stock).  Each share of Preferred Stock generally votes on an as-converted basis, in addition to certain special consent rights, and is convertible at any time.  The Preferred Stock may not be redeemed without holder consent except after the tenth anniversary of the closing of the Investment, at which time Atkore may redeem all (but not less than all) of the Preferred Stock at its liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
 
The Investment Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of Seller and Investor.  The Investment Agreement contains customary termination rights for both Seller and Investor and provides that, upon the termination of the Investment Agreement under specific
 
circumstances relating to a material breach of the Investment Agreement by Investor or where the new third-party debt financing to be incurred in connection with the transaction is unavailable at the closing of the investment, Investor will be obligated to pay Seller a termination fee of $45 million.  Each of Investor, Atkore and Seller has agreed to provide indemnification for certain breaches of the Investment Agreement and in respect of specified liabilities.
 
Under the Investment Agreement, Seller has agreed not to compete with Atkore and its business following the closing of the Investment until two years after Seller owns less than 50% of the equity owned by Seller as of the closing of the Investment.  The non-competition provision is subject to certain exceptions, including the ability of the Company's business segments to continue to conduct their businesses as currently operated.
 
In connection with the Investment, Investor and Seller will enter into a stockholders agreement, pursuant to which Seller will be entitled to appoint three of Atkore's eight board members.  Four of the remaining directors will be designated by Investor, with the chief executive officer of Atkore serving as the eighth director.  Prior to an initial public offering, so long as either the Seller or Investor and their respective affiliates own at least 25% of the total outstanding capital stock of Atkore, the consent of such party will be needed for certain significant company actions, including liquidation and dissolution, issuance of certain equity, incurrence of significant indebtedness and the disposal of a material amount of assets (subject to specified dollar thresholds).  The stockholders agreement and related agreements provide customary registration rights to each of Seller and Investor and include certain restrictions on the ability of each of Seller and Investor to transfer the equity of Atkore held by it; however, neither Seller nor Investor are bound by any minimum period during which such party would be prohibited from selling Atkore equity.  So long as Investor and its affiliates hold more than 50% of the total outstanding capital stock of Atkore, if they propose to sell all of their equity of Atkore to an unaffiliated third party, they may require the participation of all other stockholders in such transaction provided that the proceeds of such transaction are shared by all stockholders (including Investor and its affiliates) pro rata, on an as-converted basis.
 
After the earlier of the third anniversary of the closing of the Investment or such time as the Preferred Stock ceases to accrue dividends, either Seller or Investor, so long as they and their permitted affiliate transferees own at least 25% of the outstanding equity of Atkore, shall have the right to cause the initial public offering ("") of Atkore, so long as certain conditions are satisfied or waived.  In the event that either Seller or any of its permitted transferees initiates an IPO, Investor has a right to purchase the shares held by Seller or its transferees, as applicable, and its affiliates for a purchase price based on a valuation of the Company undertaken by three independent investment banks applying certain agreed upon valuation principles.

Tax Claim
Tax Indemnified Party
Tax Indemnifying Party
 
(b)           The Tax Indemnifying Party shall control all proceedings in connection with any Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences
 
with any Tax Authority with respect thereto, and may either pay the Tax Claim and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest such Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that (i) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax Indemnified Party regularly informed as to the status of such proceedings and (ii) except as provided in , the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Claim to the extent that any such settlement or compromise could reasonably be expected to result in Liability of the Tax Indemnified Party for Taxes with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period that exceeds $50,000 without the Tax Indemnified Party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the Tax Indemnifying Party indemnifies and holds harmless the Tax Indemnified Party from and against any such Taxes (including the first $50,000 thereof) actually incurred as a result of such settlement or compromise to the extent that such Liability is reasonably anticipated at the time of such settlement or compromise and otherwise would not have been incurred.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland, November 9, 2010  Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell a 51% stake in its Electrical and Metal Products business to the private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R).  Tyco will receive total cash proceeds of approximately $720 million and will use these proceeds to accelerate share repurchases under a $1 billion program announced by the company on September 8, 2010.
 
The Electrical and Metal Products business will operate as a standalone entity under the name Atkore International ("Atkore"). Following the transaction, Tyco's ownership interest in Atkore will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
 
"This transaction is attractive for both Tyco and Atkore," said Ed Breen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tyco. "Selling a portion of this business now provides us with significant cash while preserving our ability to benefit from a subsequent divestiture of our remaining stake in Atkore as its underlying end markets strengthen. The transaction sharpens our focus on our core security, fire and flow control platforms and reduces our exposure to the cyclical steel and copper markets."
 
"The transaction also gives Atkore the opportunity to pursue its business strategy as a stand-alone entity with a strong partner that has a demonstrated track record of collaborating with management teams to help their businesses reach their full potential.  Given the strength of its brands, management team and workforce, and its excellent reputation with customers, this business is well positioned to thrive, particularly as the non-residential construction market recovers."
The transaction will result in the following:
 
                 
A CD&R-managed fund will contribute $306 million for a 51% preferred interest and Atkore will obtain $465 million in third-party financing.
                 
Tyco will recognize a gain on the transaction of approximately $200 million with a minimal tax liability.
                 
Atkore results for the fiscal first quarter of 2011 will continue to be reported in Tyco's operating income.
 
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the December-January timeframe.
 
In connection with today's announcement, Tyco intends to withdraw the registration statement the company filed recently with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the spin-off of the Electrical and Metal Products business.
 
Tyco will discuss the transaction as part of a conference call and webcast being held today to review the company's fourth quarter results for 2010 and outlook for fiscal 2011. The conference call and webcast will begin at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time and can be accessed in the following ways:
