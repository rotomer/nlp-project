The Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of January 6, 2009, by and among TIFSA, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, each dated as of January 12, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indentures"). Copies of the Supplemental Indentures are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Notes are TIFSA's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior debt, and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TIFSA may incur. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company.
 
The 2018 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.750% per year, and the 2023 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.625% per year, in each case from the date of original issuance or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest on the Notes will be payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2011, to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 1 and July 1 prior to each interest payment date.
 
Prior to January 15, 2018, in the case of the 2018 Notes, and prior to October 15, 2022, in case of the 2023 Notes, the Notes are redeemable at TIFSA's option at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the series of Notes and a make-whole price, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  On or after October 15, 2022, the 2023 Notes are redeemable at TIFSA's option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  TIFSA also may redeem all, but not less than all, of a series of Notes in the event of certain tax changes affecting such notes.
 
Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Supplemental Indentures), unless TIFSA has exercised its right to redeem the Notes, each holder of Notes will have the right to require TIFSA to purchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have examined:  (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR, File Nos. 333-153490 and 333-153490-01, as amended (the "Registration Statement"), of Tyco International Finance S.A., a Luxembourg company (the "Company"), and Tyco International Ltd., a Swiss corporation (the "Parent"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the registration of senior or subordinated debt securities of the Company, registered shares of the Parent, contracts for the purchase of debt or equity securities of the Company, the Parent or third parties, warrants for debt or equity securities of the Company, the Parent or third parties, units consisting of one or more debt securities or other securities and guarantees by the Parent of the Debt Securitie s; (ii) the prospectus dated May 1, 2009 forming a part thereof (the "Base Prospectus"), together with the documents incorporated therein by reference; (iii) the preliminary prospectus supplement dated January 5, 2011, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on January 5, 2011 (the "Preliminary Prospectus"); and (iv) the final prospectus supplement dated January 5, 2011 in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on January 6, 2011 (the "Final Prospectus" and, together with the Base Prospectus and Preliminary Prospectus, the "Prospectus") in connection with the offering and sale by the Company of its 3.750% Notes due 2018 and 4.625% Notes due 2023 (the "Debt Securities").  The Parent will issue guarantees (the "Guarantees") of the Debt Securities to the extent described in the Registration Stateme nt and the Prospectus.
 
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have examined the originals, or photostatic or certified copies, of such records of the Company and the Parent and certificates of officers of the Company and the Parent and of public officials and such other documents as we have
 
deemed relevant and necessary as the basis for the opinions set forth below.  In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.
 
We are not admitted or qualified to practice law in Luxembourg or Switzerland.  Therefore, we have relied upon the opinion of Allen & Overy Luxembourg, filed as an exhibit to the Parent's Form 8-K filed with the Commission on January 12, 2011 (the "Form 8-K"), with respect to matters governed by the laws of Luxembourg and the opinion of Vischer AG, filed as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, with respect to matters governed by the laws of Switzerland.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that (a) the Debt Securities constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and (b) the Guarantees constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the Parent.
 
The opinions expressed above are subject to the following exceptions, qualifications, limitations and assumptions:
 
A.
                                  
We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and the United States of America.  This opinion is limited to the effect of the current state of the laws of the State of New York and the United States of America and the facts as they currently exist.  We assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion in the event of future changes in such laws or the interpretations thereof or such facts.
 
B.
                                    
The opinions set forth above are each subject to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, including the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent transfers or preferential transfers, and (ii) general principles of equity, including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, and we further consent to the use of our name under the caption "Validity of the Securities" in the Registration
Statement and the prospectus that forms a part thereof. In giving these consents, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission.

(vi)
                             
that the Executed Securities will not be offered to the public in Luxembourg;
 
(vii)
                          
that the Executed Securities are and will be effective, and will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, under the laws of the State of New York by which they are expressed to be governed; and

III.          OPINION
 
Based upon, and subject to, the assumptions made above and the qualifications set out below and subject to any matters not disclosed to us, we are of the opinion that, under the laws of Luxembourg in effect, and as construed and applied by the Luxembourg courts, on the date hereof, the Executed Securities, subject to their validity, legality and enforceability under New York law by which they are expressed to be governed and subject to customary qualifications of Luxembourg law, constitute, so far as Luxembourg law is applicable legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company.
IV.          QUALIFICATIONS
 
The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications.
 
(a)
                               
The validity, legality and performance of the Executed Securities are subject to, and may be affected or limited by, the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, moratorium or reprieve from payment (), controlled management (), general settlement or composition with creditors (), fraudulent conveyance (), reorganization or similar Luxembourg or foreign laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

(b)
                               
The opinion expressed above is qualified by the fact:
 
(i)
                          
that a search at the Register is not capable of conclusively revealing whether a (and the Certificate does not constitute conclusive evidence that no) winding-up resolution or petition, or an order adjudicating or declaring a, or a petition or filing for, bankruptcy or reprieve from payment (), controlled management (), composition with creditors () or judicial liquidation () or similar action has been adopted or made.; and

(ii)
                       
that the corporate documents of, and relevant court orders affecting, a Luxembourg company (including, but not limited to, the notice of a winding-up order or resolution, notice of the appointment of a receiver or similar officer) may not be held at the Register immediately and there is generally a delay in the relevant document appearing on the files regarding the company concerned. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the required filing of documents has not occurred or that documents filed with the Register may have been mislaid or lost. In accordance with Luxembourg company law, changes or amendments to corporate documents to be filed at the Register will be effective () third parties only as of the day of their publication in the unless the company proves that the relevant third parties had prior knowledge thereof.

We express no tax opinion whatsoever in respect of the Company or the tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by the Executed Securities (or any document in connection therewith) and we express no opinion on matters of fact or on matters other than those expressly set forth in this legal opinion, and no opinion is, or may be, implied or inferred herefrom.
 
(d)
                                
Where any obligations are to be performed or observed or are based upon a matter arising in a jurisdiction outside Luxembourg, they may not be enforceable under Luxembourg law if and to the extent that such performance or observance would be unlawful, unenforceable or contrary to public policy under the laws of such jurisdiction or be contrary to International Public Policy in Luxembourg.
 
(e)
                                 
As used in this opinion, the term means that each obligation or document is of a type enforced by the Luxembourg courts. It is not certain, however, that each obligation or document will be enforced in accordance with its terms in every circumstance, enforcement being subject to, , the nature of the remedies available in the Luxembourg courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts (within the limits of Luxembourg law), the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of Luxembourg civil procedure rules regard ing remedies and enforcement measures available under Luxembourg law.

This legal opinion is given on the express basis, accepted by each person who is entitled to rely on it, that this legal opinion and all rights, obligations or liability in relation to it are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, Luxembourg law and that any action or claim in relation to it can be brought exclusively before the courts of Luxembourg. Luxembourg legal concepts are expressed in English terms and not in their original French or German terms. The concepts concerned may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English terms as they exist under the laws of other jurisdictions.
 
It should be noted that there are always irreconcilable differences between languages making it impossible to guarantee a totally accurate translation or interpretation. In particular, there are always some legal concepts which exist in one jurisdiction and not in another, and in those cases it is bound to be difficult to provide a completely satisfactory translation or interpretation because the vocabulary is missing from the language. We accept no responsibility for omissions or inaccuracies to the extent that any are attributable to such factors.

we consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhib it to the Form 8-K to be filed by the Guarantor on
12 January 2011
, and we further consent to the use of our name under the caption "Validity of the Securities" in the Registration Statement and the prospectus that forms a part thereof.

c)
                                              
Enforcement in Switzerland of judgments rendered outside Switzerland would be subject to the limitations set forth in (a) the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law (), in particular, and without limitation to the foregoing, the general principles of the Swiss ordre public as defined in Art. 17 and 18 of the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law or (b) any international treaties under which Switzerland is bound. Enforcement in Sw itzerland of judgments rendered outside Switzerland may further-more be limited if the foreign court violated fundamental procedural principles as defined in Art. 27 of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law or if such enforcement would contravene the Swiss ordre public. In particular, remedies such as an order for specific per-formance or an injunction are discretionary remedies and may not be available under the laws of Switzerland where damages are considered to be an adequate remedy. Enforcement under Swiss debt collection and bankruptcy proceedings may only be made in Swiss francs and an
