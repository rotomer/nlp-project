On October 14, 2011, upon the recommendation of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Compensation Committee") and in connection with the proposed separation of the Company into three independent publicly-traded companies (the "Separation"), the Board of Directors of Tyco International, Ltd. (the "Company") approved (i) certain modifications to outstanding equity awards held by employees of the Company, including the Company's named executive officers and (ii) the expected treatment of equity awards upon the completion of the Separation.  In addition, equity awards granted on October 12, 2011 include provisions related to the separation.
 
Awards granted prior to October 12, 2011
 
Unvested equity awards granted prior to October 12, 2011 (the date of the annual grant for fiscal year 2012), including awards held by the Company's named executive officers (other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), have been modified to provide that, for each employee whose employment is terminated by the Company in connection with the Separation prior to its one year anniversary, (1) any unvested stock option, restricted share unit or performance share unit will fully vest upon termination of employment (subject, in the case of performance share units, to the completion of the applicable performance period) and (2) the exercise period for any stock option that was granted in the period from January 1, 2008 to October 11, 2011 will be extended to comprise the one-year period following the date of such termination for such employee.  In addition, any such employee shall be entitled to full vesting of any unvested company match under the Company's Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan and shall be eligible to receive a pro-rated bonus under the Company's annual incentive plan for the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs based on the number of full months of service completed through the date of termination.  The terms of the employment agreement between Mr. Edward D. Breen, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and the Company will govern the benefits applicable to Mr. Breen with respect to these awards.
 
Awards granted on October 12, 2011
 
Awards granted on October 12, 2011 in connection with the annual grant, including awards granted to the Company's named executive officers, provide that, for each employee whose employment is terminated by the Company in connection with the Separation in the period from the grant date through the date that is one year following the completion of the Separation, any unvested stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units will accelerate and vest pro rata based on the number of full months of service completed from the grant date through the employment termination date.  Certain officers, including the Company's named executive officers, will continue to be eligible for one additional year's worth of stock option vesting if they are terminated by the Company not for "cause" after the one-year anniversary of the grant date. The one-year holding requirement will not apply to any such officer that is terminated in connection with the Separation. Any stock options subject to such accelerated vesting provisions will have a one-year exercise period following the date of such termination for such employee.  With respect to the fiscal 2012 equity award, Mr. Breen has agreed to waive the provisions of his employment agreement providing for full acceleration of his awards.
 
The form of terms and conditions for the fiscal 2012 equity awards are attached hereto as exhibits 99.1  99.3 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Treatment of outstanding equity awards upon the completion of the Separation
 
The Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved the expected treatment of outstanding equity awards held by current and former employees, to be effective only upon the completion of the proposed Separation:
(i)
                                  
for each employee in the Company's corporate segment, all outstanding stock options, and all performance share units, restricted stock units and deferred stock units that remain unvested ("Equity Awards") following the closing date of the Separation (1) that were granted prior to October 12, 2011 will, as of the closing date, convert into like-kind Equity Awards of the three separately traded companies resulting from the Separation (except that performance share units will convert into restricted stock units based on performance achieved on or about the closing date) at equivalent value determined using the intrinsic value methodology and (2) that were granted on or after October 12, 2011 will, as of the closing date, convert into like-kind Equity Awards of the separately traded company that is the employer of such employee immediately following the closing date (except that performance share units will convert into restricted stock units based on performance achieved on or about the closing date) at equivalent value determined using the intrinsic value methodology; and
 
(ii)
                               
for each employee that is not an employee in the Company's corporate segment, all Equity Awards (other than restricted stock units granted prior to October 12, 2011) held by such employee will, as of the closing date, convert into like-kind Equity Awards of the separately traded company that is the employer of such employee immediately following the closing date (except that performance share units will convert into restricted stock units based on performance achieved on or about the closing date) at equivalent value determined using the intrinsic value methodology, and, with respect to restricted stock units granted prior to October 12, 2011, such awards will, as of the closing date, convert into like-kind Equity Awards of the three separately traded companies resulting from the Separation at equivalent value determined using the intrinsic value methodology; and
 
(iii)
                            
for all persons who are former employees of the Company as of the closing date, all stock options held by such former employees will, as of the Closing Date, convert into stock options of the three separately traded companies resulting from the Separation at equivalent value determined using the intrinsic value methodology; and
 
(iv)
                             
for each member of the Board of Directors of the Company (including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), all Equity Awards held by such director will, as of the closing date, convert into like-kind Equity Awards of the three separately traded companies resulting from the Separation at equivalent value determined using the intrinsic value methodology.

Change in Control Severance Plan for Certain U. S.

Your Stock Option will expire on the earlier of (i) the original expiration date and (ii) three years from the effective date of your Change in Control Termination or your Termination of Employment by reason of a Good Reason Resignation, as described in the preceding sentence.
9.
                                      
Termination of Employment as a Result of Divestiture or Outsourcing
.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Section 7, if your involuntary Termination of Employment other than for Cause is as a result of a Disposition of Assets, Disposition of a Subsidiary or Outsourcing Agreement (each as defined below), your Stock Option will
vest on a pro-rata basis
based on the number of full months of service completed commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the date of your Termination of Employment divided by the number of full months required to achieve complete vesting (with an offset for Stock Options previously vested).
The vested portion of your Stock Option will expire on the earlier of (i) the original expiration date and (ii) three years after the date of your Termination of Employment.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be eligible for such pro-rata vesting and extended expiration date if (i) your Termination of Employment occurs on or prior to the closing date of such Disposition of Assets or Disposition of a Subsidiary, as applicable, or on such later date as is specifically provided in the applicable transaction agreement or related agreements, or on the effective date of such Outsourcing Agreement applicable to you (the "Applicable Employment Date"), and (ii) you are offered Comparable Employment (as defined below) with the buyer, successor company or outsourcing agent, as applicable, but do not commence such employment on the Applicable Employment Date.

Termination of Employment with Severance Benefits.
 
(a)   In the event of (i) your Termination of Employment that occurs within the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the date that is one year following the completion of the spin-offs of the Company's North American residential security and flow control businesses (such transaction, or any alternative transaction that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems to be substantially the same, the "Separation"), and (ii) the determination, in the sole discretion of the Senior Vice President, Human Resources (or equivalent position) of your employer, that your Termination of
Termination in connection with the Separation.
Employment is due to the Separation, your unvested Stock Options subject to this Award will accelerate and vest pro rata
based on the number of full months of service completed commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the date of your Termination of Employment divided by the number of full months required to achieve complete vesting (with an offset for Stock Options previously vested).  Your Stock Option will expire one year after the date of your Termination of Employment
or such later date as may be applicable under Section 7
.
 
Further, if you qualify for accelerated vesting under this Section 10(a), the requirement set forth in Section 10(b)(i) shall not apply.
 
(b) Termination of Employment - Executives. 
If (i) your Termination of Employment occurs twelve months or later after the Grant Date, (ii) upon your Termination of Employment you are a Section 16 Officer or employed in a job classification Band 1 or Band 2, and (iii) you are involuntarily terminated for reasons other than Cause, a portion of your Award equivalent to the number of Stock Options that would have vested in the twelve month period following the date of your Termination of Employment had you not been terminated will accelerate and immediately vest.  The vested portion of your Award will expire on the earlier of (i) the original expiration date of the Award, (ii) one year after the date of your Termination of Employment and (iii) such later date as may be applicable under Section 7.
 
11.
                                
Withholdings; Tax Recovery.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may transfer the Stock Option to members of your immediate family or to one or more trusts for the benefit of family members or to one or more partnerships in which the family members are the only partners, provided that (i) you do not receive any consideration for the transfer, (ii) you furnish the Committee or its designee with detailed written notice of the transfer at least three (3) business days in advance, and (iii) the Committee or its designee consents in writing.  For this purpose, "family member" means your spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, nieces, nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews, including adopted, in-laws and step family members. Any Stock Option transferred pursuant to this provision will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to the Stock Option immediately prior to transfer.  The Stock Option may be exercised by the transferee only to the same extent that you could have exercised the Stock Option had no transfer occurred.

Furthermore, by not declining this Award you agree and promise immediately to deliver to the Company Shares (or, in the
discretion of the Committee, cash) equal in value to the amount of any profit you realized upon an exercise of the Stock Option during the period beginning six months prior to your Termination of Employment for Cause and ending on the six-month anniversary of your Termination of Employment for Cause, including, without limitation, a termination for Cause resulting from your violation of the Company's Code of Ethical Conduct.
 
(b)
                                
If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that at any time after the Grant Date and prior to the second anniversary of your Termination of Employment you (i) disclosed business confidential or proprietary information related to any business of the Company or Subsidiary or (ii) have entered into an employment or consultation arrangement (including any arrangement for employment or service as an agent, partner, stockholder, consultant, officer or director) with any entity or person engaged in a business, which arrangement would likely (in the sole judgment of the Committee) result in the disclosure of business confidential or proprietary information related to any business of the Company or a Subsidiary to a business that is competitive with any Company or Subsidiary business as to which you have had access to business strategic or confidential information, and the Committee has not approved the arrangement in writing, then any Stock Option that you have not exercised (whether vested or unvested) will immediately be rescinded, and you will forfeit any rights you have with respect to these Stock Options as of the date of the Committee's determination.

Any such determinations and adjustments made by the Committee will be binding on all persons.
 
15.
                                
Restrictions on Exercise.
  Exercise of the Stock Option is subject to the conditions that, to the extent required at the time of exercise, (a) the Shares covered by the Stock Option will be duly listed, upon official notice of issuance, on the NYSE, and (b) a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the Shares will be effective or an exemption from registration will apply.

Stock Option to the extent that the Company has a right of recovery or reimbursement under applicable securities laws or under its pay recoupment policy.
