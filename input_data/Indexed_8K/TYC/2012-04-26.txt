($ millions, except per-share amounts)
 
SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland  April 26, 2012  Tyco International Ltd.
(NYSE: TYC) today reported $0.71 in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the fiscal second quarter of 2012 and diluted EPS from continuing operations before special items of $0.86 per
 
 
share. Revenue in the quarter of $4.4 billion increased 9% versus the prior year and organic revenue grew 7%.
 
Tyco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen said, "We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth this quarter driven by encouraging order trends across our businesses including some of our late-cycle businesses. We expect these trends to continue in the second half of the year resulting in further improvement in our operating performance."
 
"We are making good progress on our separation activities including the filing earlier this month of our Form 10 Registration Statement for ADT and we expect to announce the filings for both Flow Control and Fire & Security within the next week. With these steps, we remain on track to complete the proposed transactions including the merger of the flow control business with Pentair, Inc. at the end of September," Breen added.
 
Organic revenue, free cash flow and operating income, operating margin, income and diluted EPS from continuing operations before special items are non-GAAP financial measures and are described below. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, see the attached tables. Additional schedules as well as Second Quarter Review slides can be found at www.tyco.com on the Investor Relations portion of Tyco's website.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
The financial results presented in the tables below are in accordance with GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Effective in the second fiscal quarter of 2012, the company reorganized its management and reporting structure in anticipation of the spin-offs of the ADT North America Residential and Flow Control businesses. Under the new reporting structure, the former Tyco Security Solutions segment has been split between the new ADT North America Residential segment (referred to herein as "ADT") and the new Fire & Security segment. The new ADT segment consists of residential and small business security in North America. The new Fire & Security segment consists of i) the former Fire Protection segment and ii) the North American commercial security business, all of the security businesses outside North America, and the security products business, all of which were part of the former Tyco Security Solutions segment. The Flow Control segment continues as previously constituted. Additionally, the company classified its Fire Equipment de Mexico, S.A. business as a discontinued operation in connection with Tyco's sale of the business, which was completed during the second quarter of 2012. The revenue and operating income results shown below have been adjusted to reflect
 
 
these changes. All dollar amounts are pre-tax and stated in millions. All comparisons are to the fiscal second quarter of 2011 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Fire & Security
 
 
Revenue of $2.6 billion increased 5% in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 3.5%. Organic revenue growth of 14% in fire and security products and 3% in service was partially offset by a 1% organic revenue decline in systems installation due to softness in the non-residential construction market. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, orders increased 9.5% year-over-year and backlog increased 5% to $4.7 billion on a quarter sequential basis.
 
Operating income was $286 million and the operating margin was 11.2%. Special items of $23 million consisted primarily of restructuring charges. Operating income before special items was $309 million and the operating margin was 12.1%. The 70 basis point operating margin improvement before special items was driven by increased volume in products, continued growth of service revenue as well as the benefit of cost-containment and restructuring actions.
 
ADT
 
 
Revenue of $807 million increased 5% in the quarter both on a GAAP and organic basis. Revenue growth was driven by 3.5% growth in average revenue per user (ARPU) and 2% growth in customer accounts. The 13.2% attrition rate for the quarter remained flat year over year while increasing 20 basis points sequentially.
 
Operating income was $194 million and the operating margin was 24.0%. Special items of $5 million consisted of Broadview integration costs. Operating income before special items was $199 million and the operating margin was 24.7%. Operating income increased due to revenue improvement primarily from ADT's higher margin recurring revenue business, partially offset by a year over year increase in sales and marketing investments.
 
Flow Control
 
 
Revenue of $996 million increased 24% in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 21%. Organic revenue grew 18% in Valves, 21% in Water and 32% in Thermal Controls. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, orders increased 21% year-over-year and backlog increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis to $1.9 billion.
 
Operating income was $111 million and the operating margin was 11.1%. Operating income before special items was $114 million and the operating margin was 11.4%. Operating income before special items was negatively impacted by mix in Thermal Controls related to lower sales of higher margin products due to an unseasonably warm winter in North America. Additionally, operating income included a $4 million charge associated with a water project retained from a prior divestiture. The company estimates that these two items had a total impact of $10 million or about 100 basis points on operating income before special items.
 
OTHER ITEMS
 
                 
The company completed the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Cash from operating activities in the quarter was $716 million and free cash flow was $326 million, which included a cash outflow of $76 million primarily related to separation and restructuring activities. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $402 million. On a year to date basis, adjusted free cash flow of $415 million increased 21% over the prior year.
                 
Corporate expense before special items was $75 million.
 
 
                 
The company incurred pre-tax special charges of $63 million in the quarter related to separation and restructuring activities which was partially offset by $30 million of net benefit related to legacy legal matters.
                 
The tax rate before special items was 17.2%.
                 
As previously disclosed, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million during the month of January.
                 
On March 28, 2012, Tyco announced a definitive agreement to combine its Flow Control business with Pentair, Inc. in a tax-free, all-stock merger. The transaction is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust in which Tyco will complete the spin-off of its Flow Control business to its shareholders immediately followed by the merger of Pentair and Tyco Flow Control. Upon closing, Tyco shareholders will own 52.5% of the combined company.
                 
On April 10, 2012, The ADT Corporation filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A copy of the Form 10 is available at www.sec.gov under "ADT Corp"; a copy is also available at www.tyco.com. Within the next week, Tyco intends to file documents related to the spin-off and merger of Flow Control, including a proxy statement related to the shareholder vote on the spin-offs of ADT and Flow Control.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
 
Organic revenue, free cash flow (outflow) (FCF), and income from continuing operations, earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations, operating income, operating margin and corporate expense, in each case "before special items," are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.
 
Organic revenue is a useful measure used by the company to measure the underlying results and trends in the business. The difference between reported net revenue (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic revenue (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and other changes that do not reflect the underlying results and trends (for example, revenue reclassifications). The Company's organic growth / decline calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported revenue associated with any acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year, and exclude prior year revenues associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year. The rate of organic growth or decline is calculated based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth or decline of the combined business, in the case of acquisitions, or the remaining business, in the case of dispositions. The rate of organic growth or decline for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year are based on unadjusted historical revenue. Organic revenue and the rate of organic growth or decline as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
Organic revenue is a useful measure of the company's performance because it excludes items that: i) are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of foreign currency exchange; or ii) do not reflect the underlying results of the company's businesses, such as acquisitions and divestitures. It may be used as a component of the company's compensation programs. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company's revenue. This limitation is best addressed by using organic revenue in combination with the GAAP numbers. See the accompanying tables to this press release for the reconciliation presenting the components of organic revenue.
 
FCF is a useful measure of the company's cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. The difference between Cash Flows from Operating Activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash flows that the company believes are useful to identify. FCF permits management and investors to gain insight into the number that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. It, or a measure that is based on it, may be used as a component in the company's incentive compensation plans. The difference reflects the impact from:
 
                 
net capital expenditures,
                 
dealer generated accounts and bulk accounts purchased by ADT,
                 
cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities,
 
 
                 
voluntary pension contributions, and
                 
the sale of accounts receivable programs.
 
Capital expenditures and dealer generated and bulk accounts purchased by ADT are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities is subtracted because these cash outflows are not available for general corporate uses. Voluntary pension contributions and the impact from the sale of accounts receivable programs are added or subtracted because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. In addition, from time to time the company may present adjusted free cash flow, which is free cash flow, adjusted to exclude the cash impact of the special items highlighted below. This number provides information to investors regarding the cash impact of certain items management believes are useful to identify, as described below.
 
The limitation associated with using FCF is that it adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure. This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.
 
FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to read the company's financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the accompanying tables to this press release that show all the elements of the GAAP measures of Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Cash Flows from Investing Activities, Cash Flows from Financing Activities and a reconciliation of the company's total cash and cash equivalents for the period. See the accompanying tables to this press release for a cash flow statement presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation presenting the components of FCF and adjusted FCF.
 
The company has presented its income and EPS from continuing operations, operating income and margin, and its corporate expense before special items. Special items include charges and gains related to divestitures, acquisitions, restructurings, impairments, certain changes to accounting mehtodologies, legacy legal and tax charges and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends of the company or business segment, as applicable. The company utilizes these measures to assess overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance, as well as to provide insight to management in evaluating overall and segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. The Company also presents its effective tax rate as adjusted for special items for consistency. One or more of these measures may be used as components in the company's incentive compensation plans. These measures are useful for investors because they may permit more meaningful comparisons of the company's underlying operating results and business trends between periods. The difference between income and EPS from continuing operations before special items and income and EPS from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure. Operating income and margin before special items do not reflect any additional adjustments that are not reflected in income from continuing operations before special items. The limitation of these measures is that they exclude the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease the company's reported operating income and margin and operating income and EPS from continuing operations. This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measures in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or
 
 
decrease on reported results. Tyco provides general corporate services to its segments and those costs are reported in the "Corporate and Other" segment. This segment's operating income (loss) is presented as "Corporate Expense."
