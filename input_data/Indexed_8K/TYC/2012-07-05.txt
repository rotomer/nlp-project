Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Note Purchase Agreement
 
On June 27, 2012, Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The ADT Corporation ("ADT"), entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (as representatives of the several purchasers named therein, collectively, the "Initial Purchasers") under which ADT agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the "Notes").
 
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on July 5, 2012. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). ADT offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. ADT relied on these exemptions from registration based in part upon representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement. The net proceeds payable from the offering of the Notes, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts and commissions and other expenses, were approximately $2.47 billion and will be used to repay intercompany debt and to make other cash payments to Tyco to allow it to fund repurchases or redemptions of its indebtedness.
 
Indenture and Supplemental Indentures
 
The Notes are governed by an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of July 5, 2012, between ADT, as issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First through Third Supplemental Indentures, each dated as of July 5, 2012, among ADT, as issuer, Tyco, as guarantor, and the Trustee (together, the "Supplemental Indentures"). The Indenture and Supplemental Indentures, including the forms of Notes, are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 and are incorporated herein by reference. The descriptions of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures and the Notes in this report are summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures and the Notes, respectively.
 
The Notes are ADT's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior debt, and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that ADT may incur. Initially, the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Tyco. The guarantee will automatically and unconditionally be released and
 
cancelled upon Tyco's distribution (the "Distribution") to its shareholders of the shares of ADT's common stock.
 
The 2017 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.250% per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.500% per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. The 2042 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.875% per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for.
 
Interest on the Notes will be payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2013, to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 1 and July 1 prior to each interest payment date. In certain circumstances, ADT may be required to pay additional interest.
 
The Notes are redeemable solely at ADT's option at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the series of Notes and a make-whole price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ADT may also redeem all, but not less than all, of a series of Notes in the event of certain tax changes affecting such notes.
 
In addition, if the Distribution has not occurred on or prior to March 31, 2013 or if Tyco determines that the Distribution will not occur by March 31, 2013, ADT may elect to redeem each series of the Notes by issuing a redemption notice on or prior to June 30, 2013.  The redemption price applicable to such redemption will be 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Supplemental Indentures), unless ADT has exercised its right to redeem the Notes, each holder of Notes will have the right to require ADT to purchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
 
Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement
 
In connection with the sale of the Notes, Tyco and ADT entered into an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement (the "Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement") with the Initial Purchasers, dated as of July 5, 2012. Under the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, ADT and Tyco agree, at their cost, to (i) file with the SEC an exchange offer registration statement with respect to an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act to exchange the Notes of each series for an issue of another series of notes (the "Exchange Notes") that are identical in all material respects to the applicable series of Notes (except that the Exchange Notes will not contain transfer restrictions or any increase in annual interest rate) within 180 days after July 5, 2012, (ii) to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act within 365 days of July 5, 2012, (iii) to use their commercially reasonable efforts to commence the exchange offer promptly, but no later than 10 business days after the registration statement has
 
become effective, (iv) to hold the exchange offer open for not less than 20 business days and (v) to complete the exchange offer no later than 30 days after the commencement of the exchange offer.
 
If the exchange offer is not consummated, under certain circumstances and within specified time periods, ADT and Tyco are required to file a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Notes, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective and to keep the shelf registration statement effective until such time as the Notes cease to be registrable securities.
 
Subject to certain limitations, ADT will be required to pay the holders of the Notes special interest on the Notes if ADT fails to register the Notes or consummate the exchange offer within, or to keep such registration statement effective during, specified time periods or if ADT requires holders to refrain from disposing of their registrable securities for a period exceeding 45 days in any one instance or 90 days in the aggregate during any 12-month period.
 
A copy of the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.5 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement in this report is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement.

succeeding sentence, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Security.

Section 3.02
                               
Notice of Redemption
.
 
(a)
                                 
If the Company desires to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series, the Company shall, or shall instruct the Trustee in writing to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to the Trustee and such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register, unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed.  Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives the notice.  In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities of such series or any other series.  In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction.
 
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed and the CUSIP numbers of such series, and shall state that:  (i) payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, or, if none, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, upon presentation and surrender of such Securities; (ii) interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice; (iii) from and after said date interest will cease to accrue; and (iv) the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed. In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security,
 
a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
 
(b)
                                
The Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' written notice, unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee, in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to be redeemed.  If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee thereupon shall select from Securities of such series Outstanding not previously called for redemption, in accordance with a method that complies with applicable legal requirements, the rules and procedures of DTC, if applicable, and the requirements, if any, of the Depository and of any stock exchange on which Securities are listed and that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate, which may include selection pro rata or by lot, and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof of the principal amount of such Securities of such series of a denomination larger than $1,000, the Securities of such series to be redeemed.  The Trustee promptly shall notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities of such series to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
 
The Company, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of an Officer's Certificate, may instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Section 3.02, such notice to be in the name and at the expense of the Company or its own name, as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section 3.02.

If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, in each case as established pursuant to Section 2.01.  Interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof.  On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, such Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (but if the date fixed for redemption is an Interest Payment Date, the interest installment payable on such date shall be payable to the registered holder at the close of business on the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.01).
 
(b)
                                
Upon presentation of any Security of such series that is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute a new Security of the same series and tenor of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented,
 
and any Guarantor thereof, if applicable, shall execute the form of Guarantee thereon, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate, and the office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, such new Security; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute a new Global Security of like tenor in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered, and any Guarantor thereof, if applicable, shall execute the form of Guarantee thereon, and, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate requesting authentication and delivery, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for such Global Security, without service charge, such new Global Security.

Limitation on Suits

No holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof with respect to the Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default; (ii) the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee hereunder; (iii) such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity and security reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such written notice, request and offer of indemnity and security reasonably satisfactory to it, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and (v) during such 60 day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any other provisions of this Indenture, the right of any holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on such Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or, in the case of redemption, on the redemption date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder.  By accepting a Security hereunder it is expressly understood, intended and covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Securities of such series (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such holders). For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 6.04, each Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.

(b)

Subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article VI or by law to the Trustee or the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.

(b)

Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
(c)
                                 
At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the amount due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Company, any Guarantor thereof, if applicable, and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has or has caused to be paid or deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration, with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit, and (ii) any and all Events of Default under
 
this Indenture with respect to such series, except non-payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series as a result of such declaration, shall have been remedied or waived. No such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
(d)
                                
In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, any Guarantor thereof, if applicable, and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.

the Securities of that series or by an Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.  The Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section 8.04, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not an Affiliate. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee.  Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities of a particular series, if any known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above described Persons and, subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities of such particular series not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.

Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security.  Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series.

(ii) the Company or any Guarantor, as applicable, shall also pay or cause to be paid all other amounts payable hereunder by the Company with respect to such series,
 
then, subject to Section 11.03(c), after the date such funds or Governmental Obligations, as the case may be, are deposited with the Trustee, the obligations of the Company and any Guarantor, if applicable, under this Indenture with respect to such series shall cease to be of further effect except, to the extent applicable to each, for the provisions of Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.07, 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 7.05 and 7.10 hereof that shall survive until such Securities shall mature and be paid.

(b)
          
In addition, each of the Company and any Guarantor, as applicable, at its option and at any time, by written notice executed by an Officer delivered to the Trustee, may elect to have its obligations, to the extent applicable to each, under Section 5.03 and any covenant contained in Article X, and any other covenant contained in the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture relating to such series pursuant to Section 2.01, discharged with respect to all Outstanding Securities of a series, this Indenture and any indentures supplemental to this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (""), such discharge to be effective on the date the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 11.03(c) are satisfied, and such Securities shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration of Securityholders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be "Outstanding" for all other purposes under this Indenture.  For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with
covenant defeasance

(c)

(iii)
no Event of Default under clauses (1), (2), (3), (5), (6) or (7) of Section 6.01(a) shall have occurred and be continuing, and no event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become such an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, on the date of such deposit;
 
(iv)
the Company or Guarantor, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel or a ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the holders of the Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Company's or Guarantor's exercise of either option under this Section 11.03 and will be subject to Federal income tax in the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such election had not been exercised;
(v)
such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not (i) cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to any Securities or (ii) result in the trust arising from such deposit to constitute, unless it is registered as such, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and
 
(vi)
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 11.03, such covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Company or Guarantor pursuant to Section 2.01.

Section 14.01
        
Guarantee
.
 
Unless otherwise specified in the terms of a Guarantee of a series of Securities under this Indenture, each person named as a Guarantor of a series of Securities under this Indenture, by being named as a Guarantor of such series of Securities, fully and unconditionally guarantees (i) (A) to each Holder of each Security that is authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and (B)  to the Trustee on behalf of such Holder, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Security when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise and (ii) to the Trustee on its behalf all amounts owed to the Trustee under the Indenture, in each case in accordance with the terms of such Security and of this Indenture.  In case of the failure of the Company punctually to make any such payment, each such Guarantor agrees to cause such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the stated maturity or by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Company.
 
Each Guarantor, by being named as a Guarantor of any series of Securities under this Indenture, agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, the validity, regularity or enforceability of such Security or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same or any release, amendment, waiver or indulgence granted to the Company or any such Guarantor or any consent to departure from any requirement of any other guarantee of all or any of the Securities or any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor.  Each such Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, any requirement that the Trustee or any of the Holders protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest in or other lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Company or any other Person or any collateral, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged in respect of such Security except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Security and in such Guarantee.  Each such Guarantor agrees that if, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee or any of the Holders of the applicable series of Securities are prevented by applicable law from exercising their respective rights to accelerate the maturity of such Securities, to collect interest on such Securities, or to enforce or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to such Securities,
such Guarantor agrees to the Trustee for the account of such Holders, upon demand therefor, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had such rights and remedies been permitted to be exercised by the Trustee or any of such Holders.
Any such Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the holders of the Securities against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by such Guarantor on account of such Security pursuant to the provisions of its Guarantee or this Indenture; provided, however, that such Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payment arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of and interest on all Securities of such series issued hereunder shall have been paid in full.
 
Each Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of such Securities, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any holder of such Securities, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made.  In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, such Securities shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
 
Any term or provision of a Guarantee to the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate amount of the obligations guaranteed hereunder shall be reduced to the extent necessary to prevent such Guarantee from violating or becoming voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
 
Section 14.02
        
Execution and Delivery of Guarantees
.
 
Unless otherwise specified in the terms of a Guarantee of a series of Securities under this Indenture, each Guarantee shall include the terms of the Guarantee set forth in Section 14.01 and shall be substantially in the form established pursuant to Section 2.16.  Each Guarantor of any such series hereby agrees to execute its Guarantee, in a form established pursuant to Section 2.16, on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
 
Each such Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of each such Guarantor by any one of its chairman of the Board of Directors, president, vice presidents or other person duly authorized by the Board of Directors of such Guarantor.  The signature of any or all of these persons on a Guarantee may be manual or facsimile.
 
A Guarantee bearing the manual or facsimile signature of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of such Guarantor shall bind such Guarantor, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of any Security or did not hold such offices at the date of such Guarantee.
The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantee on behalf of a Guarantor and shall bind such Guarantor notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantee does not bear the signature of such Guarantor.  Every Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 14.01 and in the form of Guarantee established pursuant to Section 2.16 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to execute a Guarantee on any such Security.
 
Section 14.03
        
Release of Guarantee
.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Article XIV to the contrary, concurrently with the payment in full of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Securities of a series, every Guarantor shall be released from and relieved of its obligations under this Article XIV with respect to the Securities of such series.  Upon the delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the transaction giving rise to the release of this Guarantee was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the Securities, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of each Guarantor from its obligations under this Guarantee.  If any of the obligations to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities and all other obligations of the Company are revived and reinstated after the termination of this Guarantee, then all of the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be revived and reinstated as if this Guarantee had not been terminated until such time as the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities are paid in full, and each Guarantor shall enter into an amendment to this Guarantee, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, evidencing such revival and reinstatement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed all as of the day and year first above written.

The Offered Securities may be redeemed, as a whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, upon not less than 30 nor more than 90 days notice (which notice shall be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date and Additional Amounts (as defined in Section 3.2), if any, if as a result of any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of Switzerland or the United States, as applicable, or any political subdivision thereof or therein having the power to tax (a ""), or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws, including any action taken by a taxing authority or a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction (regardless of whether such action or such holding is with respect to the Company or Guarantor), which amendment or change is announced or becomes effective after the date the Offered Securities are issued, the Guarantor or the Company has become, or there is a material probability that it will become, obligated to pay Additional Amounts on the next date on which any amount would be payable with respect to the Securities of such series, and such obligation cannot be avoided by the use of commercially reasonable measures available to Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be; provided, however, that (a) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be, would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts, and (b) at the time such notice of redemption is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Taxing Jurisdiction
 
Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by Guarantor taking commercially reasonable measures available to it, and (ii) a written opinion of independent legal counsel to the Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be, of recognized standing to the effect that the Company has or there is a material probability that it will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a change, amendment, official interpretation or application described above and that the Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be, cannot avoid the payment of such Additional Amounts by taking commercially reasonable measures available to it.
Section 2.02.
                            
Payment of Additional Amounts

In the event that Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the Guarantees, the Guarantor will pay such additional amounts ("") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder of Securities (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment to a holder of the Offered Securities or a holder of a beneficial interests in the Offered Securities where such holder is subject to taxation on such payment by a relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for any reason other than such holder's mere ownership of the Offered Securities or for or on account of:
Taxes
Additional Amounts
 
(a)
                                 
any Taxes that are imposed or withheld solely because such holder or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, or member of such holder if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:
 
(i)
                                    
is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or business in the Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment in the Taxing Jurisdiction;
 
(ii)

(iii)
                              
with respect to any withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, is or was with respect to the United States a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax exempt organization or corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; or
 
(iv)
                             
owns or owned 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or the Guarantor;
 
(b)
                                
any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise or personal property Taxes imposed with respect to the Securities, except as otherwise provided herein;
 
(c)
                                 
any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the presentation of such Securities (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder thereof would have been entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had the Securities been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;
 
(d)
                                
any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the failure of such holder or any other person to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction of such holder, if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes;
 
(e)
                                 
with respect to withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, any such Taxes imposed by reason of the failure of such holder to fulfill the statement requirements of sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code;
 
(f)
                                   
any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by the Guarantor or the Company or any paying agent from payments in respect of such Securities;
 
(g)
                                
any Taxes required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of any Securities if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
 
(h)
                                
any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, or any amendment thereof, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, that Directive or the Luxembourg Law of December 23, 2005, as amended;
 
(i)
                                    
any withholding or deduction for Taxes which would not have been imposed if the relevant Securities had been presented to another paying agent in a Member State of the European Union; or
 
(j)
                                    
any combination of Section 3.02(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i).
 
Additional Amounts will not be payable to or for the account of any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security if such payment would not be subject to such withholding or deduction of Taxes but for the failure of a Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar
 
claim for exemption or to provide a certificate declaring its non-residence, if the Company were treated as a domestic corporation under United States federal income tax and if (x) the making of such declaration or claim or the provision of such certificate is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant Taxing Authority as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes, and (y) at least 90 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Guarantor shall apply this paragraph, the Guarantor shall have notified all Holders of Offered Securities in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim.
Additional Amounts also will not be payable to any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or to such holder that is not the sole Holder or holder of such beneficial interests of such Offered Security, as the case may be.  This exception, however, will apply only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment.
 
In addition, no Additional Amounts will be paid on account of any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable) and any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof.
 
The Guarantor will also (i) make such withholding or deduction of Taxes and (ii) remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with all applicable laws.  The Guarantor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Taxing Authority imposing such Taxes.  The Guarantor will, upon request, make available to the holders of the Offered Securities, within 90 days after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Guarantor or if, notwithstanding Guarantor's efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence of such payments by Guarantor.
 
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Guarantees is due and payable, if the Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information as is necessary to enable such Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of Offered Securities on the payment date.
 
The provisions of this Article II shall survive any termination of the discharge of this Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which the Guarantor or any successor Person to the Guarantor is organized or is engaged in business for tax purposes or any political subdivisions or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein; provided, however, the date on which the Guarantor changes its jurisdiction in which it is organized or such Person
 
becomes a successor to the Guarantor shall be substituted for the date on which the Offered Securities was issued.
Whenever in this Indenture, the Securities or the Guarantees there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal and premium, if any, redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Security, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

Taxing Jurisdiction
Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by Guarantor taking commercially reasonable measures available to it, and (ii) a written opinion of independent legal counsel to the Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be, of recognized standing to the effect that the Company has or there is a material probability that it will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a change, amendment, official interpretation or application described above and that the Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be, cannot avoid the payment of such Additional Amounts by taking commercially reasonable measures available to it.
 
Section 2.02.
                            
Payment of Additional Amounts

In the event that Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the Guarantees, the Guarantor will pay such additional amounts ("") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder of Securities (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment to a holder of the Offered Securities or a holder of a beneficial interests in the Offered Securities where such holder is subject to taxation on such payment by a relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for any reason other than such holder's mere ownership of the Offered Securities or for or on account of:
Taxes
Additional Amounts
 
(a)
                                 
any Taxes that are imposed or withheld solely because such holder or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, or member of such holder if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:
 
(i)
                                    
is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or business in the Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment in the Taxing Jurisdiction;
 
(ii)
                                 
has or had any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of ownership of such Securities) with the Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, including being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being treated as being or having been a resident thereof;
 
(iii)
                              
with respect to any withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, is or was with respect to the United States a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax exempt organization or corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; or
(iv)
                             
owns or owned 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or the Guarantor;
 
(b)
                                
any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise or personal property Taxes imposed with respect to the Securities, except as otherwise provided herein;
 
(c)
                                 
any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the presentation of such Securities (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder thereof would have been entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had the Securities been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;
 
(d)
                                
any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the failure of such holder or any other person to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction of such holder, if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes;
 
(e)
                                 
with respect to withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, any such Taxes imposed by reason of the failure of such holder to fulfill the statement requirements of sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code;
 
(f)
                                   
any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by the Guarantor or the Company or any paying agent from payments in respect of such Securities;
 
(g)
                                
any Taxes required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of any Securities if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
 
(h)
                                
any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, or any amendment thereof, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, that Directive or the Luxembourg Law of December 23, 2005, as amended;
 
(i)
                                    
any withholding or deduction for Taxes which would not have been imposed if the relevant Securities had been presented to another paying agent in a Member State of the European Union; or
 
(j)
                                    
any combination of Section 3.02(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i).
 
Additional Amounts will not be payable to or for the account of any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security if such payment would not be subject to such withholding or deduction of Taxes but for the failure of a Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar
claim for exemption or to provide a certificate declaring its non-residence, if the Company were treated as a domestic corporation under United States federal income tax and if (x) the making of such declaration or claim or the provision of such certificate is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant Taxing Authority as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes, and (y) at least 90 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Guarantor shall apply this paragraph, the Guarantor shall have notified all Holders of Offered Securities in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim.
 
Additional Amounts also will not be payable to any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or to such holder that is not the sole Holder or holder of such beneficial interests of such Offered Security, as the case may be.  This exception, however, will apply only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment.
 
In addition, no Additional Amounts will be paid on account of any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable) and any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof.
 
The Guarantor will also (i) make such withholding or deduction of Taxes and (ii) remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with all applicable laws.  The Guarantor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Taxing Authority imposing such Taxes.  The Guarantor will, upon request, make available to the holders of the Offered Securities, within 90 days after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Guarantor or if, notwithstanding Guarantor's efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence of such payments by Guarantor.
 
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Guarantees is due and payable, if the Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information as is necessary to enable such Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of Offered Securities on the payment date.
 
The provisions of this Article II shall survive any termination of the discharge of this Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which the Guarantor or any successor Person to the Guarantor is organized or is engaged in business for tax purposes or any political subdivisions or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein; provided, however, the date on which the Guarantor changes its jurisdiction in which it is organized or such Person
becomes a successor to the Guarantor shall be substituted for the date on which the Offered Securities was issued.
 
Whenever in this Indenture, the Securities or the Guarantees there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal and premium, if any, redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Security, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes
.
 
The Offered Securities may be redeemed, as a whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, upon not less than 30 nor more than 90 days notice (which notice shall be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date and Additional Amounts (as defined in Section 3.2), if any, if as a result of any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of Switzerland or the United States, as applicable, or any political subdivision thereof or therein having the power to tax (a ""), or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws, including any action taken by a taxing authority or a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction (regardless of whether such action or such holding is with respect to the Company or Guarantor), which amendment or change is announced or becomes effective after the date the Offered Securities are issued, the Guarantor or the Company has become, or there is a material probability that it will become, obligated to pay Additional Amounts on the next date on which any amount would be payable with respect to the Securities of such series, and such obligation cannot be avoided by the use of commercially reasonable measures available to Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be; provided, however, that (a) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which Guarantor or the Company, as the case may be, would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts, and (b) at the time such notice of redemption is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Section 2.02.
                            
Payment of Additional Amounts
.
 
All payments made by the Guarantor under or with respect to the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Taxing Jurisdiction (""), unless the Guarantor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof.  In the event that Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the Guarantees, the Guarantor will pay such additional amounts ("") as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder of Securities (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to a payment to a holder of the Offered Securities or a holder of a beneficial interests in the Offered Securities where such holder is subject to taxation on such payment by a relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for any reason other than such holder's mere ownership of the Offered Securities or for or on account of:
Taxes
Additional Amounts
 
(a)
                                 
any Taxes that are imposed or withheld solely because such holder or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, or member of such holder if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:
 
(i)
                                    
is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or business in the Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment in the Taxing Jurisdiction;
 
(ii)
                                 
has or had any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of ownership of such Securities) with the Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, including being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being treated as being or having been a resident thereof;
 
(iii)
                              
with respect to any withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, is or was with respect to the United States a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign tax exempt organization or corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; or
(iv)
                             
owns or owned 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or the Guarantor;
 
(b)
                                
any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise or personal property Taxes imposed with respect to the Securities, except as otherwise provided herein;
 
(c)
                                 
any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the presentation of such Securities (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder thereof would have been entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had the Securities been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;
 
(d)
                                
any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the failure of such holder or any other person to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction of such holder, if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes;
 
(e)
                                 
with respect to withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, any such Taxes imposed by reason of the failure of such holder to fulfill the statement requirements of sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code;
 
(f)
                                   
any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by the Guarantor or the Company or any paying agent from payments in respect of such Securities;
 
(g)
                                
any Taxes required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of any Securities if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
 
(h)
                                
any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, or any amendment thereof, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, that Directive or the Luxembourg Law of December 23, 2005, as amended;
 
(i)
                                    
any withholding or deduction for Taxes which would not have been imposed if the relevant Securities had been presented to another paying agent in a Member State of the European Union; or
 
(j)
                                    
any combination of Section 3.02(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i).
 
Additional Amounts will not be payable to or for the account of any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security if such payment would not be subject to such withholding or deduction of Taxes but for the failure of a Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security to make a valid declaration of non-residence or other similar
claim for exemption or to provide a certificate declaring its non-residence, if the Company were treated as a domestic corporation under United States federal income tax and if (x) the making of such declaration or claim or the provision of such certificate is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation, ruling or administrative practice of the relevant Taxing Authority as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, the relevant Taxes, and (y) at least 90 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which the Guarantor shall apply this paragraph, the Guarantor shall have notified all Holders of Offered Securities in writing that they shall be required to provide such declaration or claim.
 
Additional Amounts also will not be payable to any Holder or the holder of a beneficial interest in an Offered Security that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or to such holder that is not the sole Holder or holder of such beneficial interests of such Offered Security, as the case may be.  This exception, however, will apply only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member  received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment.
 
In addition, no Additional Amounts will be paid on account of any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable) and any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof.
 
The Guarantor will also (i) make such withholding or deduction of Taxes and (ii) remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with all applicable laws.  The Guarantor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Taxing Authority imposing such Taxes.  The Guarantor will, upon request, make available to the holders of the Offered Securities, within 90 days after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Guarantor or if, notwithstanding Guarantor's efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence of such payments by Guarantor.
 
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Guarantees is due and payable, if the Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information as is necessary to enable such Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of Offered Securities on the payment date.
 
The provisions of this Article II shall survive any termination of the discharge of this Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which the Guarantor or any successor Person to the Guarantor is organized or is engaged in business for tax purposes or any political subdivisions or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein; provided, however, the date on which the Guarantor changes its jurisdiction in which it is organized or such Person
becomes a successor to the Guarantor shall be substituted for the date on which the Offered Securities was issued.
 
Whenever in this Indenture, the Securities or the Guarantees there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal and premium, if any, redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Security, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Company will pay interest semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each such day, an "Interest Payment Date").

The principal of and the interest on the Securities shall be payable in the coin or currency of the

provided, however,
 
(b)           . The Company and the Guarantor may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b), that the Company and the Guarantor shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to them from each Electing Holder of Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor and all other Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, the Guarantor or such other Electing Holders may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus (including, without limitation, any "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433) contained therein or furnished by the Company and the Guarantor to any Electing Holder, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.
Indemnification by the Electing Holders
provided, however,
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action,
Notices of Claims, Etc. 
 
such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                                
Contribution. 
If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or
other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Electing Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.
 
(e)
                                 
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, each Electing Holder, and each person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and the Electing Holders contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder or Electing Holder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantor (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as well as to each officer and director of the other holders and to each person, if any, who controls such other holders within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
7.
                                     
Underwritten Offerings.
 
Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees with the Company and the Guarantor and each other such holder that no holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless (a) the Company and the Guarantor give their prior written consent to such underwritten offering, (b) the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Guarantor, (c) each holder of Registrable Securities participating in such underwritten offering agrees to sell such holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled selecting the managing underwriter or underwriters hereunder and (d) each holder of Registrable Securities participating in such underwritten offering completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. The Company and the Guarantor hereby agree with each holder of Registrable Securities that, to the
extent they consent to an underwritten offering hereunder, they will negotiate in good faith and execute all indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, including using all commercially reasonable efforts to procure customary legal opinions and auditor "comfort" letters.

Rule 144.
 
(a)
                                 
Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144.
The Company and the Guarantor covenant to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent they shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company and the Guarantor shall timely file the reports required to be filed by them under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144), and shall take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company and the Guarantor shall deliver to such holder written statements as to whether they have complied with such requirements.
 
(b)
                                
Availability of Rule 144 Not Excuse for Obligations Under Section 2.
  The fact that holders of Registrable Securities may become eligible to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 shall not (1) cause such Securities to cease to be Registrable Securities or (2) excuse the Company's and the Guarantor's obligations set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement, including without limitation the obligations in respect of an Exchange Offer, Shelf Registration and Special Interest.
