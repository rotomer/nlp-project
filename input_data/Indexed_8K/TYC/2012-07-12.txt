Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland
  Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco") (NYSE:TYC) today announced the reference yield and the total consideration for each series of notes subject to the previously announced tender offers of Tyco and its subsidiary, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), to purchase for cash the respective debt securities issued by TIFSA and/or Tyco, as the case may be, listed in the table below, in an aggregate principal amount of up to US$2,600,000,000.
July 11, 2012
 
The tender offers consist of two separate offers (each an "Offer", and collectively, the "Offers") on the terms set forth in an offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal, each dated June 27, 2012, with (i) an Offer to purchase any and all of specified series of outstanding debt securities (the "Any and All Offer") and (ii) a second Offer to purchase up to the Maximum Tender Amount (as defined below) of specified series of outstanding debt securities (the "Maximum Tender Offer").
 
The total consideration per US$1,000 principal amount of notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers was determined in the manner described in the tender offer documents by reference to a fixed spread specified for the series over the yield based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security specified in the table below. Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but excluding, the date of payment of the applicable consideration for such notes accepted for purchase in the Any and All Offer or the Maximum Tender Offer, as applicable.
 
 
(1)
         
Tyco is a co-issuer with TIFSA with respect to the 6.000% Notes due 2013, the 7.000% Notes due 2019 and the 6.875% Notes due 2021. Tyco guarantees all the notes listed in the table above except for those notes on which it is co-issuer.
 
The Any and All Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) today, July 11, 2012. Holders subject to the Any and All Offer must validly tender and not validly withdraw their notes before 5:00 p.m. EDT today, July 11, 2012 to be eligible to receive the total consideration.
 
The Maximum Tender Offer is subject to an aggregate purchase limit of US$1,443,903,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes less the aggregate principal amount of notes purchased in the Any and All Offer for the 7.000% Notes due 2019 and in the Any and All Offer for the 8.500% Notes due 2019 (the "Maximum Tender Amount"). The Maximum Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT on July 25, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the "Maximum Tender Offer Expiration Date"). Holders subject to the Maximum Tender Offer must validly tender and not validly withdraw their notes before 5:00 p.m. EDT today, July 11, 2012 (such time and date, the "Early Tender Date") to be eligible to receive the total consideration, which includes an early tender premium of US$30 per US$1,000 principal amount of notes accepted for purchase (the "Early Tender Premium").
 
Holders subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who validly tender their notes after the Early Tender Date and before the Maximum Tender Offer Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive an amount equal to the total consideration minus the Early Tender Premium.
 
The Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, including, among other things, the consummation of an issuance by The ADT Corporation, Tyco's wholly-owned subsidiary, of one or more series of notes with terms and conditions and in amount, in each case, satisfactory to Tyco. That condition has now been satisfied.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland
  Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco") (NYSE:TYC) today announcedthat, pursuant to the previously announced tender offers of Tyco and its subsidiary, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), to purchase for cash the respective debt securities issued by TIFSA and/or Tyco, as the case may be, US$1,249,071,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes subject to the Any and All Offer (as defined below) were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Any and All Offer at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on July 11, 2012 (such time and date, "the Any and All Offer Expiration Date"), and US$907,583,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer (as defined below) were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the early tender date of 5:00 p.m. EDT on July 11, 2012 (such time and date, the "Early Tender Date"), according to the information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the tender agent for such offers, as more fully set forth below.
July 12, 2012
 
The tender offers consist of two separate offers (each an "Offer", and collectively, the "Offers") on the terms set forth in an offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal, each dated June 27, 2012, with (i) an Offer to purchase any and all of specified series of outstanding debt securities (the "Any and All Offer") and (ii) a second Offer to purchase up to the Maximum Tender Amount (as defined below) of specified series of outstanding debt securities (the "Maximum Tender Offer").
 
 
(1)
         
Tyco is a co-issuer with TIFSA with respect to the 6.000% Notes due 2013, the 7.000% Notes due 2019 and the 6.875% Notes due 2021. Tyco guarantees all the notes listed in the table above except for those notes on which it is co-issuer.
(2)
         
Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase in priority to other notes tendered after the Early Tender Date even if such notes tendered after the Early Tender Date have a higher acceptance priority level than notes tendered prior to the Early Tender Date.
 
All notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Any and All Offer prior to the Any and All Offer Expiration Date have been accepted for purchase. Tyco and TIFSA expect to make payment for the applicable notes in same-day funds today, July 12, 2012. Tyco and TIFSA also intend to redeem, on or around August 15, 2012, all 6.000% Notes due 2013 and 4.125% Notes due 2014 that were not tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Any and All Offer and are outstanding as of the date of redemption.
 
The maximum principal amount of notes to be purchased pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer has been set as US$878,271,000 (the "Maximum Tender Amount"). Such maximum amount is equal to the difference between US$1,443,903,000 and the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Any and All Offer for the 7.000% Notes due 2019 and in the Any and All Offer for the 8.500% Notes due 2019.
 
As the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Date was greater than the Maximum Tender Amount, such tendered notes will be accepted for purchase up to the Maximum Tender Amount in accordance with the acceptance priority levels set forth in the table above, subject to proration in accordance with the terms set forth in the offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal. Tyco and TIFSA expect to make payment for the applicable notes in same-day funds today, July 12, 2012.
 
Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw their notes before the Early Tender Date will receive the total consideration, which includes an early tender premium of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered by such holders that are accepted for purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of settlement.
 
The Maximum Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT on July 25, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the "Maximum Tender Offer Expiration Date"). We will not accept for purchase any notes tendered after the Early Tender Date and before the Maximum Tender Offer Expiration Date.
 
The terms and conditions of the Maximum Tender Offer are set forth in the offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal, each dated June 27, 2012.
