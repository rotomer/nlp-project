On July 12, 2012, upon the recommendation of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Compensation Committee") and in connection with the proposed separation of the Company into three independent publicly-traded companies (the "Separation"), the Board of Directors of Tyco International, Ltd. (the "Company") approved the conversion of all outstanding performance share units of the Company into restricted stock units based on performance achieved through the end of the Company's third fiscal quarter (June 29, 2012). The restricted stock units that result from the conversion of such performance share units will be subject to the same vesting provisions that applied to the performance share awards prior to conversion (generally, three-year cliff vesting from date of grant). Each performance share unit will convert into a number of restricted stock units at a ratio to be determined by the Compensation Committee based on its review and certification of performance results in August 2012. Upon vesting of the resulting restricted stock units, each award will be settled in stock.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
