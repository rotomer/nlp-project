Non-GAAP Measures Organic revenue, free cash flow (outflow) (FCF), and income from continuing operations, earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations, operating income, operating margin and corporate expense, in each case "before special items," are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Organic revenue is a useful measure used by the company to measure the underlying results and trends in the business. The difference between reported net revenue (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic revenue (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and other changes that do not reflect the underlying results and trends (for example, revenue reclassifications). The Company's organic growth / decline calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported revenue associated with any acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year, and exclude prior year revenues associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year. The rate of organic growth or decline is calculated based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth or decline of the combined business, in the case of acquisitions, or the remaining business, in the case of dispositions. The rate of organic growth or decline for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year are based on unadjusted historical revenue. Organic revenue and the rate of organic growth or decline as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic revenue is a useful measure of the company's performance because it excludes items that: i) are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of foreign currency exchange; or ii) do not reflect the underlying results of the company's businesses, such as acquisitions and divestitures. It may be used as a component of the company's compensation programs. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company's revenue. This limitation is best addressed by using organic revenue in combination with the GAAP numbers. See the accompanying tables to this presentation for the reconciliation presenting the components of organic revenue. FCF is a useful measure of the company's cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. The difference between Cash Flows from Operating Activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash flows that the company believes are useful to identify. FCF permits management and investors to gain insight into the number that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. It, or a measure that is based on it, may be used as a component in the company's incentive compensation plans. The difference reflects the impact from:  -  net capital expenditures,  -  the acquisition of dealer generated accounts and bulk accounts,  -  cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities,  -  voluntary pension contributions, and  -  the sale of accounts receivable programs.
 
Non-GAAP Measures (Cont.) Capital expenditures and dealer generated and bulk account purchases are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities is subtracted because these cash outflows are not available for general corporate uses. Voluntary pension contributions and the impact from the sale of accounts receivable programs are added or subtracted because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. In addition, from time to time the company may present adjusted free cash flow, which is free cash flow adjusted to exclude the cash impact of the special items highlighted below. This number provides information to investors regarding the cash impact of certain items management believes are useful to identify, as described below. The limitation associated with using FCF is that it adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure. This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to read the company's financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the accompanying tables to this presentation that show all the elements of the GAAP measures of Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Cash Flows from Investing Activities, Cash Flows from Financing Activities and a reconciliation of the company's total cash and cash equivalents for the period. See the accompanying tables to this presentation for a cash flow statement presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation presenting the components of FCF and adjusted FCF. In this presentation, Tyco has presented its operating margin before special items for its Fire & Security business and future reportable segments. Special items include charges and gains related to divestitures, acquisitions, restructurings, impairments, certain changes to accounting methodologies, legacy legal and tax charges and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends of the company or business segment, as applicable. Tyco utilizes these measures to assess overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance, as well as to provide insight to management in evaluating overall and segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. Tyco also presents its effective tax rate and corporate expense as adjusted for special items for consistency. One or more of these measures may be used as components in the company's incentive compensation plans. These measures are useful for investors because they may permit more meaningful comparisons of Tyco's underlying operating results and business trends between periods. The difference between operating income and margin before special items and operating income and margin (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure. The limitation of these measures is that they exclude the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease the company's reported operating income and margin. This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measures in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results. Tyco provides general corporate services to its segments and those costs are reported in the "Corporate and Other" segment. This segment's operating income (loss) is presented as "Corporate Expense."

Some of the statements included herein constitute "forward-looking statements" regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the U.S. federal securities laws, neither we nor Tyco are under any obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise.
Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
Our actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of these factors, including:
competition in the markets we serve, including new entrants in these markets;
our ability to develop or acquire new technology;
failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks;
allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties;
unauthorized use of our brand name;
risks associated with Tyco's ownership of the ADT brand name outside of the United States and Canada;
failure to enforce our intellectual property rights;
our dependence on certain software technology that we license from third parties;
failure or interruption in products or services of third-party providers;
our greater exposure to liability for employee acts or omissions or system failures;
an increase in the rate of customer attrition;
downturns in the housing market and consumer discretionary income;
risks associated with our non-compete and non-solicit arrangements with Tyco;
entry of potential competitors upon the expiration of non-competition agreements;
shifts in consumers' choice of, or telecommunication providers' support for, telecommunication services and equipment;
interruption to our monitoring facilities;
interference with our customer's access to some of our products and services through the Internet by broadband service providers;
potential impairment of our deferred tax assets;
changes in U.S. and non-U.S. governmental laws and regulations; ??risks associated with acquiring and integrating customer accounts;
potential loss of authorized dealers and affinity marketing relationships;
failure to realize expected benefits from acquisitions;
risks associated with pursuing business opportunities that diverge from our current business model;
potential liabilities for obligations of The Brink's Company under the Coal Act;
capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources;
failure to fully realize expected benefits from the spin-off; and
difficulty in operating as an independent public company separate from Tyco.
Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. Consequently, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf, whether as a result of new information, future developments, subsequent events or circumstances or otherwise. The information contained herein should be considered in conjunction with our Form 10 and related exhibits originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2012 and most recently amended September 7, 2012 including the sections entitled "Risk Factors", "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere in the Form 1 0.

1 Corporate costs in the quarter expected to be $13M, about $4M below our expected run rate. This includes a combination of allocated Tyco corporate costs and ADT standalone public company costs. We expect our annual run rate for ADT standalone public company costs to be approximately $68M-$70M, or
~$17M quarterly, which is consistent with Tyco historical corporate allocation levels.
58
 
Significant Tax Assets Enable Low Cash Tax Rate
GAAP income tax rate will be in the 36%-38% range
ADT will have significant deferred tax assets which results in the cash tax rate being significantly below the P&L rate
ADT expects to have $1.0-$1.2 billion of federal tax loss carry forwards at the time of the separation1
In addition, ADT expects to have the ability to accelerate certain tax deductions that would allow us to minimize our cash tax rate for a period of time beyond the full utilization of the initial deferred tax assets
Expect cash taxes to be driven by Federal AMT, state taxes and
Canadian income and withholding taxes resulting in a cash tax rate ranging from 6-8%2
1 Per Form 10 proforma, expected $411 million deferred tax asset that included $1.024 million NOL carryforward at 6/29/12. Actual deferred tax asset balance will be determined and transferred at the time of spin and will include 4th quarter earnings/loss activity. Ultimately the actual NOL carryforward will be determined by the outcome of the pre-spin/Tyco IRS audits.
2 Actual cash tax rates will depend on level and mix of pre-tax earnings, the actual NOL carryforward and other tax credit utilization over the period.

1 Pro Forma dis-synergies represent anticipated costs as a result of the separation of our business from the commercial security business of Tyco.
Assumes a $40M midpoint of the disclosed annual range of $30M-$50M in our Form 10. However, this expense was not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data as it has not yet been fully incurred.
2 Operating income for Q3 FY2012 YTD as reported in the Form 10 included a $14M reduction in the Tyco corporate allocation which was only partially offset by an increase in ADT incremental public company costs for a net benefit of $10M year over year. We expect our annual run rate for ADT standalone public company costs to be approximately $68M-$70M, which is consistent with Tyco historical corporate allocation levels.
