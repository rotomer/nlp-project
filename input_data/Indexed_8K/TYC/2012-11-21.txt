On November 20, 2012, Tyco International Ltd. (the "Company") granted equity incentive awards to certain of the Company's officers, including George R. Oliver, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Arun Nayar, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Judith A. Reinsdorf, the Company's Executive Vice President and General Counsel. The awards were granted pursuant to the Company's 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and the terms and conditions filed as Exhibit 10.11 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on November 16, 2012, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
 
The equity incentive awards granted to Mr. Oliver consisted of (i) an annual equity award with a grant date value of $5,000,000 evenly split between performance share units and stock options and (ii) a leadership equity award with a grant date value of $2,500,000 evenly split between stock options and restricted stock units. In connection with the annual grant, Mr. Oliver received 341,100 stock options with an exercise price of $27.14, equal to the Company's closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange on November 20, 2012. These stock options vest in equal installments over four years. Mr. Oliver also received 92,100 performance share units, which cliff vest based on performance at the end of the three-year performance period. The number of shares that are ultimately delivered to Mr. Oliver in respect of these performance share units will depend on whether the Company achieves a three-year cumulative earnings per share target, with a modification of plus or minus 25% based on the Company's total shareholder return over the period relative to the S&P 500 Industrials Index. The maximum number of shares Mr. Oliver can receive is two times the number of units granted. In connection with the leadership grant, Mr. Oliver received 170,500 stock options with an exercise price of $27.14. These stock options cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. Mr. Oliver also received 46,000 restricted stock units as part of the leadership grant. Fifty percent of these restricted stock units vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, with the remainder vesting on the fourth anniversary. In the event of a termination event, the stock options, performance share units and restricted stock units described above may vest prior to the scheduled vesting date depending on the circumstances.
