(For Immediate Release)
MINNEAPOLIS (January 23, 2003)  UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) achieved record revenues and earnings in the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2002, reported Chairman and CEO William W. McGuire, M.D. today. Fourth quarter and full year results were driven by strong performance across the operating businesses that compose UnitedHealth Group .
 
Quarterly and Annual Financial Performance
On January 1, 2002, Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 142 became effective, eliminating strictly on a prospective basis the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Accordingly, results of periods reported prior to January 1, 2002 reflect amortization, and results subsequent to that date do not reflect amortization. The financial schedules accompanying this press release report the 2001 results as required by generally accepted accounting principles. To enhance analysis and comparability, a supplemental table provides comparably adjusted results at the reporting business segment level for all quarters of 2001. This adjustment added $93 million in operating income and $89 million in net income, or $0.28 in diluted net earnings per share, to 2001 full year results (7 cents per quarter) on a FAS No. 142 comparative basis. No other adjustments have been made. All ratios and computations described in this earnings report are on a FAS No. 142 comparative basis unless otherwise described.

"We are realizing the ongoing benefits of increasing operational advantages in services, systems, connectivity and health informatics that are driving market share gains and margin improvements.

"We project continued sequential quarterly earnings gains in 2003 and now expect full year earnings per share to grow around 22 percent above the record $4.25 per share earned last year."
