Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure" and Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
On October 16, 2003, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release discussing third quarter 2003 results. The press release is included as Exhibit 99 hereto. The press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company.
To supplement our consolidated financial results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the press release also discloses the following non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors:
Certain account balances and financial measures have been presented in this earnings release excluding our AARP business. Management believes these disclosures are meaningful since underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business are recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF) and the effects of changes in balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP program accrue to AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Although the Company is at risk for underwriting losses to the extent cumulative net losses exceed the balance in the RSF, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits to date and management believes the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract.

We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.

Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:

Closing Comment
"Our strong and consistent results notwithstanding, UnitedHealth Group businesses have not yet obtained optimum performance for either customers or shareholders. We will advance in this regard in 2004 through our focus on affordability, quality, clinical performance, service, innovation, technology deployment and overall customer value. We are excited by the prospects," said Dr. McGuire.
"Our outlook for next year includes strong revenue and earnings performance, driven by market share gains from each of our businesses and double-digit percentage operating margins. We now expect full-year 2003 earnings growth of 37 percent to $2.91 per share, and foresee growth in earnings per share in 2004 of 21 percent to 22 percent on this expanded earnings base."
