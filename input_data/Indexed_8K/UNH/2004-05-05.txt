Item 5. Other Events
     Consistent with its commitment to superior corporate governance practices, UnitedHealth Group indicated that Richard T. Burke, a member of the Board of Directors, has decided no longer to serve on the Audit Committee effective May 5, 2004 pending Institutional Shareholder Services' (ISS) review of its director independence standards in the Fall of 2004. In addition, UnitedHealth Group will end its engagement of the law firm Greenbaum Doll & McDonald PLLC, of which Mr. William C. Ballard, Jr., also a member of the Board of Directors, is Of Counsel, on or before June 30, 2004 and will not engage this law firm to perform further services for UnitedHealth Group while Mr. Ballard remains a director. These steps are being taken to conform with current ISS standards as to director independence. The ISS standards are in addition to the New York Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations with which the Company has always complied.
