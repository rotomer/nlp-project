On July 29, 2004, UnitedHealth Group acquired Oxford Health Plans, Inc. (Oxford). Under the terms of the agreement, Oxford shareholders received 0.6357 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $16.17 in cash for each share of Oxford common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $5.0 billion, comprised of approximately 52.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $3.4 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Group's share closing prices for two days before, the day of, and two days after the acquisition announcement date of April 26, 2004), approximately $1.3 billion in cash, and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of $240 million issued in exchange for Oxford's outstanding vested common stock options.
 
On February 10, 2004, UnitedHealth Group acquired Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc. (MAMSI). Under the terms of the agreement, MAMSI stockholders received 0.82 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $18 in cash for each share of MAMSI common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $2.7 billion, comprised of 36.4 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $1.9 billion based on the average of the closing prices of UnitedHealth Group common stock for two days before, the day of, and two days after the acquisition announcement date of October 27, 2003) and $800 million in cash. The results of operations and financial condition of MAMSI have been included in the UnitedHealth Group historical financial statements since the February 10, 2004 acquisition date.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI by UnitedHealth Group as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2003 for purposes of the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the acquisition of Oxford by UnitedHealth Group as if the acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2004 for purposes of the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2004.
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets of an acquired entity based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the transaction. A final determination of these fair values will include management's consideration of a valuation prepared by an independent valuation specialist. This valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired entity that exist as of the closing date of the transaction.
 
Because this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values, the actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the transaction may differ materially from the information presented in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. In addition to the independent valuation, the impact of any integration activities could cause material differences from the information presented below.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of UnitedHealth Group and Oxford. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of UnitedHealth Group that would have been reported had the transactions been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of UnitedHealth Group.
