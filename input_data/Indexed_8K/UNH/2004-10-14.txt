Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On October 14, 2004, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release discussing third quarter 2004 results. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference. The press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company.
     To supplement our consolidated financial results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the press release also discloses the following non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors:
     Certain account balances and financial measures have been presented in this earnings release excluding our AARP business. Management believes these disclosures are meaningful since underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business are recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF) and the effects of changes in balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP program accrue to AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Although the Company is at risk for underwriting losses to the extent cumulative net losses exceed the balance in the RSF, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits to date and management believes the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract.
     CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
     UnitedHealth Group and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), including statements in this report, in presentations, press releases (including the earnings release attached as Exhibit 99 to this report and the earnings conference call described in such earnings release) , filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors. Generally the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and unknown certainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.

EXHIBIT 99
N E W S R E L E A S E
(For Immediate Release)
MINNEAPOLIS (October 14, 2004)  UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) achieved record results in the third quarter of 2004, reported Chairman and CEO William W. McGuire, M.D. Third quarter results were driven by strong and diverse growth and consistent operating performance across the spectrum of UnitedHealth Group businesses, with every reporting segment producing year-over-year and sequential quarterly gains in earnings from operations and operating margins.

Closing Comment
"I am pleased to report these operating results, supported by strong cash flows. That said, our most significant accomplishments this quarter were in areas that strengthened our businesses for the future," Dr. McGuire stated. "Examples of these include closing the Oxford acquisition, establishing a strategic alliance with Harvard Pilgrim, formally launching our health savings account capabilities and strengthening our senior management group with several key new people. Operationally, we expect to close 2004 and enter 2005 with continued strong performance driven by a combination of increasing market share across all of our businesses and double-digit percentage overall operating margins. The impact of these gains is reflected in the fact that we now project fourth quarter 2004 earnings of approximately $1.07 per share, bringing our previous projection for full-year 2004 earnings up 5 cents to $3.92 per share. Building on that momentum, our outlook anticipates further earnings per share growth to approximately $4.70 to $4.75 per share in 2005, eight cents per share above the range of our most recent outlook."
