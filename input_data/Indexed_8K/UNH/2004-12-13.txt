Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
From time to time in the second half of December 2004 and the first half of January 2005, William W. McGuire, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the "Company"), Stephen J. Hemsley, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and other senior members of the Company's management team will be meeting with investors and analysts. Those discussions will focus on the Company's strategy, tactics and future outlook, and will include a reaffirmation of the Company's publicly disclosed 2004 and 2005 financial expectations. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 UnitedHealth Group and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), including statements in this report, in presentations, press releases, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors. Generally the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and unknown certainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include:  increases in medical costs that are higher than anticipated in establishing our premium rates, including increased use of or cost of medical services;  heightened competition as a result of new entrants into the market and consolidation of both our competitors and suppliers in the industries in which we operate, which may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, and to maintain or advance profitability;  events that may negatively affect our contract with AARP, including any failure on our part to service AARP customers in an effective manner and any adverse events that directly effect AARP or its business partners;  the uncertain effects on our business of the new Medicare reform legislation;  costs associated with legislative activity, government regulation and review of our industry, including costs of changes in our business practices in response to new legislation and regulations, costs associated with regular and special governmental audits, investigations and enforcement actions, and costs associated with maintaining necessary regulator y approvals;  a reduction in our bargaining power or a deterioration of our relationships with certain physicians, hospitals and other health care providers;  increases in costs associated with increased litigation and the potential that our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover certain costs;  failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, which could result in, among other things, loss of existing customers, difficulties in attracting new customers, difficulties in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, regulatory problems, and increases in operating expenses;  increases in costs associated with business acquisitions, including assumption of unanticipated liabilities, difficulties in integration, or underperformance of acquired companies;  costs associated with compliance with emerging restrictions on patient privac y, including system changes, development of new administrative processes, and compliance by our business associates;  failure to adequately maintain our proprietary rights to our databases and related products due to lack of legal protections or failure to take necessary precautions, which could hinder our ability to market and sell our products and services; and  the potential impact on the health care industry resulting from acts of terrorism or the threat of future acts of terrorism and related concerns, which could lead to, among other things, increased use of health care services, loss of membership in health plans due to reductions in employment, adverse effects on the financial condition of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees, disruption of our information and payment systems, increased health care costs and disruption of the financial and insurance markets. This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. A further lis t and description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
