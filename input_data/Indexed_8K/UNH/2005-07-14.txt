Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On July 14, 2005, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release discussing second quarter 2005 results. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99 and incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference. The press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company.
 
To supplement our consolidated financial results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the press release also discloses the following non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors:
 
Certain account balances and financial measures have been presented in this earnings release excluding our AARP business. Management believes these disclosures are meaningful since underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business are recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF) and the effects of changes in balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP program accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Although the Company is at risk for underwriting losses to the extent cumulative net losses exceed the balance in the RSF, the Company has not been required to fund any underwriting deficits to date and management believes the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract.
 
Adjusted operating cash flows is presented in the earnings release to facilitate the comparison of cash flows from operating activities for periods in which the Company does not receive all monthly premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS is contractually obligated to pay their monthly premium on the first calendar day of the applicable month. If the first calendar day of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, CMS pays the Company on the last business day of the preceding calendar month. As such, GAAP operating cash flows may vary depending upon the number of payments received by the Company from CMS during a particular period. Adjusted operating cash flows presents operating cash flows assuming that each monthly CMS premium payment was received on the first calendar day of the month.

MINNEAPOLIS (July 14, 2005)  UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) achieved record results in the second quarter of 2005, reported Chairman and CEO William W. McGuire, M.D. Results were notable for the consistent operating performance and strong and diverse growth across the spectrum of UnitedHealth Group businesses. Dr. McGuire stated, "We are particularly pleased with the continued growth of the various businesses within UnitedHealth Group. For example, this year we have extended services to approximately 1 million more people in the major medical benefits businesses alone. These significant gains suggest that our product approaches and affordability initiatives present meaningful value differentiation to customers. And while it is gratifying to report these developments today, they more importantly represent the basis for a very positive future for our company."

Closing Comment
 
"Our organizational intensity around disciplined business execution coupled with a relentless focus on the long-term imperatives of affordability, access, quality and usability  applied broadly within the heath care system  are reflected in our second quarter results," Dr. McGuire stated. "This combination of business execution and forward strategy to address the needs of our diverse client base is working well. We continue to build a foundation for sustained differentiated service and value to all participants in the health care markets.
 
"Based on our strong financial performance in the first half of this year, we now foresee earnings per share growth for full year 2005 of approximately 25 percent, with results projected in the range of $2.45 to $2.47 per share," concluded Dr. McGuire. "We are positioned to generate earnings of approximately $0.63 per share in the third quarter, a sizeable advance, particularly given the increase in Medicare Part D launch costs that we will absorb in earnings in the second half of 2005. We expect to continue to drive substantive gains in 2006, with earnings per share up at least 15 percent, excluding any contributions from the recently announced merger with PacifiCare, which will further strengthen our ability to meet customer needs in key geographies and end-market segments."
