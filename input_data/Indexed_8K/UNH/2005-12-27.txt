ITEMS 2.01 AND 2.03. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.. On December 20, 2005, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation ("UnitedHealth Group"), completed its acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PacifiCare"). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 6, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among UnitedHealth Group, Point Acquisition LLC ("Merger Sub") and PacifiCare, PacifiCare merged with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), as a result of which PacifiCare became a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of PacifiCare common stock (with certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) was converted into the right to receive (i) 1.1 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock, and (ii) $21.50 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"). Each outstanding share of restricted stock, deferred stock unit and restricted stock unit became fully vested and in full settlement thereof (net of applicable tax withholding in accordance with the practices of PacifiCare) was converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. All outstanding options to purchase PacifiCare common stock have been converted into options to purchase UnitedHealth Group common stock. The option exchange ratio is equal to 1.1 plus the fraction obtained by dividing $21.50 by the per share closing price of UnitedHealth Group common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the merger. The aggregate consideration paid to former PacifiCare shareholders consisted of approximately 99.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and approximately $1.9 billion in cash. In addition, in connection with the closing UnitedHealth Group retired approximately $600 million of debt under PacifiCare's credit facility and discharged and called for redemption under an irrevocable trust $325 million principal amount of PacifiCare's 10 3/4% Senior Notes due 2009. Approximately $101 million principal amount of PacifiCare's 3% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2032 (the "Convertible Notes") remain outstanding. Pursuant to the terms of a supplemental indenture dated December 20, 2005, the Convertible Notes are convertible in accordance with their terms into an aggregate of approximately 5.5 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and approximately $108 million in cash. UnitedHealth Group funded the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and the PacifiCare debt repayment through a combination of cash generated from operations and commercial paper issuances. The proxy statement/prospectus mailed to the security holders of PacifiCare, forming a part of UnitedHealth Group's Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration Number 333-127455) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, 2005, as amended on October 12, 2005, provides certain information about the Merger, UnitedHealth Group, Merger Sub and PacifiCare. 2
