On January 31, 2006, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the "Company") designated certain participants, including all executive officers of the Company, eligible to receive long term performance awards for the 2006-2008 performance period under the Companys ongoing Executive Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Incentive Plan, the Committee also approved target performance awards, maximum performance awards and objective performance goals for the 2005-2007 performance period based on achievement of certain earnings per share amounts. These awards are subject to adjustment based on additional financial and non-financial objectives, such as growth in revenues and operating income, operating cash flows, operating margin, return on equity, quality, integrity and compliance, and timely progress on strategic initiatives.

The Committee also approved providing substantially all holders of outstanding stock options of the Company the ability to elect to exercise those stock options using a net cashless exercise feature as permitted by the Companys 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. Commencing in 2006 and subsequent years, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a reduction in the quarterly grants of non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors from 10,000 shares to 8,000 shares and reduced the initial one-time grant of non-qualified stock options to new directors from 72,000 shares to 58,000 shares.

Grant Number:
     
(the "Optionee") the option (the "Option") to purchase that number of shares of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Common Stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), indicated above (the "Option Shares"). The Option that this Certificate represents will expire on the Expiration Date, unless it is terminated prior to that time in accordance with this Certificate.
The Option Shares represented by this Certificate shall become exercisable as to 25% of the Option Shares on each anniversary of the Grant Date, commencing with the first anniversary, unless this Option shall have terminated or the vesting shall have accelerated as provided in this Certificate. Once this Option has become exercisable for all or a portion of the Option Shares, it will remain exercisable for all or such portion of the Option Shares, as the case may be, until the Option expires or is terminated as provided in this Certificate.
By accepting this Option, the holder acknowledges that the holder of this Option will not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Option Shares until the holder has duly exercised the Option and paid the Exercise Price and applicable withholding taxes in accordance with this Certificate. The holder further acknowledges and agrees that the Company may deliver, by electronic mail, the use of the Internet or Company intranet web pages or otherwise, any information concerning the Company, this Option, the UnitedHealth Group Incorporated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which the Company granted this Option, and any information required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
This Option is subject to the further terms and conditions set forth below and to the terms of the Plan. A copy of the Plan is available upon request. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and this Certificate, the terms of the Plan shall govern. Any terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
. The Company does not intend that the Option shall be an Incentive Stock Option governed by the provisions of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Nonqualified Option
. The Option shall terminate on the Expiration Date. The Option shall terminate prior to such date if the Optionee ceases to be employed by the Company or its subsidiaries, except that:
Termination of Option
(a) If the Optionee's employment terminates for any reason (voluntary or involuntary) other than death or permanent long-term disability, the Optionee may, at any time within the Exercise Period (as defined below), exercise the Option to the extent of the full number of Option Shares which were exercisable and which the Optionee was entitled to purchase under the Option on the date of the termination of his or her employment;
General:
(b) If the Optionee dies while employed by the Company or its subsidiaries, or if the Optionee's employment by the Company or its subsidiaries is terminated due to the Optionee's failure to return to work as the result of a permanent long-term disability which renders the Optionee incapable of performing his or her duties as determined under the provisions of the Company's long-term disability insurance program, then (i) all unvested Option Shares hereunder shall immediately vest, and (ii) the Optionee (or the Optionee's personal representatives, administrators or guardians, as applicable, or any person or persons to whom the Option is transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution) may, at any time within a period of five years after the Optionee's death or termination of employment due to the Optionee's failure to return to work as the result of a permanent long-term disability, or for such other longer period established at the discretion of the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, exercise the Option to the extent of the full number of Option Shares which are exercisable following such vesting; and
Death or Permanent Long-Term Disability:
(c) If the Optionee is entitled to severance under the Company's severance pay plan as in effect on the date hereof, then vesting of the Option shall continue for the period of such severance. If Optionee is entitled to severance under an employment agreement entered into with the Company, then vesting of the Option shall continue for the period of such severance that Optionee is entitled to receive as of the date hereof. If the Optionee is entitled to separation pay other than under the Company's severance pay plan or an employment agreement, then vesting of the Option shall continue for the lesser of (i) the period the Optionee would have received payments under the severance pay plan as in effect on the date hereof, had the Optionee been eligible for such payments; or (ii) the period of separation pay. In either case, should the Optionee be paid in a lump sum versus bi-weekly payments, the Option shall continue to vest for the time in which severance or separation pay would have been paid had it been paid bi-weekly.
Severance:
For the purposes of this Option, "Exercise Period" shall mean the greater of (i) a period of three months after the date of termination of the Optionee's employment, (ii) if Optionee receives severance or separation pay, a period of three months after vesting ceases as provided in (c), above, or (iii) such other longer period established at the discretion of the Committee or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This Option shall in no event be exercisable after the Expiration Date.
. If the Optionee violates: (i) any provision of the Restrictive Covenants of this Certificate, or (ii) any provision of the Company's Principles of Integrity and Compliance, then all unvested portions of the Option Shares, together with any portions of the Option Shares which vested within one year prior to the termination of the Optionee's employment with the Company or at any time after such termination (the "Forfeited Shares"), shall become null and void and the Optionee shall pay to the Company, upon demand, an amount equal to the difference between the proceeds the Optionee has received from any sales of Forfeited Shares over the Exercise Price for such stock; and if the Optionee still holds all or any part of the Forfeited Shares at the time such Company demand is made, the Optionee shall pay over to the Company an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Forfeited Shares on the date the Option was exercised and the aggregate Exercise Price with respect to such Forfeited Shares. This paragraph does not constitute the Company's exclusive remedy for the Optionee's violation of the Restrictive Covenants. The Company may seek any additional legal or equitable remedy, including injunctive relief, for any such violation.
Forfeiture of Option
In consideration of the terms of this Option and the Optionee's access to Confidential Information, the Optionee agrees to the Restrictive Covenants set forth below. For purposes of these Restrictive Covenants, the "Company" means UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and all of its subsidiaries and other affiliates.
Restrictive Covenants.
(a) The Optionee will be given access to and provided with sensitive, confidential, proprietary and trade secret information ("Confidential Information") in the course of the Optionee's employment. Examples of Confidential Information include: inventions; new product or marketing plans; business strategies and plans; merger and acquisition targets; financial and pricing information; computer programs, source codes, models and databases; analytical models; customer lists and information; and supplier and vendor lists and information. The Optionee agrees not to disclose or use Confidential Information, either during or after the Optionee's employment with the Company, except as necessary to perform the Optionee's duties or as the Company may consent in writing.
Confidential Information.
(b) During the Optionee's employment and for the greater of two years after the termination of the Optionee's employment for any reason whatsoever or the period of time for which the Option remains exercisable, the Optionee may not, without the Company's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, for the Optionee or for any other person or entity, as agent, employee, officer, director, consultant, owner, principal, partner or shareholder, or in any other individual or representative capacity:
Non-Solicitation.
(c) . During the Optionee's employment and for the greater of one year after the termination of the Optionee's employment for any reason whatsoever or the period of time for which the Option remains exercisable, the Optionee may not, without the Company's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, for the Optionee or for any other person or entity, as agent, employee, officer, director, consultant, owner, principal, partner or shareholder, or in any other individual or representative capacity:
Non-Competition
By accepting this Option, the Optionee agrees that the provisions of this Restrictive Covenants section are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company.
. On the terms set forth herein, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time by delivering notice of exercise to the Company, accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price and any applicable withholding taxes (i) in cash, by wire transfer, certified check or bank cashier's check payable to the Company, (ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Optionee or (iii) by delivery of a combination of cash and such shares; provided, that the Optionee shall not be entitled to tender shares of Common Stock pursuant to successive, substantially simultaneous exercises of options to purchase Common Stock. Any shares already owned by the Optionee referred to in the preceding sentence must have been owned by the Optionee for no less than six months prior to the date of exercise of the Option if such shares were acquired upon the exercise of another option or upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units.
Manner of Exercise
. This Option does not confer on the Optionee any right with respect to the continuance of any relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries, nor will it interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate such relationship at any time.
No Guarantee of Employment
. During the Optionee's lifetime, only the Optionee can exercise the Option. The Optionee may not transfer the Option except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the rules promulgated thereunder, to the extent provided in clause (b) under the section above entitled "Termination of Option." Any attempt to otherwise transfer the Option shall be void.
No Transfer
. In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affecting the Shares would be reasonably likely to result in the diminution or enlargement of any of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Option (including, without limitation, the benefits or potential benefits of provisions relating to the term, vesting or exercisability of the Option), the Committee shall, in such manner as it shall deem equitable or appropriate in order to prevent such diminution or enlargement of any such benefits or potential benefits, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of shares (or other securities or other property) subject to the Option and (ii) the exercise price with respect to the Option; provided, however, that the number of shares covered by the Option shall always be a whole number. Without limiting the foregoing, if any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or consolidation or merger of the Company with another entity, or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to another entity, shall be effected in such a way that holders of the Company's Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities, cash or other assets with respect to or in exchange for such shares, the Optionee shall have the right to purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in this Certificate and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock of the Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the Option, with appropriate adjustments to prevent diminution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Option, such shares of stock, other securities, cash or other assets as would have been issued or delivered to the Optionee if the Optionee had exercised the Option and had received such shares of Common Stock prior to such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale. The Company shall not effect any such reorganization, consolidation, merger or sale unless prior to the consummation thereof the successor entity (if other than the Company) resulting from such reorganization, consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets shall assume by written instrument the obligation to deliver to the Optionee such shares of stock, securities, cash or other assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Optionee may be entitled to purchase or receive.
Adjustments to Option Shares
. Notwithstanding the other vesting provisions set forth herein, but subject to the other terms and conditions set forth herein, the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable on the effective date of a Change in Control. For purposes of this Option, a "Change in Control" shall mean the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or any merger, reorganization, or exchange or tender offer which, in each case, will result in a change in the power to elect 50% or more of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Change in Control
. If a court or arbitrator decides that any provision of this Certificate is invalid or overbroad, the Optionee agrees that the court or arbitrator should narrow such provision so that it is enforceable or, if narrowing is not possible or permissible, such provision should be considered severed and the other provisions of this Certificate should be unaffected.
Narrowed Enforcement and Severability
. The Optionee agrees that (a) legal remedies (money damages) for any breach of the Restrictive Covenants in this Certificate will be inadequate, (b) the Company will suffer immediate and irreparable harm from any such breach, and (c) the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief from a court in addition to any legal remedies the Company may seek in arbitration.
Injunctive Relief
. The Restrictive Covenants in this Certificate shall survive the termination of the Option.
Survival
. An original record of this Certificate and all the terms thereof is held on file by the Company. To the extent there is any conflict between the terms contained in this certificate and the terms contained in the original held by the Company, the terms of the original held by the Company shall control. Neither the Plan nor the Option shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and Optionee or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Option, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.

A copy of the Plan is available upon request. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and this Award, the terms of the Plan shall govern. Any terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
1. . With respect to the Shares, on and after the Award Date and until the date or dates on which the Shares vest and the restrictions with respect to the Shares lapse in accordance with Section 2, 3 or 4, Participant shall have all of the rights of a shareholder of the Common Stock, including the right to vote the Shares and the right to receive dividends thereon, unless and until the Shares are forfeited pursuant to Section 4 or 6. The rights of Participant with respect to the Shares shall remain forfeitable at all times prior to the date or dates on which such rights become vested, and the restrictions with respect to the Shares lapse, in accordance with Section 2, 3 or 4. Subject to the restrictions and terms of this Award, after the Shares vest pursuant to Section 2, 3 or 4, Participant shall have all of the rights of a shareholder of the Common Stock with respect to the Shares (including, without limitation, the right to vote the Shares and to receive cash dividends).
Rights of the Participant with Respect to the Shares
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Award, 25% of the Shares shall vest, and the restrictions with respect to the Shares shall lapse, on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Award Date if Participant remains continuously employed by the Company or continues to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company until the respective vesting dates.
Vesting
3. . Notwithstanding the other vesting provisions contained in Section 2, but subject to the other terms and conditions set forth herein, upon the effective date of a Change in Control, all of the Shares shall become immediately and unconditionally vested and exercisable, and the restrictions with respect to all of the Shares shall lapse. For purposes of this Award, a "Change in Control" shall mean the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or any merger, reorganization, or exchange or tender offer which, in each case, will result in a change in the power to elect 50% or more of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Early Vesting Upon Change in Control
4. .
Forfeiture or Early Vesting Upon Termination of Employment
(a) . If, prior to vesting of the Shares pursuant to Section 2 or 3, Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company, or ceases to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company, for any reason (voluntary or involuntary) other than death, permanent long-term disability or a termination of employment that results in severance or separation pay being paid to Participant, then Participant's rights to all of the unvested Shares shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited.
Termination of Employment Generally
(b) . If Participant dies while employed by the Company or its subsidiaries, or if Participant's employment by the Company or its subsidiaries is terminated due to Participant's failure to return to work as the result of a permanent long-term disability that renders Participant incapable of performing his or her duties as determined under the provisions of the Company's long-term disability insurance program applicable to Participant, then all unvested Shares shall become immediately vested, and the restrictions with respect to all of the Shares shall lapse, as of the date of such long-term disability or death. No transfer by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution of any Shares that vest by reason of Participant's death shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with written notice of such transfer and a copy of the will or such other evidence as the committee of the Board of Directors administering the Plan (the "Committee") may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer.
Death or Permanent Long-Term Disability
(c) . If Participant is entitled to severance under the Company's severance pay plan as in effect on the date hereof, then the Shares shall continue to vest, and the restrictions with respect to the Shares shall continue to lapse, for the period of such severance.

If Participant is entitled to separation pay other than under the Company's severance pay plan or an employment agreement, then vesting of the Shares, and lapsing of their restrictions, shall continue for the lesser of (i) the period Participant would have received payments under the severance pay plan as in effect on the date hereof, had Participant been eligible for such payments; or (ii) the period of separation pay. In either case, should Participant be paid in a lump sum versus bi-weekly payments, the Shares shall continue to vest for the time in which severance or separation pay would have been paid had it been paid bi-weekly.
Severance
5. . Until the Shares vest pursuant to Section 2, 3 or 4, the Shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of or encumbered, and no attempt to transfer unvested Shares, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, shall vest the transferee with any interest or right in or with respect to the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may, in the manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise the rights of Participant and receive any property distributable with respect to the Shares upon the death of Participant.
