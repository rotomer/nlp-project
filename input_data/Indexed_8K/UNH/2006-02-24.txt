The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the acquisitions of PacifiCare, Oxford and MAMSI by UnitedHealth Group as if the acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of the respective periods for purposes of the pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the acquisition of PacifiCare by UnitedHealth Group as if the acquisition had occurred on September 30, 2005 for purposes of the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2005.
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets of an acquired entity based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the transaction. A final determination of these fair values will include management's consideration of a valuation prepared by an independent valuation specialist. This valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired entity that exist as of the closing date of the transaction.
 
Because this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values, the actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the transaction may differ materially from the information presented in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. In addition to the independent valuation, the impact of any integration activities could cause material differences from the information presented below. Potential synergies which may result from the integration of physician, hospital, and other health care provider networks and operating and administrative activities have been excluded from the pro forma condensed combined financial information.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of UnitedHealth Group and PacifiCare. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of UnitedHealth Group that would have been reported had the transactions been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of UnitedHealth Group.
