In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that he expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Minnesota. Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, such counsel has relied, to the extent he deems proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and certificates of public officials;
(d) At the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2004

11. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon, (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) or an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities
provided, however
 
through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities.
(b) Each Underwriter will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , that if the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such action and the indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel, including local counsel, shall be borne by the indemnifying party or parties and reimbursed to the indemnified party as incurred. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any
provided, however
 
pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 11 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 11 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
12. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 9 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 11 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
13. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
14. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 12 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof; but, if for any other reason the Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof.

Exhibit 4.1
Pursuant to the Senior Debt Securities Indenture dated as of November 15, 1998, as amended by an Amendment to Indenture dated November 6, 2000 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee") and resolutions adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on February 3, 2004 and August 2, 2005, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 104 of the Indenture. This Officers' Certificate and Company Order shall be treated for all purposes under the Indenture as a supplemental indenture thereto.
All conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to (i) the establishment of a series of Securities, (ii) the establishment of the form of Securities of such series and (iii) the procedures for authentication and delivery of such series of securities have been complied with.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
A. .
Establishment of a series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture
There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms:
(1) The Securities shall bear the title "Floating Rate Notes due March 2, 2009" (referred to herein as the "Notes").
(2) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be issued pursuant to this Officers' Certificate and Company Order shall be limited to $650,000,000 except for (a) Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Section 304, 305, 306, 1007 or 1205 of the Indenture, (b) Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered thereunder and (c) any Securities of this series which are issued in the manner contemplated by paragraph 18 hereof.
(3) Interest will be payable to the Person in whose name a Note (or any Predecessor Security) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date (as defined below) immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date (as defined below). In the event that a payment of principal or interest is due on a date that is not a
Business Day (as defined below), the related payment of principal or interest shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be. "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. "London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
(4) The Stated Maturity Date of the Notes shall be March 2, 2009.
(5) The Notes shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR (as defined below) plus 0.08%, as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined below) (based on a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed) from March 2, 2006, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, payable quarterly on March 2, June 2, September 2 and December 2 in each year, commencing June 2, 2006, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Each such March 2, June 2, September 2 and December 2 shall be an "Interest Payment Date" for the Notes, and each February 15, May 18, August 18 and November 17 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding an Interest Payment Date for the Notes shall be the "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
The provision related to interest on overdue principal in Section 501 of the Indenture shall not be applicable to the Notes.
The rate of interest on the Notes will be 4.92% on March 2, 2006, and will be reset on each Interest Payment Date thereafter (the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date").
On each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on the Notes shall be determined with respect to an Interest Determination Date. The second London Business Day preceding an Interest Reset Date will be the interest determination date (the "Interest Determination Date") for that Interest Reset Date.
Interest on each of the Notes will accrue from, and including, March 2, 2006, to, and excluding, the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be, each such period an "Interest Period." Accrued interest from March 2, 2006, or from the last date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which interest is being calculated shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of the applicable Note by the applicable accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from March 2, 2006, or from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which accrued interest is being
 
calculated. The Accrued Interest Factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the per annum interest rate applicable to such day by 360. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date and falls after the first Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date or (iii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date and falls before the first Interest Reset Date, 4.92%.
All percentages resulting from the above calculation will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)) and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
LIBOR will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions:
(i) With respect to an Interest Period, LIBOR will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in United States dollars having a three-month maturity that appears on Telerate Page 3750 at approximately 11:00 A.M. London time on the Interest Determination Date. If on an Interest Determination Date such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750 at such time, or if the Telerate Page 3750 is not available on such date, then LIBOR, in respect of that Interest Determination Date, will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in (ii) below.
(ii) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears as specified in (i) above, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg's "BBAM." If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750 or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM" on an Interest Rate Determination Date at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation of the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market for three-month deposits in United States dollars in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in New York City, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide a quotation of the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) offered by it for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the interest period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so
 
provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
"Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page 3750" on the Moneyline Telerate service, or any successor service (or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service), for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars.
The Bank of New York will be the "Calculation Agent." The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing. On or before each Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the interest rate and notify the paying agent. All calculations of the Calculation Agent, in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding and neither the Trustee nor the paying agent shall have the duty to verify determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent. The determinations of the Accrued Interest Factor made by the paying agent shall be conclusive and binding. The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date on a Note will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
(6) Principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes will be payable, and, except as provided in Section 305 of the Indenture with respect to a Global Security (as defined below), the transfer of the Notes will be registrable and Notes will be exchangeable for notes bearing identical terms and provisions at the corporate trust office of The Bank of New York, in the City of New York, New York, , , that payment of principal or interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto as shown on the Security Register.

(15) The portion of the principal amount of the Notes which shall be payable upon declaration of acceleration of maturity thereof shall not be less than the principal amount thereof.
(16) The Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, as Depositary, and will be represented by a global security (a "Global Security") registered in the name of a nominee of the Depositary. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Notes represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes.
(17) The defeasance provisions set forth in Article IX of the Indenture shall apply to the Notes.
(18) The Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, issue additional notes with the same terms as the Notes in accordance with the corporate authority existing at the time of such additional issuance, and such additional notes shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the Notes.

Dated: March 2, 2006
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Notes") issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Senior Debt Securities Indenture dated as of November 15, 1998, as amended by an Amendment to Indenture dated as of November 6, 2000, as further supplemented by an Officers' Certificate and Company Order dated February 27, 2006 pursuant to Section 301 of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, as amended (together, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $650,000,000; , , that the Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes of this series, issue additional notes with the same terms as the Notes of this series, and such additional notes shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the Notes of this series.
provided
however
This Note shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR (as defined below) plus 0.08%, as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined below) (based on a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed).
The rate of interest on this Note will be 4.92% on March 2, 2006, and will be reset on each Interest Payment Date thereafter (the date on which each such reset occurs, an "Interest Reset Date").
On each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Note shall be determined with respect to an Interest Determination Date. The second London Business Day preceding an Interest Reset Date will be the interest determination date (the "Interest Determination Date") for that Interest Reset Date.
Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, March 2, 2006, to, and excluding, the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be, each such period an "Interest Period." Accrued interest from March 2, 2006, or from the last date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which interest is being calculated shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Note by the applicable accrued interest factor (the "Accrued Interest Factor"). The Accrued Interest Factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from March 2, 2006, or from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The Accrued Interest Factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the per annum interest rate applicable to such day by 360. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date and falls after the first Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the
 
immediately preceding Interest Reset Date or (iii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date and falls before the first Interest Reset Date, 4.92%.
All percentages resulting from the above calculation will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)) and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
LIBOR will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions:
(i) With respect to an Interest Period, LIBOR will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in United States dollars having a three-month maturity that appears on Telerate Page 3750 at approximately 11:00 A.M. London time on the Interest Determination Date. If on an Interest Determination Date such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750 at such time, or if the Telerate Page 3750 is not available on such date, then LIBOR, in respect of that Interest Determination Date, will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in (ii) below.
(ii) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears as specified in (i) above, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg's "BBAM." If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750 or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM" on an Interest Rate Determination Date at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation of the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market for three-month deposits in United States dollars in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in New York City, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide a quotation of the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) offered by it for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the interest period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
"Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page 3750" on the Moneyline Telerate service, or any successor service (or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service), for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars.
 
The Bank of New York will be the "Calculation Agent." The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing. On or before each Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the interest rate and notify the paying agent. All calculations of the Calculation Agent, in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding and neither the Trustee nor the paying agent shall have the duty to verify determinations of interest rates made by the Calculation Agent. The determinations of the Accrued Interest Factor made by the paying agent shall be conclusive and binding. The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date on a Note will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, and (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
Redemption
This Note is not subject to redemption prior to the Stated Maturity. This Note will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
Miscellaneous Provisions

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note, at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and in this Note, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the registry books of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee, duly executed by the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Notes of this series are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in minimal initial purchase amounts of $1,000 and any amount in excess thereafter which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series which are of like tenor for any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith, other than in certain cases provided in the Indenture.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.
All capitalized terms used in this Note which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

(ii) My opinions are subject to the effects of general principles of equity, including (without limitation) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and other similar doctrines affecting the enforceability of agreements generally (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(iii) Minnesota Statutes Section 290.371, Subd. 4, provides that any corporation required to file a Notice of Business Activities Report does not have a cause of action upon which it may bring suit under Minnesota law unless the corporation has filed a Notice of Business Activities Report and provides that the use of the courts of the State of Minnesota for all contracts executed and all causes of action that arose before the end of any period for which a corporation failed to file a required report is precluded. Insofar as my opinion may relate to the valid, binding and enforceable character of any agreement under Minnesota law or in a Minnesota court, I have assumed that any party seeking to enforce such agreement has at all times been, and will continue at all times to be, exempt from the requirement of filing a Notice of Business Activities Report or, if not exempt, has duly filed, and will continue to file, all Notice of Business Activities Reports.
My opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the States of Minnesota and New York and the federal laws of the United States of America.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and to the reference to this opinion under the caption "Legal Matters" contained in the Prospectus constituting part of the Registration Statement. The foregoing opinions are being furnished to the Company solely for its benefit and may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any other person without my prior written consent.
