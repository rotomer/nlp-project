Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 26, 2006, the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the "Company") determined that, effective immediately, only annual cash retainers and cash attendance fees for regularly scheduled quarterly board or committee meetings may be converted into nonqualified options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company. Prior to this action and as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for its 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, each non-employee director of the Company could elect to convert annual cash retainers and all cash board and committee meeting attendance fees, including those for special meetings, into nonqualified options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company. The Board of Directors believes it is more appropriate to pay directors in cash for special meeting attendance fees, rather than provide compensation in option grants.
