("Sierra") received a request for additional information from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") regarding the proposed merger between the two companies. The information request, also known as a "second request," was issued under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("HSR").
