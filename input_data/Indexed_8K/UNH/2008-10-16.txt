(For Immediate Release)

MINNEAPOLIS
Stephen J. Hemsley, president and chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group, said, "The Company's solid results reflect the early benefits of a series of actions we initiated to improve our performance. Efforts to strengthen local market execution and improve stakeholder relationships are being well received and have strong potential for longer-term gains. Other steps, such as reducing our operating cost structure and improving the positioning of 2009 benefits for most senior product offerings should have a continuing favorable effect on 2009 performance."
Third quarter net earnings per share included the absorption of $0.03 per share in estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $0.02 per share in net capital losses on investments, offset by a $0.02 per share benefit from a change in the estimate of the net costs to settle two class action lawsuits related to the Company's historical stock option matters. The Company projects net earnings in the range of $0.77 to $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
Management views year-over-year comparisons of results to be generally more meaningful than sequential comparisons, given the seasonality of revenues, medical expenses, operating costs and earnings from operations in important business lines such as Medicare Part D drug programs, high deductible insurance products and health informatics offerings.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release may contain statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook that constitute "forward-looking" statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws. Generally the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "plan," "project," "will" and similar expressions, identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors. Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: the potential consequences of the findings announced on October 15, 2006 of the investigation by an Independent Committee of directors of our historical stock option practices; the consequences of the restatement of our previous financial statements, related governmental reviews, including a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and review by the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Congressional committees, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and Minnesota Attorney General, a related review by the Special Litigation Committee of the Company, and related shareholder derivative actions, including obtaining court approval of the settlement agreements between the Company and certain named defendants and the dismissal of the derivative claims against all named defendants, shareholder demands, and purported securities and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) class actions, including the completion of final documentation relating to the settlement of the securities and ERISA class actions, obtaining approval of the proposed settlement of the securities class action by the boards of directors of the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the Company, and obtaining court approval of the proposed settlement of the securities and ERISA class actions, the resolution of matters currently subject to an injunction issued by the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, a purported notice of acceleration with respect to certain of the Company's debt securities based upon an alleged event of default under the indenture governing such securities, and recent management and director changes, and the
 
potential impact of each of these matters on our business, credit ratings and debt; increases in health care costs that are higher than we anticipated in establishing our premium rates, including increased consumption of or costs of medical services; heightened competition as a result of new entrants into our market, and consolidation of health care companies and suppliers; events that may negatively affect our contracts with AARP; uncertainties regarding changes in Medicare, including coordination of information systems and accuracy of certain assumptions; funding risks with respect to revenues received from Medicare and Medicaid programs; failure to achieve business growth targets, including membership and enrollment; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation, legislative activity and government regulation and review of our industry; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service professionals; regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, which could result in the loss of existing customers, difficulties in attracting new customers, difficulties in determining medical costs estimates and appropriate pricing, customer and physician and health care professional disputes, regulatory violations, increases in operating costs, or other adverse consequences; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for businesses that we acquire; potential noncompliance by our business associates with patient privacy data; misappropriation of our proprietary technology; failure to complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions; change in debt to total capital ratio that is lower or higher than we anticipated; and the potential consequences of the New York Attorney General's investigation into our provider reimbursement practices.
This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. A further list and description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the cautionary statements in our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Reconciliation of 2008 Forecasted Operating Results
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
REVENUES
 
 
 
 
 
Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities
 
 
Operating results excluding special items and adjusted cash flows from operations as used in the press release are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the use of each of these non-GAAP financial measures improves the comparability of our results between periods. These financial measures provide investors and our management with useful information to measure and forecast our results of operations, to compare on a consistent basis our results of operations for the current period to that of prior periods, and to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies in the health care industry.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the special items or timing of certain cash payments/receipts associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, one should not consider these measures in isolation. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as non-GAAP basis, disclosing these GAAP financial measures, and providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.
