Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
At the annual shareholders' meeting on May 23, 2011, the Company conducted a non-binding advisory vote on the issue of the frequency with which shareholders express an opinion on executive compensation ("Say on Pay"). Consistent with the recommendation of the Board of Directors, a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote in person or by proxy at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting were cast in favor of holding an annual Say-on-Pay vote. After considering the shareholders' advisory vote results, the Company has determined that it will include an annual Say-on-Pay vote in its proxy materials until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of holding a Say-on-Pay vote, which will occur no later than the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting.
