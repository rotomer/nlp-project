Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
UnitedHealth Group Incorporateds (the "Company") previously disclosed 2011 earnings per share guidance included an estimated potential assessment for the Companys pro rata share of costs for the policyholder claims of Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary ("Penn Treaty"), neither of which is affiliated with the Company. The Company will be required to accrue the assessment if and when a court declares Penn Treaty insolvent. Based on the schedule announced by the court on November 2, 2011, the Company will not accrue an assessment related to Penn Treaty in 2011 because the court will not be issuing a ruling in 2011. Accordingly, the Company has adjusted its 2011 guidance to $4.52 to $4.57 per share to reflect this new development. The information in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
