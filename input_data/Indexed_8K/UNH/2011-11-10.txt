(d) It will, pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, retain copies of each free writing prospectus used or referred to by it, in accordance with Rule 433 under the Securities Act; and
(e) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period; as used herein, the term "" means such period of time after the first date of the public offering of the Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters a prospectus relating to the Securities is required by law to be delivered (or required to be delivered but for Rule 172 under the Securities Act) in connection with sales of the Securities by any Underwriter or dealer).
Prospectus Delivery Period
9. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, any Blue Sky and legal investment memoranda, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 7(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment memoranda; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of any Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any Trustee in connection with any Indenture and the Securities; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 11 and 14 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
10. The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of the Time of Sale and at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, and that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

In addition, at the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received from such accountants, a "bring-down comfort letter" dated the Time of Delivery addressed to the Representatives, in the form of the "comfort letter" delivered on the date of the Time of Sale, except that (i) it shall cover the financial information in the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto and (ii) procedures shall be brought down to a date no more than 5 days prior to date of the Time of Delivery;
Exhibit C
(f) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information and prior to the Time of Delivery, there has been no Material Adverse Change, except as set forth in the Time of Sale Information, which in the judgment of the Representatives is so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities;
 
(g) On or after the Time of Sale (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability;
(h) On or after the Time of Sale there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York or Minnesota State authorities; and (iv) a material adverse change in the financial markets of the United States or in the international financial markets or the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or any change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities;
(i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 7(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York business day next succeeding the date of this Agreement;

(k) On or before the Time of Delivery, the Underwriters and counsel for the Underwriters shall have received such information, documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purposes of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Designated Securities as contemplated herein, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties, or the satisfaction of any of the conditions or agreements, herein contained.
11. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon, (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are
 
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities.
(b) Each Underwriter will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection to the extent it is not prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses as a proximate result of such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the
 
consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that if the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such action and the indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel, including local counsel, shall be borne by the indemnifying party or parties and reimbursed to the indemnified party as incurred. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
 
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Designated Securities distributed by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 11 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 11 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
12. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each
 
non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 9 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 11 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
13. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
14. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 12 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement, except as provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters pursuant to Section 10 hereof for any reason permissible thereunder, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities, except as provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof.
15. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: General Counsel; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 11(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address supplied to the Company by the Representatives. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
17. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
18. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
19. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof.
 
The foregoing Underwriting Agreement is hereby confirmed and accepted by the Underwriters as of the date first above written.

November 7, 2011

Exhibit 4.1
Pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company") and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") and resolutions adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on October 30, 2007, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 102 of the Indenture. This Officers' Certificate and Company Order shall be treated for all purposes under the Indenture as a supplemental indenture thereto.
All conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to (i) the establishment of a series of Securities, (ii) the establishment of the form of Securities of such series and (iii) the procedures for authentication and delivery of such series of securities have been complied with.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
A. .
Establishment of a Series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture
There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms:
 
 
 
 
 
The provision related to interest on overdue principal in Section 501 of the Indenture shall not be applicable to the Notes.
 
 
The Notes will be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at any time before November 15, 2016 (their Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield (as defined below), plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
 
For this purpose, the following terms have the following meanings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A notice of redemption may provide that it is subject to certain conditions that will be specified in the notice. If those conditions are not met, the redemption notice will be of no effect and the Company will not be obligated to redeem the Notes.
A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected on a pro rata basis (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) or in such method as the Trustee, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may provide for the selection for redemption of portions in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
Unless any Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem all the Notes of this series, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Notes of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes of this series repurchased to the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to Holders of the Notes of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
In order to accept the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, the Note together with the form entitled "Election Form" (which form is annexed to the Note) duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any exercise by a Holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal amount of the Note, but in that event the principal amount of the Note remaining outstanding after repurchase must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
 
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party purchases all Notes of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series, the following terms are applicable:
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than the Company or a Subsidiary; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or the Voting Stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Company's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors; or (5)

The term "person," as used in this definition, has the meaning given thereto in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.

"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings Inc., and its successors.
"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and its successors.
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes of this series or fails to make a rating of such Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes of this series is lowered by each of the three Rating Agencies and the Notes of this series are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the three Rating Agencies on any day during the period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes of this series is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) commencing on the date of the first public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control.
 
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
"Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.

This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $[            ]; , that the Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes of this series, issue additional notes with the same terms as the Notes of this series, and such additional notes shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the Notes of this series.
provided, however
Redemption
This Note is redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time before November 15, 2016 (its Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on this Note to be redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield (as defined below), plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
For this purpose, the following terms have the following meanings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A notice of redemption may provide that it is subject to certain conditions that will be specified in the notice. If those conditions are not met, the redemption notice will be of no effect and the Company will not be obligated to redeem this Note.
A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected on a pro rata basis (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) or in such method as the Trustee, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may provide for the selection for redemption of portions in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
 
Unless any Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
This Note will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
Change of Control Offer
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem all the Notes of this series, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Notes of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes of this series repurchased to the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to Holders of the Notes of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
In order to accept the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, this Note together with the form entitled "Election Form" (which form is annexed hereto) duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
(i) the name of the Holder of this Note;
(ii) the principal amount of this Note;
(iii) the principal amount of this Note to be repurchased;
(iv) the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of this Note;
(v) a statement that the Holder is accepting the Change of Control Offer; and
(vi) a guarantee that this Note, together with the form entitled "Election Form" duly completed, will be received by the Paying Agent at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
Any exercise by a Holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal amount of this Note, but in that event the principal amount of this Note remaining outstanding after repurchase must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
(i) accept for payment all Notes of this series or portions of such Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes of this series or portions of such Notes properly tendered; and
(iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes of this series properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series or portions of such Notes being repurchased.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party purchases all Notes of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series, the following terms are applicable:
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than the Company or a Subsidiary; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any

"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and its successors.
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes of this series or fails to make a rating of such Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
 
"Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes of this series is lowered by each of the three Rating Agencies and the Notes of this series are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the three Rating Agencies on any day during the period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes of this series is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) commencing on the date of the first public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.

Exhibit 4.2
Pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company") and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") and resolutions adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on October 30, 2007, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 102 of the Indenture. This Officers' Certificate and Company Order shall be treated for all purposes under the Indenture as a supplemental indenture thereto.
All conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to (i) the establishment of a series of Securities, (ii) the establishment of the form of Securities of such series and (iii) the procedures for authentication and delivery of such series of securities have been complied with.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
A. .
Establishment of a Series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture
There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms:
 
 
 
 
 
The provision related to interest on overdue principal in Section 501 of the Indenture shall not be applicable to the Notes.
 
 
The Notes will be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at any time before August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield (as defined below), plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
 
The Notes will be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
For this purpose, the following terms have the following meanings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A notice of redemption may provide that it is subject to certain conditions that will be specified in the notice. If those conditions are not met, the redemption notice will be of no effect and the Company will not be obligated to redeem the Notes.
A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected on a pro rata basis (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) or in such method as the Trustee, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may provide for the selection for redemption of portions in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
Unless any Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem all the Notes of this series, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Notes of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes of this series repurchased to the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice
 
shall be mailed to Holders of the Notes of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
In order to accept the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, the Note together with the form entitled "Election Form" (which form is annexed to the Note) duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any exercise by a Holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal amount of the Note, but in that event the principal amount of the Note remaining outstanding after repurchase must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party purchases all Notes of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series by virtue of any such conflict.

Dated: November             , 2011
 
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated herein and issued
pursuant to the within-mentioned
Indenture.
Dated: November             , 2011
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Notes") issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, dated as of February 4, 2008, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee), as further supplemented by an Officers' Certificate and Company Order dated November 10, 2011 pursuant to Section 301 of the indenture (together, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $[            ]; , that the Company may, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes of this series, issue additional notes with the same terms as the Notes of this series, and such additional notes shall be considered part of the same series under the Indenture as the Notes of this series.
provided, however
Redemption
This Note is redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time before August 15, 2021 (three months prior to its Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on this Note to be redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield (as defined below), plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
This Note is redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to its Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
For this purpose, the following terms have the following meanings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A notice of redemption may provide that it is subject to certain conditions that will be specified in the notice. If those conditions are not met, the redemption notice will be of no effect and the Company will not be obligated to redeem this Note.
 
A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected on a pro rata basis (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) or in such method as the Trustee, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may provide for the selection for redemption of portions in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
Unless any Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
This Note will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
Change of Control Offer
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem all the Notes of this series, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Notes of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes of this series repurchased to the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to Holders of the Notes of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
In order to accept the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, this Note together with the form entitled "Election Form" (which form is annexed hereto) duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
 
 
 
 
(iv) the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of this Note;
(v) a statement that the Holder is accepting the Change of Control Offer; and
(vi) a guarantee that this Note, together with the form entitled "Election Form" duly completed, will be received by the Paying Agent at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
Any exercise by a Holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal amount of this Note, but in that event the principal amount of this Note remaining outstanding after repurchase must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
(i) accept for payment all Notes of this series or portions of such Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes of this series or portions of such Notes properly tendered; and
(iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes of this series properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series or portions of such Notes being repurchased.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party purchases all Notes of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes of this series, the following terms are applicable:
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets

"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings Inc., and its successors.
"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company.

"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes of this series or fails to make a rating of such Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating Event" means the rating on the Notes of this series is lowered by each of the three Rating Agencies and the Notes of this series are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the three Rating Agencies on any day during the period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes of this series is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) commencing on the date of the first public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.

Exhibit 4.3
Pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company") and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") and resolutions adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on October 30, 2007, this Officers' Certificate and Company Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 102 of the Indenture. This Officers' Certificate and Company Order shall be treated for all purposes under the Indenture as a supplemental indenture thereto.
All conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to (i) the establishment of a series of Securities, (ii) the establishment of the form of Securities of such series and (iii) the procedures for authentication and delivery of such series of securities have been complied with.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
A. .
Establishment of a Series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture
There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms:
 
 
 
as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be. "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York or Minneapolis, Minnesota or at the place of payment (specified in paragraph (6) hereof) are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to remain closed.
 
 
The provision related to interest on overdue principal in Section 501 of the Indenture shall not be applicable to the Notes.
 
 
The Notes will be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at any time before May 15, 2041 (six months prior to their Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield (as defined below), plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
 
The Notes will be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2041 (six months prior to their Stated Maturity), at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
For this purpose, the following terms have the following meanings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A notice of redemption may provide that it is subject to certain conditions that will be specified in the notice. If those conditions are not met, the redemption notice will be of no effect and the Company will not be obligated to redeem the Notes.
A partial redemption of the Notes may be effected on a pro rata basis (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) or in such method as the Trustee, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems fair and appropriate. The Trustee may provide for the selection for redemption of portions in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed.
Unless any Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined herein) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem all the Notes of this series, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Notes of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes of this series repurchased to the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment").

shall be mailed to Holders of the Notes of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
In order to accept the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, the Note together with the form entitled "Election Form" (which form is annexed to the Note) duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any exercise by a Holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal amount of the Note, but in that event the principal amount of the Note remaining outstanding after repurchase must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:

In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.

For purposes of this opinion letter, we have examined copies of such agreements, instruments and documents as we have deemed an appropriate basis on which to render the opinions hereinafter expressed. In our examination of the aforesaid documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the accuracy and completeness of all documents submitted to us, the authenticity of all original documents, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies (including telecopies).

This opinion letter is given, and all statements herein are made, in the context of the foregoing.
For the purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed that (i) U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "") under the Indenture, dated as of February 4, 2008, between the Company and the Trustee, included as Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement filed on February 4, 2008 (the "") has all requisite power and authority under all applicable laws, regulations and governing documents to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture and has

We also have assumed the validity and constitutionality of each relevant statute, rule, regulation and agency action covered by this opinion letter.
This opinion letter is based as to matters of law solely on the applicable provisions of the laws of the State of New York (but not including any laws, statutes, ordinances, administrative decisions, rules or regulations of any political subdivision below the state level), as currently in effect. We express no opinion herein as to any other laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, or regulations (and in particular, we express no opinion as to any effect that such other laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, or regulations may have on the opinion expressed herein). Insofar as the opinion expressed herein relates to or is dependent upon matters governed by Minnesota law, we have relied, without independent investigation, upon, and our opinion expressed herein is subject to all of the qualifications, assumptions and limitations expressed in, the opinion of even date herewith of Kuai H.

As used herein, the term "laws of the State of New York" includes the statutory provisions contained therein, all applicable provisions of the New York Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws.
Based upon, subject to and limited by the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Debt Securities have been duly authorized on behalf of the Company and that, following (i) receipt by the Company of the consideration specified in the Pricing Agreement and (ii) the due execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Debt Securities pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Debt Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company.
The opinion expressed above with respect to the valid and binding nature of obligations may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory and other law regarding fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers) and by the exercise of judicial discretion and the application of principles of equity, good faith, fair dealing, reasonableness, conscionability and materiality (regardless of whether the Debt Securities are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
This opinion letter has been prepared for your use in connection with the filing by the Company of a Current Report on Form 8-K on the date hereof, which Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and speaks as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.2 to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference into that Registration Statement and to the reference to this firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus dated February 14, 2011 that forms a part of the Registration Statement (the "") and the supplement to the Prospectus dated November 7, 2011, each of which constitute part of the Registration Statement.
