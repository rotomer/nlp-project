Item 8.01 Other Events.
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the "Company") acquired approximately 60 percent of the outstanding shares of Amil Participaes S.A. ("Amil") from Amil's founding shareholders in October 2012 and expects to launch a tender offer to purchase approximately 30 percent of Amil's outstanding common shares from public shareholders in the first quarter of 2013. The Company has obtained exemptive relief from the provisions of Rule 14e-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, permitting the Company, certain of its affiliates or brokers or nominees acting on their behalf (collectively, the "Representatives") to make purchases of Amil shares outside of the tender offer, subject to certain conditions. Therefore, the Company, certain of its affiliates or their Representatives may from time to time make purchases of Amil shares outside of the United States in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Information about such purchases will be disclosed as required by applicable laws in Brazil and the United States.
