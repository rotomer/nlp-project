Portland, ME and Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) today reported after-tax operating income before special items and net realized investment losses of $155.0 million ($0.64 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2002. These results compare to $148.6 million ($0.61 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2001. Including the impact of the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, which resulted in after-tax losses of $15.6 million ($0.06 per diluted common share), income before net realized investment losses totaled $133.0 million ($0.55 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2001.
 
Net income for the third quarter of 2002 was $109.2 million ($0.45 per diluted common share) compared to $127.1 million ($0.52 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2001. Included in the net income results are net realized after-tax investment losses of $45.8 million ($0.19 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2002 and $5.9 million ($0.03 per diluted common share) million in the third quarter of 2001.
 
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer J. Harold Chandler said, "Third quarter results were in line with our plans and the expectations of the market. However, we remain conservative in our forecasting due to the less favorable economic environment that is generally predicted by most public and private sources. Nevertheless, our focus remains on operating
our Company more efficiently and selectively extending our leadership positions."
 
Results by Segment
 
The segment, which includes group disability, group life, accidental death and dismemberment coverages ("AD&D"), group long-term care, and the results of managed disability, reported income before net realized investment gains and losses and federal income taxes ("income") of $149.1 million in the third quarter of 2002, compared to $126.4 million in the third quarter of 2001. Excluding before-tax losses of $14.0 million related to September 11
Employee Benefits
th
, income in the year ago quarter was $140.4 million.
 
Within the segment, the group disability line reported income of $85.4 million compared to $79.1 million in the prior year third quarter. Excluding before-tax losses of $7.3 million related to September 11
th
, income in the year ago quarter was $86.4 million. The lower earnings are the result of a decline in earnings in the Company's short-term disability line of business, which more than offset an improvement in earnings in the long-term disability line of business.
 
Also within the Employee Benefits segment, the group life, AD&D, and group long-term care lines of business reported income of $59.2 million, compared to income of $44.1 million in the year ago quarter. Excluding before-tax losses of $6.7 million related to September 11
th
, income in the year ago quarter was $50.8 million. The improvement was primarily the result of earnings improvement in the group life and group long-term care lines, which more than offset a decline in earnings from the AD&D line of business.
 
Premium income for the Employee Benefits segment increased 6.6 percent to $1,176.1 million in the third quarter of 2002, compared to $1,102.9 million in the third quarter of 2001. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group long-term disability increased 16.9 percent to $63.0 million in the third quarter of 2002, from $53.9 million in the third quarter of 2001. Consistent with the Company's revised strategy, new annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group short-term disability fully-insured products declined 43.8 percent to $13.2 million in the third quarter of 2002, from $23.5 million in the third quarter of 2001, while group short-term disability administrative services only (ASO) premium equivalents increased 18.7 percent to $15.9 million in the third quarter of 2002, from $13.4 million in the year ago quarter. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group life, AD&D, and group long-term care totaled $50.2 million in the third quarter of 2002 and $50.1 million in the third quarter of 2001.
 
Premium persistency in the Company's long-term disability block improved to 85.5 percent for the third quarter of 2002 compared to 84.8 percent in the third quarter of 2001. Persistency was stable in the short-term disability line relative to a year ago, but declined slightly when compared to the prior year in the group life line of business due to continued marketplace competitiveness. The additional amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs for persistency adjustments in the third quarter of 2002 totaled $8.7 million in the Employee Benefits segment, compared to $8.5 million in the third quarter of 2001. The profitability of the terminated business in this segment continues to be less than that of the in-force business.
 
The segment includes results from the individual disability and individual long-term care lines of business. The Individual segment reported income of $70.7 million in the third quarter of 2002, compared to $61.3 million in the third quarter of 2001. Excluding before-tax losses of $10.0 million related to September 11
Individual
th
, income in the year ago quarter was $71.3 million.
 
Within this segment, the individual disability line of business reported income of $68.8 million in the third quarter of 2002, compared to income of $56.7 million in the year ago quarter. Excluding before-tax losses of $10.0 million related to September 11
th
, income in the year ago quarter was $66.7 million. Income in the individual long-term care line of business was $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2002 compared to $4.6 million for the same period of 2001. The lower income in this line primarily resulted from a higher benefit ratio, caused by higher new claims volumes.
 
Premium income in the Individual segment increased 5.2 percent to $478.0 million in the third quarter of 2002, compared to $454.3 million in the third quarter of 2001. New annualized sales in the individual disability line totaled $36.4 million in the third quarter of 2002, compared to $35.3 million in the third quarter of 2001. New annualized sales in the individual long-term care line totaled $16.6 million in the third quarter of 2002, compared to $13.1 million in the year ago quarter.
