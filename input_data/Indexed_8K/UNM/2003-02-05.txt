February 5, 2003
 
 
Portland, ME and Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) today reported after-tax operating income before special items, net realized investment losses, and extraordinary items of $155.1 million ($0.64 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2002. These results compare to $150.9 million ($0.62 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2001.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $94.3 million ($0.39 per diluted common share) compared to $124.0 million ($0.51 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2001. Included in the net income results are net realized after-tax investment losses of $60.8 million ($0.25 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $18.6 million ($0.08 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2001. Also included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2001 is a special item which reduced net income by $5.4 million ($0.02 per diluted common share) related to the write off of the remaining goodwill associated with the Company's operations in Argentina and an extraordinary loss of $2.9 million ($0.01 per diluted common share) related to the early extinguishment of debt.
 
 
 
A reconciliation from after-tax operating income as discussed above to net income is as follows:
 
 
 
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer J. Harold Chandler said, "We are pleased that our fourth quarter results were in line with the expectations of the market, despite the challenging economic and business environment. We are focused on selected growth opportunities, both from a product and geographic objective, which are capable of generating attractive long-term returns. While today's environment creates challenges to achieve our growth and profitability potential, we believe we have a solid financial and business plan but will continue to be cautious in our outlook for 2003."
 
Results by Segment
 
The segment, which includes group disability, group life, accidental death and dismemberment coverages ("AD&D"), group long-term care, and the results of managed disability, reported income before special items, net realized investment gains and losses, and federal income taxes ("income") of $165.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $147.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Employee Benefits
 
Within the segment, the group disability line reported income of $75.6 million compared to $80.8 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The lower earnings are the result of a decline in earnings from the short-term disability line of business, which offset a slight increase in earnings from the long-term disability line of business.
 
Also within the Employee Benefits segment, the group life, AD&D, and group long-term care lines of business reported income of $83.9 million, compared to income of $63.0 million in the year ago
 
quarter. The improvement was primarily the result of favorable risk experience in all three lines of business.
 
Premium income for the Employee Benefits segment increased 5.8 percent to $1,175.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $1,110.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group long-term disability fully-insured products declined 12.6 percent to $175.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, from $200.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, while group long-term disability administrative services only (ASO) premium equivalents increased 3.4 percent to $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, from $8.8 million in the year ago quarter. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group short-term disability fully-insured products declined 31.3 percent to $53.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, from $77.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, while group short-term disability administrative services only (ASO) premium equivalents increased 74.7 percent to $111.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, from $63.6 million in the year ago quarter. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group life, AD&D, and group long-term care totaled $171.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $199.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.
 
Premium persistency in the Company's long-term disability block improved to 85.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to 84.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001. Consistent with the Company's previously articulated strategy, persistency declined slightly in both the short-term disability and group life lines of business relative to a year ago. Excluding terminations resulting from transfers of fully insured to administrative services only, short-term disability persistency was higher than the prior year fourth quarter.
 
The segment includes results from the individual disability and individual long-term care lines of business. The Individual segment reported income of $66.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $67.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Individual
 
Within this segment, the individual disability line of business reported income of $67.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to income of $61.0 million in the year ago quarter. Higher revenues and a lower expense ratio in this line were partially offset by a higher benefit ratio. Losses in the individual long-term care line of business were $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to income of $6.3 million for the same period of 2001. The lower income in this line primarily resulted from a higher benefit ratio, which offset higher revenues.
 
Premium income in the Individual segment increased 5.4 percent to $484.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $459.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. New annualized sales in the
individual disability line totaled $42.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. New annualized sales in the individual long-term care line totaled $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $15.2 million in the year ago quarter.
 
The segment which includes the results of products sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace, reported income of $43.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $43.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Premium income for this segment increased 8.5 percent to $218.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $200.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. New annualized sales in this segment increased 4.9 percent to $102.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, from $97.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Voluntary Benefits
,
 
The segment, which includes results from products no longer actively marketed, reported income of $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to $12.5 million in the year ago quarter.
Other
 
The segment which includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, amortization of goodwill for the prior year period, and certain corporate expenses, reported a loss of $50.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to a loss of $40.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, excluding special items.
Corporate
,
 
The net realized after-tax investment losses in the fourth quarter of 2002, which totaled $60.8 million, were comprised of gross realized before-tax investment losses and write-downs of $109.9 million and gross realized before-tax investment gains of $16.7 million, for net realized before-tax investment losses of $93.2 million. For the fourth quarter of 2001, net realized after-tax investment losses, which totaled $18.6 million, were comprised of gross realized before-tax investment losses and write-downs of $85.4 million, and gross realized before-tax investment gains of $56.6 million, for net realized before-tax investment losses of $28.8 million.
 
As of December 31, 2002, book value per common share was $28.33, compared to $24.52 a year ago. Book value per share excluding net unrealized gains and losses on securities was $24.37, compared to $23.95 a year ago.
 
Continued declines in the performance of equity investment markets combined with steadily increasing pension liabilities have reduced the Company's pension plan's funding level. In December 2002, in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Account Standards No. 87, , the Company recorded a $145.0 million non-cash additional minimum pension liability adjustment, net of deferred federal income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.
Employer's Accounting for Pensions
 
The Company has responded to requests for information from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with a review of the Company's SEC periodic filings relating, primarily, to its investment disclosures and to the timing and amount of other-than-temporary losses recorded on below-investment-grade securities. The Company will continue to respond to the SEC staff's requests and will provide additional disclosures relating to its investment portfolio in its future SEC filings. While the final outcome of the discussions is uncertain, the Company believes it has a sound process for determining the timing and amount of impaired assets and will continue to work with the staff on this important issue.
