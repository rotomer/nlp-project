Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) today reported a net loss of $246.4 million ($1.02 per diluted common share) for the first quarter of 2003, compared to net income of $87.9 million ($0.36 per diluted common share) for the first quarter of 2002. Included in the net loss for the first quarter of 2003 is an increase in the Company's group long-term income protection GAAP reserves of $454.0 million before tax, or $295.1 million after tax ($1.22 per diluted common share).
 
In April of 2003, the Company completed an analysis of its assumptions related to its group long-term income protection claim reserves. This analysis was initiated based on a trend in lower net claim recovery rates observed during the first quarter of 2003. The claim recovery rates during the first quarter were below expected levels and were lower than those experienced in the past three years. The analysis of emerging net claim recovery rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the Company's long-term expectations. Based on the analysis noted above, the Company increased its group long-term income protection claim reserves as of March 31, 2003 to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim recovery rates, but a change in claim recovery rates by claim duration. This increase represents a 6.2 percent increase in total net group long-term income protection reserves as of March 31, 2003, which were $7.34 billion prior to this increase.
 
 
Also included in the net income (loss) for the first quarter are net realized after-tax investment losses of $57.6 million ($0.24 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2003 and $56.1 million ($0.23 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2002. The first quarter of 2003 also includes severance and pension benefits related to the previously announced management change totaling $9.8 million after tax ($0.04 per diluted common share). Excluding the impact of the reserve increase and the net realized investment losses, after-tax operating income for the first quarter of 2003 totaled $106.3 million ($0.44 per diluted common share) compared to $151.1 million ($0.62 per diluted common share) for the first quarter of 2002.
 
Included in the first quarter of 2002 net income is a write-down of goodwill of $11.0 million before tax, or $7.1 million after tax ($0.03 per diluted common share). The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, in the first quarter of 2002. The transitional impairment tests of goodwill resulted in the write-down, which was reported as a cumulative effect of accounting principle change.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
 
A reconciliation from after-tax operating income, excluding the reserve increase, net realized investment loss, and cumulative effect of accounting principle change, to net income (loss) is as follows:
 
 
 
2003 Guidance
 
The Company has established its guidance for 2003 operating income, excluding the reserve increase and net realized investment gains and losses, within a range of $1.70 to $1.80 per diluted common share. This guidance takes into account the impact of the Company's financial restructuring plan announced today, including the dilution expected as a result of the proposed common stock offering, as well as the impact of the investment portfolio restructuring on future net investment income, the lower discount rates on new claim incurrals, and the Company's projection of a continued challenging claims environment. Guidance on net realized investment gains and losses for 2003 is unavailable at this time.
 
Results by Segment
 
 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company has adjusted its reporting segments to more closely reflect the manner in which it manages its business internally and will be reporting on this new segment basis beginning with the first quarter of 2003. The segment contains the results of its group income protection lines of business (both long-term and short-term income protection), the individual income protection line, the long-term care lines of business (both group and individual), and the disability services line. The segment contains the results of the group life line of business, the accidental death and dismemberment line, and the voluntary life and other lines written through the brokerage distribution system. The segment contains the results of Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Colonial segment markets products through an agency field distribution system to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace. The segment contains the results from products no longer actively marketed, and the segment includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, and certain corporate expenses.

The segment reported an operating loss before net realized investment gains and losses and federal income taxes of $353.8 million, including the reserve increase of $454.0 million for the group long-term income protection line of business.

Operating income in the recently issued individual income protection business totaled $44.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 compared to $41.6 million in the first quarter of 2002.

Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) announced today a series of actions to increase the Company's financial strength and improve the predictability of its business. These actions will result in reduced debt leverage and inter-company loans, improved capitalization of the Company's insurance subsidiaries, and an improved risk profile for the Company's investment portfolio. Significant aspects of this plan are expected to be substantially completed during the second quarter of 2003.
 
The principal components of the financial restructuring include the following:
 
 
 
 
With this change, a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per common share will be paid on May 16, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 5, 2003.
 
 
 
 
 
"The actions announced today are designed to increase our financial strength and reflect a more conservative approach to the business," said Thomas R. Watjen, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are confident in our ability to execute these initiatives in the near term. Through these actions, along with a strong business plan supported by over 13,000 dedicated employees, we believe we are positioned to build on our market leading position and better serve our customers. In doing so we are confident we will produce more predictable results for our shareholders."
 
The Company expects the impact of this financial restructuring plan to reduce its debt leverage (calculated to allow partial credit for the mandatory convertible securities and the Company's existing trust preferred securities) from 27.7 percent at year-end 2002 to approximately 24 percent. The impact of the direct capital contributions and conserved capital within the insurance subsidiaries will strengthen the consolidated risk based capital ratio ("RBC"). The consolidated RBC ratio, as calculated on the NAIC company action level basis, is expected to approximate 250 percent by year-end 2003, compared to a year-end 2002 level of 210 percent. Going forward, the Company intends to maintain its debt leverage below 25 percent and over the next two years further strengthen its RBC ratio and reduce its inter-company loan balance.
