     named in Schedule I to Annex I hereto,
85 Broad Street
New York, New York 10004.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
From time to time UnumProvident Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain shares of its Common Stock, par value $.10 per share (the "Shares") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Firm Shares" and together with any Optional Shares, as defined below, the "Designated Shares"), less the number of Designated Shares covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, as provided in Section 3 hereof and as may be specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, any Designated Shares to be covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts being herein sometimes referred to as "Contract Shares" and the Designated Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters (after giving effect to the deduction, if any, for Contract Shares) being herein sometimes referred to as "Underwriters' Shares").
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Shares shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto.
1.
Particular sales of Designated Shares may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Shares, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Shares in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Shares or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Shares. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Shares and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Shares shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement with respect to Designated Shares shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex I and shall specify the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the names of the Representatives, if any, of such Underwriters, the aggregate number of Firm Shares and the maximum
number of Optional Shares, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriter with respect thereto, the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Shares, whether any of such Designated Shares shall be covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined in Section 3 hereof), the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the nature of the funds to be delivered by the Underwriters and the initial public offering price or the manner of determining such price, if any. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted). The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
2.
The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
(a)
Two registration statements on Form S-3 (No. 333-43808 and No. 333-100953), including a prospectus pursuant to Rule 429 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in respect of the Shares, as well as certain other securities of the Company, preferred securities of UnumProvident Financing Trust II and UnumProvident Financing Trust III (collectively, the "Trusts") and guarantees by the Company with respect to the preferred securities of the Trusts, have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statements and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters and, excluding exhibits to such registration statements, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectuses contained therein, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement, if any, increasing the size of the offering (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Act, which became effective upon filing, no other document with respect to such registration statements or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, each in the form heretofore delivered to the Representatives); such prospectus included for use in connection with the Shares pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act meets the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder for use of such prospectus in connection with the Shares; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of either of such registration statements, any post-effective amendment thereto, or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. Any preliminary prospectus included in either of such registration statements or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) or Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, is hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus;" the various parts of such registration statements and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectuses contained in such registration statements and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, at the time such part of such registration statements or such part of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, became or hereafter becomes effective, each as amended at the time such part of the registration statements or such part of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, became effective and at the time each incorporated document was filed with the Commission is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement;" the prospectus relating to the Shares, in the form in which it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement, including any prospectus supplement thereto, is hereinafter called the "Prospectus"; any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or
2
Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and any reference to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Shares in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof, including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing;
(b)

(c)
The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable filing date as to the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading, and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Shares through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Shares;
(d)
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries listed on Appendix A hereto, which Appendix contains an accurate and complete list of those subsidiaries of the Company that constitute "significant subsidiaries" of the Company within the meaning of Regulation S-X under the Act as of the date of this Agreement (each a "Significant Subsidiary," and collectively, the "Significant Subsidiaries"), has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any
3
material change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development that could be reasonably expected to cause a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus;

(h)
The issue and sale of the Shares and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of each of the Delayed Delivery Contracts, this Agreement and any Pricing Agreement and each Additional Shares Option, if any, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches and violations, that, individually or in the aggregate, do not have a material adverse effect and are not reasonably expected to have a prospective material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Shares or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Pricing Agreement or any Additional Shares Option or any Delayed Delivery Contract except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Time of Delivery, obtained under the Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state

3.
Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Shares and authorization by the Representatives of the release of such Firm Shares, the several Underwriters propose to offer such Firm Shares for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Shares that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "Additional Shares Option") to purchase at their election up to the number of Optional Shares set forth in such Pricing Agreement, on the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Shares in excess of the number of Firm Shares. Any such election to purchase Optional Shares may be exercised only by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Shares to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Shares are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of
5
Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement.
The number of Optional Shares to be added to the number of Firm Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Shares shall be, in each case, the number of Optional Shares which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the number of Optional Shares to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Shares which the number of Firm Shares to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares. The total number of Designated Shares to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate number of the Optional Shares which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
The Company may specify in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Shares that the Underwriters are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Designated Shares from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts (herein called "Delayed Delivery Contracts"), substantially in the form of Annex III attached hereto but with such changes therein as the Representatives and the Company may authorize or approve. If so specified, the Underwriters will endeavor to make such arrangements, and as compensation therefor the Company will pay to the Representatives, for the accounts of the Underwriters, at the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof), such commission, if any, as may be set forth in such Pricing Agreement. Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, are to be with investors of the types described in the Prospectus and subject to other conditions therein set forth. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of any Delayed Delivery Contracts.
The aggregate number of Contract Shares to be deducted from the aggregate number of Designated Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Shares shall be, in each case, the number of Contract Shares which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the amount of Contract Shares to be so deducted shall be, in each case, that proportion of Contract Shares which the number of Designated Shares to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate number of the Designated Shares (rounded as the Representatives may determine). The number of Underwriters' Shares to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Designated Shares set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement less the number of the Contract Shares. The Company will deliver to the Representatives not later than 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Time of Delivery specified in the applicable Pricing Agreement (or such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing) a written notice setting forth the aggregate number of Contract Shares.
4.
Delivery of the Firm Shares and the Optional Shares, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, shall be made through the facilities of the Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct. Any Designated Shares issued in definitive form shall be made in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company. Regardless of the method of delivery, any Designated Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by the method specified in such Pricing Agreement, (i) with respect to the Firm Shares, all at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such
6
other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "First Time of Delivery" and (ii) with respect to the Optional Shares, if any, on the time and date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Shares, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date, if not the First Time of Delivery, herein called the "Second Time of Delivery." Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery." "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
Concurrently with the delivery of and payment for the Underwriters' Shares, the Company will deliver to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters funds payable to the order of the party designated, and in the method specified, in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Shares in the amount of any compensation payable by the Company to the Underwriters in respect of any Delayed Delivery Contracts as provided in Section 3 hereof and the Pricing Agreement relating to such Shares.
5.
The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Shares:
(a)
To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Shares in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Shares or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Shares and prior to the Time of Delivery for such Shares which amendment or supplement shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Shares promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Shares, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Shares, of the suspension of the qualification of such Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Shares or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal;

(f)
If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement, and the Company shall at the time of filing either pay to the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Act;
(g)
Upon request of any Underwriter, to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to such Underwriter an electronic version of the Company's trademarks, servicemarks and corporate logo for use on the website, if any, operated by such Underwriter for the purpose of facilitating the on-line offering of the Shares (the "License"); provided, however, that the License shall be used solely for the purpose described above, is granted without any fee and may not be assigned or transferred; and

F. Dean Copeland, General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
9
(i)
The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
(ii)
The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
(iii)
The Company is qualified to do business, and is in good standing, as a foreign corporation under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the business conducted by it requires such qualification or, if not so qualified and in good standing in any such jurisdiction, such failure to be so qualified and in good standing, as of the date of the opinion will not have a material adverse effect and would not be reasonably expected to cause a prospective material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
(iv)
Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized, and is subsisting and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each such subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
(v)
To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
(vi)
This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(vii)
The Designated Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; and the Designated Shares conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus as amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Shares;
(viii)
In the event any of the Designated Shares are to be purchased pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract Shares have been duly authorized, and when issued and delivered pursuant to the Delayed Delivery Contracts and paid for in accordance with the Delayed Delivery Contracts will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; and the Contract Shares conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Registration Statement and Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Shares;
(ix)
The issue and sale of the Designated Shares and the compliance by the Company with each of the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, any Additional Shares Options, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares and the
10
consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches and violations, that do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect and are not reasonably expected to have a prospective material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties;
(x)
No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Shares or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement or any of such Delayed Delivery Contracts or any Additional Shares Options, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Shares by the Underwriters;
(xi)
The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and he has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading;
(xii)
The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Shares (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and
(xiii)
In the event any of the Designated Shares are to be purchased pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, each of such Delayed Delivery Contracts has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming such Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the purchaser named therein, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (1) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally, and (2) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
11
In addition, such counsel shall state that he has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of such Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and he shall state that he does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Georgia, the State of Tennessee or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent he deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of Alston & Bird LLP or other counsel of good standing whom he believes to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters;
(d)
Alston & Bird LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
(i)
The Designated Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement, the Designated Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; and the Designated Shares conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, each as amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Shares;
(ii)
In the event any of the Designated Shares are to be purchased pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, each of the Delayed Delivery Contracts has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of any Delayed Delivery Contract by the purchaser named therein, such Contract will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
12
In addition, such counsel shall state that they have no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of such Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel shall state that they do not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;
(e)
On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Shares and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the most recent report filed with the Commission containing financial statements and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, if the date of such report is later than such effective date, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
(f)
(i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or government action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any material change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
13
(g)
On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock; provided, however, that clause (ii) of this Section 7(g) shall not include a public announcement by any such organization confirming its previous public announcement that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;
(h)
On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension in trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market on which the securities of the Company are currently traded; (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States; (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by Federal or New York State authorities; or (v) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States, or any change in financial markets or any other calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
(i)
The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Shares a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of each Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to each Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request;
(j)
The Company shall have obtained and delivered to the Underwriters executed copies of an agreement, substantially in the form of Annex IV hereto, from each person listed in Schedule III of the applicable Pricing Agreement, and

8.
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
14
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Shares through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Shares; and provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact such Underwriter sold Shares to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the Act if the Company has previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus which was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented).
(b)
Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of any Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution is or is reasonably expected to be sought hereunder (whether or not the
15
indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Shares on the other from the offering of the Designated Shares to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Shares on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Shares in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Shares and not joint.
(e)
The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
16
9.
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Shares or Optional Shares which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Shares or Optional Shares, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Shares or Optional Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Firm Shares or Optional Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Shares or Optional Shares, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Shares or Optional Shares, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Firm Shares or Optional Shares for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Shares.
(b)
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10.
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any
17
controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
11.
If any Pricing Agreement or Additional Shares Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Shares or Optional Shares covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Shares, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Shares except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.
12.
In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Shares shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement; Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
13.
This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
14.
Time shall be of the essence for each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
15.
This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
18
16.
This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
17.
The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.

Each reference to the Representatives herein and in the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement so incorporated by reference shall be deemed to refer to you.

ANNEX II
Pursuant to Section 7(e) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants named therein shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
(i)
They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;
(ii)
In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules audited (and, if applicable, prospective financial statements and/or pro forma financial information examined) by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, prospective financial statements and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives");
(iii)
The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for five such fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
(iv)
On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A)
the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder or are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(B)
any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(C)
the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) above and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and referred to in Clause (B) above were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(D)
any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
(E)
as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net assets or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(F)
for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in Clause (E) above there were any decreases in consolidated net revenues or any material decrease in operating profit or any material decrease in the total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(v)
In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in
documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
All references in this Annex II to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Pricing Agreement for purposes of such letter and to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) in relation to the applicable Designated Shares for purposes of the letter delivered at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Re:

Ladies and Gentlemen:
The undersigned understands that you, as representatives (the "Representatives"), have entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") on behalf of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I to such agreement (collectively, the "Underwriters"), with UnumProvident Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), for a public offering of the Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company (the "Shares") pursuant to two Registration Statements on Form S-3 (333-43808 and 333-100953) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

In consideration of the agreement by the Underwriters to offer and sell the Shares, and of other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned agrees that, during the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement and continuing to and including the date 90
days after the date of the Pricing Agreement, the undersigned will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, hedge, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of, except as provided hereunder, any Common Stock or any securities of the Company that are substantially similar to the Common Stock, or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of Common Stock or any substantially similar securities, or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, any shares of Common Stock or any substantially similar securities, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, owned directly by the undersigned (including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which the undersigned has beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the SEC (collectively the "Undersigned's Shares").
The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the Undersigned's Shares even if such Shares would be disposed of by someone other than the undersigned.

The undersigned now has, and, except as contemplated by clause (i), (ii), or (iii) above, for the duration of this Lock-Up Agreement will have, good and marketable title to the Undersigned's Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims whatsoever. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the Undersigned's Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
From time to time UnumProvident Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its units (the "Units") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Firm Units" and together with any Optional Units, as defined below, the "Designated Units"), less the number of Designated Units covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, as provided in Section 3 hereof and as may be specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, any Designated Units to be covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts being herein sometimes referred to as "Contract Units" and the Designated Units to be purchased by the Underwriters (after giving effect to the deduction, if any, for Contract Units) being herein sometimes referred to as "Underwriters' Units").
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Units shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the purchase contract agreement (the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), the indenture (the "Indenture"), the purchase contracts (the "Purchase Contracts"), the pledge agreement (the "Pledge Agreement") and the remarketing agreement (the "Remarketing Agreement"), each as identified in such Pricing Agreement.
1.
Particular sales of Designated Units may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Units, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Units in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Units or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Units. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Units and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Units shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Units specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement with respect to Designated Units shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex I and shall specify the
names of the Underwriters of such Designated Units, the names of the Representatives, if any, of such Underwriters, the aggregate number of Firm Units and the maximum number of Optional Units, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriter with respect thereto, the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Units, whether any of such Designated Units shall be covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined in Section 3 hereof), the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Units, the nature of the funds to be delivered by the Underwriters, the initial public offering price or the manner of determining such price, if any, the terms of the debt securities ("Underlying Notes") and the Purchase Contracts of which the Designated Units shall initially consist, interest rates, if any, and maturity of the Underlying Notes, whether such Units or any of the securities of which the Designated Units shall consist will be convertible at the option of the holder thereof, any settlement rates or price(s), whether any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted). The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
(a)
Two registration statements on Form S-3 (No. 333-43808 and No. 333-100953), including a prospectus pursuant to Rule 429 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in respect of the Units, as well as certain other securities of the Company, preferred securities of UnumProvident Financing Trust II and UnumProvident Financing Trust III (collectively, the "Trusts") and guarantees by the Company with respect to the preferred securities of the Trusts, have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statements and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters and, excluding exhibits to such registration statements, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectuses contained therein, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement, if any, increasing the size of the offering (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Act, which became effective upon filing, no other document with respect to such registration statements or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, each in the form heretofore delivered to the Representatives); such prospectus included for use in connection with the Units pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act meets the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder for use of such prospectus in connection with the Units; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of either of such registration statements, any post-effective amendment thereto, or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission.

3.
Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Units and authorization by the Representatives of the release of such Firm Units, the several Underwriters propose to offer such Firm Units for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Units that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "Additional Shares Option") to purchase at their election up to the number of Optional Units set forth in such Pricing Agreement, on the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Units in excess of the number of Firm Units. Any such election to purchase Optional Units may be exercised only by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Units to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Units are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement.
The number of Optional Units to be added to the number of Firm Units to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Units shall be, in each case, the number of Optional Units which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the number of Optional Units to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Units which the number of Firm Units to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate number of Firm Units. The total number of Designated Units to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Units set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate number of the Optional Units which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
The Company may specify in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Units that the Underwriters are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Designated Units from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts (herein called "Delayed Delivery Contracts"), substantially in the form of Annex III attached hereto but with such changes therein as the Representatives and the Company may authorize or approve. If so specified, the Underwriters will endeavor to make such arrangements, and as compensation therefor the Company will pay to the Representatives, for the accounts of the Underwriters, at the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof), such commission, if any, as may be set forth in such Pricing Agreement. Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, are to be with investors of the types described in the Prospectus and subject to other conditions therein set forth. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of any Delayed Delivery Contracts.
The aggregate number of Contract Units to be deducted from the aggregate number of Designated Units to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Units shall be, in each case, the number of Contract Units which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the amount of Contract Units to be so deducted shall be, in each case, that proportion of Contract Units which the number of Designated Units to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate number of the Designated Units (rounded as the Representatives may determine). The number of Underwriters' Units to be purchased by
7
all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Designated Units set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement less the number of the Contract Units. The Company will deliver to the Representatives not later than 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Time of Delivery specified in the applicable Pricing Agreement (or such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing) a written notice setting forth the aggregate number of Contract Units.
4.
Delivery of the Firm Units and the Optional Units, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, shall be made through the facilities of the Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct. Any Designated Units issued in definitive form shall be made in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company. Regardless of the method of delivery, any Designated Units to be purchased by the Underwriters pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by the method specified in such Pricing Agreement, (i) with respect to the Firm Units, all at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "First Time of Delivery" and (ii) with respect to the Optional Units, if any, on the time and date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Units, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date, if not the First Time of Delivery, herein called the "Second Time of Delivery." Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery." "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
Concurrently with the delivery of and payment for the Underwriters' Units, the Company will deliver to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters funds payable to the order of the party designated, and in the method specified, in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Units in the amount of any compensation payable by the Company to the Underwriters in respect of any Delayed Delivery Contracts as provided in Section 3 hereof and the Pricing Agreement relating to such Units.

Each of the Designated Units, the Contract Units, the Purchase Contracts, the Underlying Shares, the Underlying Notes, the Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement conforms, and the Remarketing Agreement will conform, in all
14
material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, each as amended or supplemented with respect to the Designated Units;

Each of the Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Pledge Agreement, the Remarketing Agreement and the Purchase Contracts has been duly authorized by the Company and each of the Indenture, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
(iii)
Under the New York UCC, the Pledge Agreement creates, as collateral security for the performance when due by the holders from time to time of the Designated Units of their respective obligations under the Purchase Contracts, a valid security interest (as that term is defined in the New York UCC) in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company in the right, title and interest of such holders in all of the Pledged Securities that constitute "securities" (as that term is defined in Section 8-102(a)(15) of the New York UCC); and in the case of such Pledged Securities that constitute "securities" (as defined in the New York UCC), such security interest shall be perfected upon delivery of such certificates (indorsed in blank) to the Collateral Agent in the State of New York and, assuming that neither the Collateral Agent nor the Company has notice of an adverse claim with respect to such Pledged Securities, the Collateral Agent will acquire a security interest in the Pledged Securities free of any adverse claim (as that term is defined in the New York UCC); in the case of Pledged Securities that are credited by a securities intermediary (as defined in the New York UCC) to a securities account (as defined in the New York UCC) in the name of the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall have a perfected security interest in all security entitlements (as defined in the New York UCC) relating to such Pledged Securities;
(iv)
The issuance of the Designated Units has been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement, the Designated Units will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Purchase Contract Agreement and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the stockholders of the Company have no preemptive or similar rights with respect to such Designated Units;
(v)
In the event any of the Designated Units are to be purchased pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, the issuance of the Contract Units has been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement and delivered to and paid for in accordance with Delayed Delivery Contracts, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Purchase Contract Agreement and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect
15
and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the stockholders of the Company have no preemptive or similar rights with respect to such Contract Units;

(vii)
The issuance of the Underlying Shares has been duly and validly authorized and reserved for issuance and, when issued in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Contracts, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; the Underlying Shares have been reserved for issuance; and the stockholders of the Company have no preemptive or similar rights with respect to such Underlying Shares;
(viii)
The discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Units, based upon United States federal income tax law; and
(ix)
In the event any of the Designated Units are to be purchased pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, each of the Delayed Delivery Contracts has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of any Delayed Delivery Contract by the purchaser named therein, such Contract will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
In addition, such counsel shall state that they have no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of such Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of
16
Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact, in each case, solely with respect to information of or about the Company, necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel shall state that they do not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;
(e)

(f)
(i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or government action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any material change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Units on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
(g)
On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock; provided, however, that clause (ii) of this Section 7(g) shall not include a public announcement by any such organization confirming its previous public announcement that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;
(h)
On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Units there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension in trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market on which the securities of the Company are currently traded; (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States; (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities

(i)
The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Units a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of each Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to each Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request;

8.
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Units through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Units; and provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact such Underwriter sold Units to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the Act if the Company has previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus which was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented).
18
(b)
Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of any Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Units, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution is or is reasonably expected to be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Units on the other from the offering of the Designated Units to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but
19
also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Units on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Units underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Units in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Units and not joint.
(e)
The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9.
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Units or Optional Units which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Units or Optional Units, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Units on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Units or Optional Units, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Firm Units or Optional Units on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Units or Optional Units, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Units or Optional Units, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Firm Units or Optional Units for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Units.
20
(b)
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Units and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate number of Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Units or Optional Units, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Units shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10.
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Units.
11.
If any Pricing Agreement or Additional Shares Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Units or Optional Units covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Units are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Units, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Units except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.
12.

ANNEX II
Pursuant to Section 7(e) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants named therein shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
(i)
They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;
(ii)
In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules audited (and, if applicable, prospective financial statements and/or pro forma financial information examined) by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, prospective financial statements and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives");
(iii)
The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for five such fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
(iv)
On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A)
the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder or are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(B)
any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(C)
the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) above and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and referred to in Clause (B) above were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(D)
any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
(E)
as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net assets or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(F)
for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in Clause (E) above there were any decreases in consolidated net revenues or any material decrease in operating profit or any material decrease in the total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(v)
In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in
documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
All references in this Annex II to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Pricing Agreement for purposes of such letter and to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) in relation to the applicable Designated Units for purposes of the letter delivered at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Units.

[FORM OF REVERSE]
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its "6.00% Senior Notes due 2008" (herein sometimes referred to as the "Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000
(which amount may be increased by up to $75,000,000 in the event the Over-Allotment Option is exercised), issued and to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 9, 2001 (the "Base Indenture"), duly executed and delivered between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and a Fourth
Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 7, 2003, between the Company and the Trustee (such Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof except that an interest in a Note held as part of a Normal Unit represents an ownership interest of th, or 2.5%, of a Note in aggregate principal amount of $1,000 and will therefore correspond to the stated amount of $25 per Normal Unit. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series so issued are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

A payment on any Note or Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, which is paid on any Payment Date shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Agent from the Collateral Agent as provided by the terms of the Pledge Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Units Certificates), of which such Note or the appropriate Treasury Consideration is a part, is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date.
(b)
Each Normal Units Certificate evidencing Notes delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Normal Units Certificate shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and rights to accrue interest, which were carried by the Notes underlying such other Normal Units Certificate.
(c)
In the case of any Normal Unit, with respect to which Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date, or with respect to which Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on a Merger Early Settlement Date, or with respect to which Cash Settlement is effected on the Business Day immediately preceding

the Stock Purchase Date, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution is effected, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, payments on the Note or the appropriate Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, underlying such Normal Unit otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement, Cash Settlement or Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, and such payments shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Unit Certificates) was registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Normal Unit with respect to which Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution has been effected, payments on the related Notes or payments on the appropriate Treasury Consideration that would otherwise be payable after the applicable Settlement Date or after such Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such Normal Unit;

SECTION 4.2
Notice and Voting.
Under and subject to the terms of the Pledge Agreement and this Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of Normal Units a notice prepared by the Company at the Company's expense (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes underlying their Normal Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of any Holder of Normal Units on such record date, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request, the maximum number of Pledged Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Normal Unit, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Note underlying such Normal Unit.

The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Notes, and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of a Normal Unit to purchase the Common Stock under the Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Normal Unit.

The Company may cause to be made in any Normal Unit Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Treasury Portfolio for Notes as collateral.
Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption after the successful remarketing of the Notes, the Redemption Price will be payable in cash to the holders of the Notes.

THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS; THE REMARKETING
SECTION 5.1
Purchase of Common Stock.
(a)
Each Purchase Contract shall, unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred prior to the Stock Purchase Date, obligate the Holder of the related Unit to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to,
(i)
if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $13.27 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.8843 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract,
(ii)
if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price, but is greater than $10.875, the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value, and
(iii)
if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $10.875, 2.2989 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract,

(b)
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued by the Company with respect to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Stock Purchase Date. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable with respect to such payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, the Holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash as provided in Section 5.12.
(c)
The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date or, in the event of a Cash Merger, the Cash Merger Date.

provided
that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Unit under the Purchase Contract may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. Each Holder of a Unit, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.4 and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect of the Pledged Notes, the Pledged Treasury Consideration or the Pledged Treasury Securities to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
(e)
Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee) under the terms of this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement, and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying the Certificate so transferred and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.

an Early Settlement Date or Merger Early Settlement Date or on the Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, as the case may be, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution or an establishment or re-establishment of a Normal Unit has been effected, Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement Date, or Merger Early Settlement Date, Collateral Substitution or such establishment or re-establishment with respect to such Purchase Contract shall not be payable.

Subject to the provisions of Section 5.8, in the event (x) of any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, or (y) subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(h) below, that (i) a default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the payment of principal, interest or any other monetary amounts due and payable on any Senior Indebtedness and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Senior Indebtedness (and the Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), or (ii) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness shall have been accelerated because of a default in respect of such Senior Indebtedness (and the Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), then:
(i)
the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive, in the case of clause (x) above, payment in full of all amounts due or to become due upon all Senior Indebtedness and, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (y) above, payment of all amounts due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the Units are entitled to receive any Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units;
(ii)
any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of any of the Units would be entitled except for the provisions

(iii)
in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units, shall be received by the Agent or the Holders of any of the Units when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Sections 5.2(e) through (q), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
(g)
For purposes of Sections 5.2(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding;
provided
that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior
43
Table of Contents
Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment.
(h)
Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Senior Indebtedness, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Sections 5.2(e) through (g) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, and (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review.
(i)
Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Sections 5.2(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Sections 5.2(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
(j)
Nothing contained in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which, subject to the occurrence of a Termination Event as described in Section 5.2(b) and the Company's right
44
Table of Contents
pursuant to Section 5.3 to defer Contract Adjustment Payments, is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under these Sections 5.2(e) through (q), of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
(k)
Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in these Sections 5.2(e) through (q), the Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to these Sections 5.2(e) through (q).
(l)
The Agent shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Sections 5.2(e) through (q), the Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Sections 5.2(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
(m)
Nothing contained in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments, except as provided in these Sections 5.2(e) through (q).

(n)
Each Holder of Units, by his acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Agent on his, her or its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Sections 5.2(e) through (q) and appoints the Agent his, her or its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes.
(o)
The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Agent in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.2(e) through (q) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Agent, unless and until the Agent shall have received written notice thereof mailed or delivered to a Responsible Officer of the Agent from the Company, any Holder, any paying agent or the holder or representative of any Senior Indebtedness;
provided
that, if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section 5.2(o), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date.
(p)
The Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section 5.2 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Agent of any of its rights as such holder.
(q)
No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.
(r)
Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof.
With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, (i) the duties and obligations of the Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Agent shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are
46

specifically set forth in this Agreement; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Agent; and (iv) the Agent shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders.
SECTION 5.3
Deferral of Contract Adjustment Payments.
(a)
The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer each such deferred Contract Adjustment Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Units, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 8.25% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, being referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section 5.3. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Settlement Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Purchase Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Holder's right to receive Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, will terminate.
(b)
In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date.
(c)
In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Stock Purchase Date, each Holder will receive on the Stock Purchase Date in lieu of a cash payment a number of shares of Common Stock (in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate) equal to (A) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder (net of any required tax withholding on such Deferred Contract Adjustment Payment,
47
Table of Contents
which shall be remitted to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction) divided by (B) the Applicable Market Value.
(d)
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued by the Company with respect to the payment of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments on the Stock Purchase Date. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable with respect to such payment of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, the Holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash as provided in Section 5.12.
(e)
In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments then, until the earlier of (x) the Termination Date or (y) the date on which the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Capital Stock other than:
(i)
repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of Capital Stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a share purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments;
(ii)
as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock;
(iii)
the purchase of fractional interests of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged;
(iv)
dividends or distributions in the Company's Capital Stock (or rights to acquire the Company's Capital Stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of the Company's Capital Stock in exchange for or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale of the Company's Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Capital Stock); or
(v)
redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a stockholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights pursuant thereto.

SECTION 5.4
Payment of Purchase Price; Remarketing.
(a)
Unless a Special Event Redemption, successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.4 or Termination Event has occurred, or a Holder of a Unit has settled the underlying Purchase Contract through an Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.9 or a Merger Early Settlement pursuant to Section 5.10, each Holder of a Normal Unit may pay in cash ("Cash Settlement") the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to a Purchase Contract if such Holder notifies the Agent by surrender of the Normal Unit Certificate and delivery of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto of its intention to make a Cash Settlement. Such notice shall be made on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. The Agent shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent of the receipt of such a notice from a Holder intending to make a Cash Settlement.
(i)
A Holder of a Normal Unit who has so notified the Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement is required to pay the Purchase Price to the Collateral Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer, in each case in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Company. Any cash received by the Collateral Agent will be paid to the Company on the Stock Purchase Date in settlement of the Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.
(ii)
If a Holder of a Normal Unit fails to notify the Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) above, the Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Notes pursuant to the remarketing as described in paragraph (b) below. If a Holder of a Normal Unit does notify the Agent as provided in paragraph (a)(i) above of its intention to pay the Purchase Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph (a)(i) above, such failure shall constitute an event of default; however, the Notes of such a Holder will not be remarketed but instead the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Notes, including but not limited to those rights specified in subsection (b)(iii) below.
(b)
(i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred, the Company shall engage, no later than 30 days prior to the Remarketing Date, a nationally recognized investment bank (the "Remarketing Agent") pursuant to a Remarketing Agreement
to be mutually agreed on by the Company, the Agent and the Remarketing Agent, but providing for remarketing procedures
49
Table of Contents
substantially as set forth below to sell the Notes of Holders of Normal Units, other than Holders that have elected not to participate in the remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in clause (iv) below, and holders of Separate Notes that have elected to participate in the remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement. On the seventh Business Day prior to the first day of each Remarketing Period, the Agent shall give Holders of Normal Units and holders of Separate Notes notice of the remarketing including the specific U.S. Treasury security or securities (including the CUSIP number and/or the principal terms of such Treasury security or securities) that must be delivered by Holders of Normal Units that elect not to participate in the remarketing and the deadline for such delivery. The Company or the Agent, at the Company's request, shall request not later than seven nor more than 15 calendar days prior to any Remarketing Period, that the Clearing Agency notify the Clearing Agency participants of such Remarketing Period. The Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the first day of such Remarketing Period, the Remarketing Agent and the Collateral Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of Normal Unit Holders to be remarketed. On the third Business Day preceding the first day of such Remarketing Period, no later than by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Custodial Agent will notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Notes to be remarketed. No later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of such Remarketing Period, the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver for remarketing to the Remarketing Agent all Notes to be remarketed. Upon receipt of such notice from the Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Remarketing Date (and any Subsequent Remarketing Date), use its commercially reasonable best efforts to sell such Notes on such date at an aggregate price equal to at least 100.25% of the Remarketing Value. The sale of the Notes will be settled on or prior to the third Business Day following the Remarketing Date or any Subsequent Remarketing Date on which the Notes were successfully remarketed. The Remarketing Agent will use the proceeds from a successful remarketing to purchase the appropriate U.S. Treasury securities (the "Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration") with the CUSIP numbers, if any, selected by the Remarketing Agent, described in clauses (i)(1) and (ii)(1) of the definition of Remarketing Value related to the Notes of Holders of Normal Units that were remarketed. On or prior to the third Business Day following the Remarketing Date or any Subsequent Remarketing Date on which the Notes are successfully remarketed, the Remarketing Agent shall deliver such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration to the Agent, which shall thereupon deliver such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration to the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will thereupon apply such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, to secure such Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts. In the event of a successful
50
Table of Contents
remarketing pursuant to this Section 5.4, the Remarketing Agent will deduct as a remarketing fee after allowing for the aggregate purchase price of the Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (.25%) of the Remarketing Value (the "Remarketing Fee"). The Remarketing Agent will remit (1) the portion of the proceeds from the remarketing attributable to the Separate Notes to the holders of Separate Notes that were remarketed and (2) the remaining portion of the proceeds, less those proceeds used to purchase the Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration, to the Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Normal Units that were remarketed, all determined on a pro rata basis, in each case, on or prior to the third Business Day following the Remarketing Date or any Subsequent Remarketing Date on which the Notes were successfully remarketed. Holders whose Notes are so remarketed will not otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith.
(ii)
If, in spite of using its commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to at least 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent will attempt to establish a Remarketing Rate meeting these requirements on each of the two immediately following Business Days. If the Remarketing Agent cannot establish a Remarketing Rate meeting these requirements on any day during a Remarketing Period, the remarketing in such Remarketing Period will be deemed to have failed (a "Failed Remarketing"). In the event of a Failed Remarketing with respect to the first Remarketing Period, the Remarketing Agent will undertake the procedures set forth in clause (i) above on each of the three Business Days in the second Remarketing Period. In the event of a Failed Remarketing in the second Remarketing Period, the Remarketing Agent will further attempt to establish such a Remarketing Rate on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. If, in spite of using its commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent fails to remarket the Notes underlying the Normal Units at a price equal to at least 100.25% of the Remarketing Value in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the "Last Failed Remarketing" will be deemed to have occurred. Each remarketing attempt that takes place in accordance with this Section 5.4 after the Remarketing Date is referred to herein as a "Subsequent Remarketing." Within three Business Days following the date of a Failed Remarketing or the Last Failed Remarketing, as the case may be, the Remarketing Agent shall return any Notes delivered to it to the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, as applicable. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, may exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Notes, including those actions specified in (b) (iii) below;
provided
that if upon the Last Failed
51
Table of Contents
Remarketing, the Collateral Agent exercises such rights for the benefit of the Company with respect to such Notes, any accumulated and unpaid interest on such Notes will become payable by the Company to the Agent for payment to the Holders of the Normal Units to which such Notes relate. Such payment will be made by the Company on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Agent. The Company will cause a notice of any Failed Remarketing and of the Last Failed Remarketing to be published on the fourth Business Day following each Failed Remarketing and the Last Failed Remarketing, as the case may be, in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in The City of New York, which shall be
The Wall Street Journal
, if such newspaper is then so published. The Company will also release this information by means of Bloomberg and Reuters newswire (or any successor or equivalent of such newswires).
(iii)
With respect to any Notes which constitute part of Normal Units which are subject to the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and Section 5.4 (e) below, may, among other things, (A) retain such Notes in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts or (B) sell such Notes in one or more public or private sales or otherwise.
(iv)
A Holder of Normal Units may elect not to participate in the remarketing and retain the Notes underlying such Units by notifying the Agent of such election and delivering the specific U.S. Treasury security or securities (including the CUSIP number and/or the principal terms of such security or securities) identified by the Agent (as having been based solely on the identification that the Remarketing Agent shall have advised the Agent) that constitute the U.S. Treasury securities described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Remarketing Value relating to the retained Notes (as if only such Notes were being remarketed) (the "Opt-out Treasury Consideration") to the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fourth Business Day prior to the first day of any Remarketing Period. Upon receipt thereof by the Agent, the Agent shall deliver such Opt-out Treasury Consideration to the Collateral Agent, which will, for the benefit of the Company, thereupon apply such Opt-out Treasury Consideration to secure such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts. On the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of a Remarketing Period, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver the Pledged Notes of such Holder to the Agent. Within three Business Days following the last day of such Remarketing Period, (A) if
52
Table of Contents
the remarketing was successful, the Agent shall distribute such Notes to the Holders thereof, and (B) if there was a Failed Remarketing on such date, the Agent will deliver such Notes to the Collateral Agent, which will, for the benefit of the Company, thereupon apply such Notes to secure such Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contract and return the Opt-out Treasury Consideration delivered by such Holders to such Holders. A Holder that does not so deliver the Opt-out Treasury Consideration or does not so notify the agent of its election not to participate in the remarketing pursuant to this clause (iv) shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the remarketing.
(c)
Upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying the Stripped Units and, in the event of a successful remarketing or a Special Event Redemption, the Pledged Treasury Consideration underlying the Normal Units on the Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price applicable to such Units, as payment for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement thereof without needing to receive any instructions from the Holders of such Units. In the event the payments in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities or the Pledged Treasury Consideration underlying a Unit is in excess of the Purchase Price of the Purchase Contract being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent will distribute such excess to the Agent for the benefit of the Holder of such Unit when received.
(d)
Any distribution to Holders of excess funds and interest described in Section 5.4 (b) and (c) above shall be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Holder or the holder of Separate Notes, as applicable, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to an account maintained in the United States specified by the Holder or the holder of Separate Notes, as applicable.
(e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Pledge Agreement, subject to Section 3.2 of the Pledge Agreement, the obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders (except to the extent paid by Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement) and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price.
(f)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Unit unless the Company shall have (i) received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder by such Holder in the manner herein set forth or (ii) become entitled to exercise its rights as a secured party under Section 5.4(b)(iii).

SECTION 5.5
Issuance of Shares of Common Stock.
Unless a Termination Event shall have occurred on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date or an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, on the Stock Purchase Date, upon the Company's receipt of payment in full of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holders pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article and subject to Section 5.6(b) or the Company's exercise of its rights as a secured party pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(iii), the Company shall issue and deposit with the Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates representing the newly issued shares of Common Stock, registered in the name of the Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which both a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Stock Purchase Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Contract Settlement Fund"), to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Agent on or after the Stock Purchase Date, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article V (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder) together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.12 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered, no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of such Certificate or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable.
SECTION 5.6
Adjustment of Settlement Rate.
(a)
Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc.
(1)
Stock Dividends
. In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator
54
Table of Contents
shall be the sum of such number of shares of Common Stock and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
(2)
Stock Purchase Rights
. In case the Company shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock (that are not available on an equivalent basis to Holders of the Units upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Units) entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
(3)
Stock Splits; Reverse Splits
. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business
55
Table of Contents
on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective.
(4)
Debt or Asset Distributions
. (i) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in paragraph (2) of this Section 5.6(a), shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in the next paragraph, or any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section 5.6(a)), the Settlement Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution filed with the Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (4) is applicable, paragraph (2) of this Section 5.6(a) shall not be applicable.
(ii) In the case of a Spin-Off, the Settlement Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by multiplying the Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock. Any adjustment to the settlement rate under this paragraph 4(ii) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (1) the tenth
56
Table of Contents
Trading Day following the effective date of the Spin-Off and (2) the date of the securities being offered in the Initial Public Offering of the Spin-Off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-Off.
(5)
Cash Distributions
. In case the Company shall, (i) by dividend (other than regular quarterly, semi-annual or annual cash dividends) or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.6(b) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this Section 5.6(a)) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (ii) the aggregate amount of any other distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash (other than regular quarterly, semi-annual or annual cash dividends) within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section 5.6(a) has been made and (iii) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value as of the date or expiration of the tender or exchange offer referred to below (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution filed with the Agent) of consideration payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer) by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of the distribution described in clause (i) above and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section 5.6(a) has been made, exceeds 12.5% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution times the number of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on the fifth Trading Day following such date for determination, the Settlement Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the combined amount distributed or payable in the transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph (5) and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date for determination and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. Such increase in the Settlement Rate shall be given effect retroactively as of the opening of business on the "ex date."
57
Table of Contents
(6)
Tender Offers
. In case (i) a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution filed with the Agent) that when combined together with (ii) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution filed with the Agent), as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer), of consideration payable in respect of any other tender or exchange offer, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section 5.6(a) or this paragraph (6) has been made and (iii) the aggregate amount of any distributions to all holders of the Common Stock made exclusively in cash (other than regular quarterly, semi-annual or annual cash dividends) within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section 5.6(a) or this paragraph (6) has been made, exceeds 12.5% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on the fifth Trading Day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Settlement Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Settlement Rate immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (excluding any tendered shares) on the fifth Trading Day following the date of the Expiration Time plus (y) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph (6) (assuming in the case of clause (i) the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock and (y) the
58
Table of Contents
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the fifth Trading Day following the date of the Expiration Time plus the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares"). Such increase in the Settlement Rate shall be given effect retroactively as of the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time.
(7)
Reclassification
. The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.6(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve (i) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this Section 5.6(a)), and (ii) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective," as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this Section 5.6(a)).
(8)
"
Current Market Price"
. The "Current Market Price" per share of Common Stock means (a) except as provided in clauses (b) through (e) of this paragraph (8), for purposes of paragraphs (2), (4), (5) and (6) of this Section 5.6(a), on any day the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the five consecutive Trading Days ending on the earlier of the day in question and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation, (b) for purposes of subclauses (A) and (B) of paragraph (5) of this Section 5.6(a), the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on the "ex date" with respect to the distribution requiring such computation, (c) for purposes of subclauses (A) and (B) of paragraph (6) of this Section 5.6(a), the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the five consecutive Trading Days immediately following the date of the Expiration Time, (d) in the case of any Spin-Off that is effected simultaneously with an Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-Off, the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day on which the initial price of the securities being distributed in the Spin-Off is determined, and (e) in
59
Table of Contents
the case of any other Spin-Off, the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the first 10 Trading Days after the effective date of such Spin-Off. For purposes of this paragraph and the last sentence of paragraph (6) of this Section 5.6(a), the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution.
(9)
Calculation of Adjustments
. All adjustments to the Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest ,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest ,000th of a share to the next lower ,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein;

provided
that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. If an adjustment is made to the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1) through (7) or (10) of this Section 5.6(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.1(a) will apply on the Stock Purchase Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1) through (7) or (10) of this Section 5.6(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately before such adjustment;
provided
that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1) through (7) or (10) of this Section 5.6(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate.
(10)
Increase of Settlement Rate
. The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of Capital Stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons.

(b)
Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event.
In the event of
(1)
any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation),
(2)
any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety,
(3)
any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition), or
(4)
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any such event, a "Reorganization Event"),
each share of Common Stock covered by each Purchase Contract forming part of a Unit immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be converted for purposes of the Purchase Contract into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Stock Purchase Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that (i) is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of shares of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates, and (ii) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-electing Share"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share of Common Stock by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares). On the Stock Purchase Date, the Settlement Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on the Stock Purchase Date of such securities, cash or other property.
61
Table of Contents
In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.6. Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
SECTION 5.7
Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events.
(a)
Whenever the Settlement Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall:
(i)
forthwith compute the Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.6 and prepare and transmit to the Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
(ii)
as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.6 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide a written notice to the Agent of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Settlement Rate.
(b)
The Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract, and the Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article.

SECTION 5.8
Termination Event; Notice.
The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of Holders to receive Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments and obligations of Holders to purchase shares of Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Normal Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Notes or the appropriate Treasury Consideration, as the case may be, forming a part of such Normal Units, and the Stripped Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Treasury Securities forming a part of such Stripped Units, in each case in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 of the Pledge Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Register.
SECTION 5.9
Early Settlement.
(a)
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, Purchase Contracts underlying Units having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("Early Settlement") on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. Holders of Stripped Units may only effect Early Settlement of the related Purchase Contracts in integral multiples of 40 Stripped Units, and if Treasury Consideration has been substituted for the Notes as a component in the Normal Units due to a successful remarketing of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.4 or the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, Purchase Contracts underlying such Normal Units may only be settled early in integral multiples of Normal Units such that the Treasury Consideration to be deposited and the Treasury Consideration to be released are in integral multiples of $1,000. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the related Units shall deliver such Certificate to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount (the "Early Settlement Amount") equal to (A) the product of (i) the Purchase Price multiplied by (ii) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any,
63
Table of Contents
payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts;
provided
that no payment shall be required pursuant to clause (B) of this sentence if the Company shall have elected to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments which would otherwise be payable on such Payment Date. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and subject to Section 5.2(d), no payment or adjustment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract on any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Purchase Contract or on account of any dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying any Unit at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, such day shall be the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Unit and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day.
(b)
Upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract by the Holder of the related Units, the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, 1.8843 shares of Common Stock on account of such Purchase Contract (the "Early Settlement Rate"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6. As promptly as practicable after Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, the Company shall issue and shall deliver to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12.
(c)
No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date the Company shall cause (i) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, and (ii) the related Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, in the case of Normal Units, or the related Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of Stripped Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or the Holder's designee.

No Early Settlement will be permitted under this Section 5.9 unless, at the time of delivery of the Election to Settle Early form or the time the Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective registration statement with respect to the shares of Common Stock to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a registration statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for either the Company or the Agent) under the Securities Act. If such a registration statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have in effect a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (B) provide a prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that the Agent may use in connection with such Early Settlement.

(b)
To exercise a Merger Early Settlement right, a Holder shall deliver to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date specified in the notice the Certificate(s) evidencing the Units with respect to which the Merger Early Settlement right is being exercised duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Early Settlement Amount less the amount of cash that otherwise would be deliverable by the Company or its successor upon settlement of the Purchase Contract in lieu of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.6(b) and as described in the notice to Holders (the "Merger Early Settlement Amount").
(c)
On the Merger Early Settlement Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) the net cash, securities and other property to be received by such exercising Holder, equal to the Settlement Rate as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6, in respect of the number of Purchase Contracts for which such Merger Early Settlement right was exercised, and (ii) the related Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, in the case of Normal Units, or Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of Stripped Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Corporate Trust Office for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. In the event a Merger Early Settlement right shall be exercised by a Holder in accordance with the terms hereof, all references herein to Stock Purchase Date shall be deemed to refer to such Merger Early Settlement Date.

SECTION 5.12
No Fractional Shares.
No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Stock Purchase Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one Purchase Contract shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Purchase Contracts on the applicable Settlement Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, the Company, through the Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional shares in an amount equal to the value of such fractional shares times the Applicable Market Value.

Table of Contents
(Form of Reverse of Normal Units Certificate)
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Normal Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. All defined terms used but not defined in this Certificate have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or a Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement with respect to the Unit of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $13.27 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.8843 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $10.875, the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $10.875, 2.2989 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date or, in the event of a Cash Merger, the Cash Merger Date.
The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of
A-7
Table of Contents
the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company.
A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock at the close of business on such day.
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement.
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, (ii) by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Consideration acquired from the proceeds of a remarketing of the related Pledged Notes underlying the Normal Units represented by this Normal Units Certificate as contemplated by Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, (iii) if the Holder has elected not to participate in the remarketing, by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Opt-out Treasury Consideration deposited by such Holder in respect of such Purchase Contract or (iv) if a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the successful remarketing of the Notes as contemplated by Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Consideration purchased by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder or become entitled to exercise its rights as a secured party in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. If, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Last Failed Remarketing the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, exercises its rights as a secured creditor with respect to the Pledged Notes related to this Normal Units Certificate, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Pledged Notes will become payable by the Company to the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate in the manner provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
Under and subject to the terms of the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes, but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of
A-8
Table of Contents
Normal Units a notice (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each such Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes constituting a part of such Holder's Normal Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of any Holder of Normal Units on such record date, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request the maximum number of Pledged Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Normal Unit, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Note evidenced by such Normal Unit.
The Normal Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Normal Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Normal Units Certificate will be registered and Normal Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Normal Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Normal Units Certificate, but the Company and the Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Holder of a Normal Unit may substitute for the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration securing its obligations under the related Purchase Contract Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such Pledged Treasury Securities secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Stripped Unit." A Holder that elects to substitute Treasury Securities for Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration, thereby creating Stripped Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Normal Unit remains in effect, such Normal Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Normal Units in respect of the Pledged Note or Pledged Treasury Consideration and Purchase Contract comprising such Normal Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Normal Unit.
A Holder of Stripped Units may reestablish Normal Units at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date by depositing with the Collateral Agent the Notes or the appropriate Treasury Consideration in exchange for the release of the Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.

Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Units Certificates) evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Normal Units Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date. The Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or such other office or agency designated as set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Normal Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing.

Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 8.25% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement.

The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive accumulated Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments and the obligations of the Holders to purchase shares of Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Normal Units Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement.

The obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and except to the extent paid by Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Unit unless the Company shall have (i) received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder by such Holder in the manner herein set forth or (ii) exercised its rights as a secured party under Section 5.4(b)(iii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement.

Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Treasury Security constituting part of each Stripped Unit evidenced hereby has been pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligations of the Holder under the Purchase Contract comprising a part of such Stripped Unit to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company. Prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under each Purchase Contract, such Purchase Contracts shall not entitle the Holders of Normal Units Certificates to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders, or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter or any other rights whatsoever as stockholder of the Company.
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on May 15, 2006 (the "Stock Purchase Date"), at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement with respect to the Stripped Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part, all as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof.

Pledged Treasury Securities pledged to secure the obligations of the Holder under such Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement.
The Company shall pay on each Payment Date in respect of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Stripped Unit evidenced hereby an amount (the "Contract Adjustment Payments") equal to 2.25% per year of the Stated Amount, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, subject to deferral at the option of the Company as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof (
provided

AGENT'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Stripped Units Certificates referred to in the within-mentioned Purchase Contract Agreement.

Table of Contents
(Form of Reverse of Stripped Units Certificate)
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Stripped Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. All defined terms used but not defined in this Certificate have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $25 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement with respect to the Unit of which such Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $13.27 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.8843 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $10.875, the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract equal to the Purchase Price divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $10.875, 2.2989 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date or in the event of a Cash Merger, the Cash Merger Date.
The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of
B-6
Table of Contents
the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company.
A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock at the close of business of such day.
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement.
In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement or (ii) by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying the Stripped Units represented by this Stripped Units Certificate.
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth.
The Stripped Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Stripped Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Stripped Units Certificate will be registered and Stripped Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Stripped Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Stripped Units Certificate, but the Company and the Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Holder of a Stripped Unit may substitute for the Pledged Treasury Securities securing its obligations under the related Purchase Contract Notes or the appropriate Treasury Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Unit for which such Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Normal Unit." A Holder that elects to substitute Notes or the appropriate Treasury Consideration for Pledged Treasury Securities, thereby reestablishing Normal Units, shall
B-7
Table of Contents
be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Unit in respect of the Pledged Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract comprising such Stripped Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Stripped Unit.
A Holder of Normal Units may establish Stripped Units at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date by depositing with the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of the Pledged Notes or the appropriate Pledged Treasury Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.
Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Stripped Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Stripped Units Certificates) evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered on the Stripped Units Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or such other office or agency designated as set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Stripped Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing.
The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer each such Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 8.25% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Stock Purchase Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date.
In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock
B-8
Table of Contents
Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date.
In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Stock Purchase Date, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate will receive on the Stock Purchase Date, in lieu of a cash payment, a number of shares of Common Stock (in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate) equal to (i) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate divided by (ii) the Applicable Market Value.
The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments) will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness in the manner and to the extent set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement.
In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) the date on which the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Capital Stock other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or agents or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its rights to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Capital Stock (or rights to acquire Capital Stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of any series of the Company's Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Capital Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a stockholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights pursuant thereto.
The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive
B-9
Table of Contents
accumulated Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, and the obligations of the Holders to purchase shares of Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two business days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Stripped Units Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement.
Upon registration of transfer of this Stripped Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Stripped Units Certificate and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by his acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
The Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Stripped Units evidenced hereby on his behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (
i.e.,
affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, irrevocably authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on such Holder's behalf as attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Treasury Securities underlying this Stripped Units Certificate pursuant to the Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities, to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. The obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and except to the extent paid by Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such payments and the Purchase Price.

Table of Contents
Each Holder of any Unit, and each Beneficial Owner thereof, by its acceptance thereof or of its interest therein, further agrees to treat (i) itself as the owner of the related Notes, Treasury Consideration or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, and (ii) the Notes as indebtedness of the Company in each case, for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.
Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by and deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
The Company, the Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Stripped Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Stripped Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving any Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Agent, such Affiliate, nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

In addition, after deducting as the remarketing fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (.25%) of the Remarketing Value, the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent the remaining portion of the proceeds, if any, for payment to such holders. If, despite using commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent advises the Custodial Agent in writing that there has been a Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Notes to the Custodial Agent for redelivery to the holders of such Separate Notes. For purposes of this Section 4.5(d), a "holder" of Separate Notes shall mean the Person in whose name such Separate Notes is registered on the books of the registrar for the Notes.
