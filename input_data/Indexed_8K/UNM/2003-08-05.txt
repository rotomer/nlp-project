EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
August 5, 2003
 
 
 
Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $98.5 million ($0.36 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2003, compared to net income of $97.7 million ($0.40 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2002. Included in net income are net realized after-tax investment losses of $17.3 million ($0.06 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2003 and $55.0 million ($0.23 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2002. Excluding the impact of the net realized investment losses, after-tax operating income for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $115.8 million ($0.42 per diluted common share) compared to $152.7 million ($0.63 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2002.
 
During the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued a total of 52,877,000 shares of common stock in a public offering. As a result, the average number of shares used to calculate the per diluted common share results increased from 243,772,924 for the second quarter of 2002 to 273,773,623 for the second quarter of 2003. The actual number of shares outstanding as of June 30, 2003 was 295,960,132 compared to 241,387,655 as of June 30, 2002.
 
A reconciliation to net income (loss) is as follows:
 
 
 
Thomas R. Watjen, UnumProvident's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The second quarter was an important quarter for UnumProvident with the successful completion of our capital raising plan in May and generally improving operating performance despite the challenging business environment. We are particularly pleased with our investment results this quarter which produced a significant decline in the amount of the net realized investment loss relative to recent quarters, a continued decline in the exposure to high-yield securities, a large increase in the net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio, as well as a decline in the amount of gross unrealized losses."
 
2003 Guidance
 
The Company continues to project its guidance for 2003 operating income, excluding the reserve increase recorded in the first quarter and net realized investment gains and losses, within a range of $1.70 to $1.80 per diluted common share. This guidance takes into account the impact of the Company's
 
financial restructuring plan, including the dilution resulting from its common stock offering, as well as the impact of the investment portfolio restructuring on future net investment income, the lower discount rates on new claim incurrals, and the Company's projection of a continued challenging claims and business environment. The Company continues its policy of not providing guidance on net realized investment gains and losses for 2003.
 
Results by Segment
 
The segment reported operating income before net realized investment gains and losses and income taxes ("operating income") of $109.8 million, compared to operating income of $160.9 million in the second quarter of 2002.
Income Protection
 
Within the segment, the group income protection line reported operating income of $48.3 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared to $85.0 million in the prior year second quarter. The lower earnings in the quarter relative to a year ago are primarily the result of a decline in net claim recoveries and higher claim incidence in the long-term income protection line of business, as well as a reduction in the discount rate used for 2003 claim incurrals. The trends in net claim recoveries and claim incidence were stable in the second quarter of 2003 relative to the first quarter of 2003.
 
Also within this segment, the individual income protection line of business reported operating income of $46.1 million, compared to operating income of $66.8 million in the second quarter of 2002. The decline in earnings was primarily the result of higher paid benefits and a reduction in the discount rate used for 2003 claim incurrals. In 2003, the Company began reporting separately the results of its recently issued individual income protection business and its closed block of individual income protection business. Operating income in the recently issued individual income protection business totaled $40.8 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared to $47.2 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating income in the closed block of individual income protection business totaled $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared to $19.6 million in the second quarter of 2002.
 
Also within this segment, the long-term care line, which includes the results of both the group and individual long-term care lines, reported operating income of $10.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2002. Finally, the disability services line of business reported operating income of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2002.
Premium income for the Income Protection segment increased 7.4 percent to $1,327.0 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $1,235.7 million in the second quarter of 2002. Within this segment, premium income for the group income protection line increased 8.7 percent to $794.5 million in the second quarter of 2003 from $731.2 million in the second quarter of 2002. Premium income for the individual income protection line increased 2.4 percent to $433.0 million in the second quarter of 2003 from $423.0 million in the second quarter of 2002. Within this line, premium income in the recently issued block of individual income protection increased 15.5 percent to $172.6 million in the second quarter of 2003 from $149.4 million in the second quarter of 2002. Premium income in the closed block of individual income protection declined 4.8 percent to $260.4 million in the second quarter of 2003 from $273.6 million in the second quarter of 2002. Finally within this segment, premium income for the long-term care line increased 22.1 percent to $99.5 million in the second quarter of 2003 from $81.5 million in the second quarter of 2002.
 
New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group long-term income protection products increased 21.2 percent to $120.7 million in the second quarter of 2003, from $99.6 million in the second quarter of 2002. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group short-term income protection products declined 11.4 percent to $44.3 million in the second quarter of 2003, from $50.0 million in the second quarter of 2002.

Premium persistency in the Company's long-term income protection block improved to 86.6 percent for the second quarter of 2003 compared to 85.7 percent in the second quarter of 2002. Persistency also improved in the Company's short-term income protection line of business to 85.4 percent in the second quarter of 2003 compared to 80.1 percent in the second quarter of 2002.
 
The segment reported operating income of $63.4 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $62.2 million in the second quarter of 2002. The improvement in results relative to the year ago quarter was primarily the result of improved experience in the group life and voluntary life and other lines of business, which more than offset lower income in the accidental death & dismemberment line of business.
