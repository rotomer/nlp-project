Thomas R. Watjen, UnumProvident's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Overall, the third quarter was a good quarter for the Company with results generally in line with expectations. Our net income this quarter grew 10.4 percent relative to the second quarter, while we reported flat earnings per share due to the impact of the additional shares outstanding from our capital raising effort earlier this year. Strong statutory earnings and capital growth, further favorable investment portfolio trends, and strong individual income protection results relative to the second quarter were significant highlights this quarter. Our group income protection results, however, continue to be below our expectations, with higher new claim incidence this quarter offsetting a higher level of net claim recoveries relative to the second quarter. "
Results by Segment
 
The segment reported operating income before net realized investment gains and losses and income taxes ("operating income") of $121.8 million, compared to operating income of $165.7 million in the third quarter of 2002.
Income Protection
 
Within the segment, the group income protection line reported operating income of $42.7 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared to $85.4 million in the prior year third quarter. The lower earnings in the quarter relative to a year ago are primarily the result of a decline in net claim recoveries and higher claim incidence in the long-term income protection line of business, as well as a reduction in the discount rate used for 2003 claim incurrals. Relative to the second quarter of 2003, earnings were lower due to higher claim incidence and higher operating expenses, which more than offset a higher level of net claim recoveries.
 
Also within this segment, the individual income protection line of business reported operating income of $64.3 million, compared to operating income of $68.0 million in the third quarter of 2002. The decline in earnings was primarily the result of higher paid benefits and a reduction in the discount rate used for 2003 claim incurrals. Relative to the second quarter of 2003, earnings improved due to a higher level of net claim recoveries. In 2003, the Company began reporting separately the results of its recently issued individual income protection business and its closed block of individual income protection business. Operating income in the recently issued individual income protection business totaled $45.1 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared to $48.9 million in the third quarter of 2002. Operating income in the closed block of individual income protection business totaled $19.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared to $19.1 million in the third quarter of 2002.
 
Also within this segment, the long-term care line, which includes the results of both the group and individual long-term care lines, reported operating income of $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2002. Finally, the disability services line of business reported operating income of $4.3 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2002.
 
Premium income for the Income Protection segment increased 7.1 percent to $1,336.5 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $1,247.8 million in the third quarter of 2002. Within this segment, premium income for the group income protection line increased 8.5 percent to $793.9 million in the third quarter of 2003 from $731.7 million in the third quarter of 2002. Premium income for the individual income protection line increased 2.2 percent to $438.7 million in the third quarter of 2003 from $429.3 million in the third quarter of 2002. Within this line, premium income in the recently issued block of individual income protection increased 12.8 percent to $176.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 from
 
 
$156.6 million in the third quarter of 2002. Premium income in the closed block of individual income protection declined 3.9 percent to $262.1 million in the third quarter of 2003 from $272.7 million in the third quarter of 2002. Finally within this segment, premium income for the long-term care line increased 19.7 percent to $103.9 million in the third quarter of 2003 from $86.8 million in the third quarter of 2002.
 
New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group long-term income protection products declined 3.6 percent to $64.1 million in the third quarter of 2003, from $66.5 million in the third quarter of 2002.

New annualized sales (paid for basis) for individual income protection declined 11.9 percent to $36.9 million in the third quarter of 2003 from $41.9 million in the third quarter of 2002.
 
Premium persistency in the Company's long-term income protection block improved to 86.6 percent for the first nine months of 2003 compared to 85.5 percent in the first nine months of 2002. Persistency also improved in the Company's short-term income protection line of business to 84.7 percent for the first nine months of 2003 compared to 81.0 percent in the first nine months of 2002.
 
The segment reported operating income of $67.1 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $61.4 million in the third quarter of 2002. The improvement in results relative to the year ago quarter was primarily the result of improved experience in the accidental death & dismemberment and voluntary life and other lines of business, which more than offset lower income in the group life line of business.

Corporate
,
 
During the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued a total of 52,877,000 shares of common stock and 23,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) in a public offering. As a result, the average number of shares used to calculate the per diluted common share results increased from 242,276,584 for the third quarter of 2002 to 298,707,338 for the third quarter of 2003. Because the average market price of the Company's common stock exceeded the threshold appreciation price of $13.27 during the quarter, the share count used to calculate quarterly net income per common share assuming dilution includes 2,480,537 shares related to the units. If the average market price of the Company's common stock is $16.00 for the fourth quarter of 2003, the share count used to calculate quarterly net income per common share assuming dilution for the fourth quarter of 2003 would include approximately 7.4 million shares related to the units. The actual number of shares outstanding as of September 30, 2003 was 296,061,937 compared to 241,504,002 as of September 30, 2002.
