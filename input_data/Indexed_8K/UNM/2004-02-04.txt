EXHIBIT
 
    99.1         UnumProvident Corporation press release dated February 4, 2004.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) today reported a net loss of $347.2 million ($1.18 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to net income of $102.2 million ($0.42 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2002. The loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting principle change was $208.0 million ($0.71 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to income of $98.7 million ($0.41 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Included in the loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting principle change is an after tax increase in group income protection reserves of $286.0 million, or $440.0 million before tax. In January 2004, the Company completed its annual review of claim reserves to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses. Approximately $300.0 million of the reserve strengthening reflects implementation of a lower discount rate for its group income protection claim reserves. The discount rate was lowered to reflect the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates and the Company's new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate. The Company's new discount rate management approach is intended to better reflect the current investment environment and position the Company to be more responsive with discounts rates on new incurred claims as changes to the investment environment emerge. Approximately
 
 
$140.0 million of the reserve increase relates to a strengthening of the morbidity assumptions to reflect the impact of the continuing jobless economic recovery on claim incidence and severity. Claim incidence in the second half of 2003 was 8.4 percent higher than the first half of the year and 5.8 percent above the second half of 2002. Claim incidence is expected to continue at an elevated level for several quarters as the early indications of a recovering economy are not yet reflected in improved consumer confidence or job creation. The reserve increase represents a 5.4 percent increase in total net group income protection reserves as of December 31, 2003, which were $8.2 billion prior to this increase. This increase has no impact on the statutory reserves, statutory surplus, or risk-based capital of the Company.
 
Also included in the loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting principle change are net realized investment losses of $36.4 million before tax and $23.9 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to $80.8 million before tax and $52.6 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Japanese operations and recognized an impairment loss of $1.2 million before tax and $0.8 million after tax on this held for sale asset. The Company also recognized from this transaction a tax benefit of $6.8 million, for a net after tax gain of $6.0 million. The transaction closed in January of 2004. The Company has also announced the sale of a portion of its Argentina operations, with an expected closing date of March 2004. The Argentina operations is accounted for as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2003, and in conjunction with that classification, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $13.5 million before tax and $11.3 million after tax.
 
Also during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Canadian branch and is expected to close the transaction during the first half of 2004. The Canadian branch is accounted for as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2003 and also meets the accounting criteria for being reported as a discontinued operation. In conjunction with the classification of the Canadian branch as an asset held for sale, the Company tested the goodwill related to the Canadian branch for impairment and determined that the balance of $190.9 million was impaired. The Company also recognized a loss of $9.3 million before tax and $6.0 million after tax to write down the value of bonds in the Canadian branch investment portfolio to market value. These two charges, $200.2 million before tax and $196.9 million after tax, are included in the loss from discontinued operations. In addition, the Canadian branch reported net income from discontinued operations of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 ($27.4 million on a before-tax basis), compared to $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Effective October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36),
Embedded Derivatives:
 
 
DIG Issue B36 addresses financial accounting and reporting for embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance contracts that incorporate credit risk exposure unrelated to the credit risk of the counterparty to the reinsurance contract and requires the bifurcation of any such derivative from the host reinsurance contract. The adoption of DIG Issue B36 resulted in an increase as of October 1, 2003 in fixed maturity securities of $61.3 million to record the fair value of the embedded derivatives and a $39.9 million cumulative effect of accounting principle change, net of $21.4 million in tax.
Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposure That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments.
 
Thomas R. Watjen, UnumProvident's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our fourth quarter reported results reflect our continuing efforts to position UnumProvident to deliver better, more consistent performance. While we still have work to do, in 2003 we made great progress in strengthening our balance sheet and focusing on businesses which should generate attractive long-term returns. Our operating performance in the quarter was generally in line with our expectations, with the one exception being our group income protection results which is an area of intense focus within our Company. The actions taken last year have resulted in record levels of capital and surplus and position us to benefit more quickly from an improving economy and an increase in interest rates."
 
Results by Segment
 
A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). In the following discussions of the Company's segment operating results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax, net realized investment gains and losses, results of discontinued operations, and cumulative effects of accounting principle changes. These are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company measures segment performance excluding realized investment gains and losses because management believes that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses.
 
Because the Canadian branch is now reported as discontinued operations, its results are not included in the current and prior period results in the segment information below.
 
 
The segment reported an operating loss of $355.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to operating income of $147.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Income Protection
 
Within the segment, the group income protection line reported an operating loss of $429.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to operating income of $80.5 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Included in the operating loss was the reserve strengthening of $440.0 million. Excluding this reserve strengthening, the lower earnings in the quarter relative to a year ago are primarily the result of higher claim incidence and a reduction in the discount rate used for 2003 claim incurrals in the long-term income protection line of business, as well as lower operating income in the Company's short-term income protection line of business. Relative to the third quarter of 2003, earnings were lower due to lower overall net investment income and higher operating expenses in the Company's United Kingdom and Japan operations, as well as lower results for the group short-term income protection line. The Company's benefit ratio in the group income protection line, excluding the reserve strengthening, was 92.9% in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to 92.8% in the third quarter of 2003, reflecting a reduction in the discount rate used for fourth quarter 2003 claim incurrals which offset relatively stable third quarter to fourth quarter of 2003 incidence and net claim recovery trends.
 
Also within this segment, the individual income protection line of business reported operating income of $53.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to operating income of $55.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.

In 2003, the Company began tracking separately the results of its recently issued individual income protection business and its closed block of individual income protection business. Operating income in the recently issued individual income protection business totaled $31.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to $36.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Operating income in the closed block of individual income protection business totaled $22.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to $18.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Premium income for the individual income protection line declined 7.8 percent to $359.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 from $390.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Included in the fourth quarter of 2003 results was a reinsurance transaction completed during the fourth quarter with an effective date of April 1, 2003, which reduced individual income protection premium income by approximately $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Finally within this segment, premium income for the long-term care line increased 15.0 percent to $106.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 from $92.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.

The segment reported operating income of $72.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to $86.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
