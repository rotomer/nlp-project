Annex V
Annex V
 
 
(a) The Company (i) shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Subscriber from any losses, damages, expenses or liabilities (""), arising out of actions or claims of third parties (excluding each Subscriber's subsidiaries and controlled affiliates) arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Confidential Private Offering Memorandum or in any amendment or supplement thereto or insofar as such Damages arise out of the omission or alleged omission from the Confidential Private Offering Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading, and (ii) shall reimburse each Subscriber for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Subscriber in investigating or defending any such actions or claims as such expenses are incurred; that the Company is not liable in any such case to the extent that any such Damages arise out of an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Confidential Private Offering Memorandum or in any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and
Damages
provided
 
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Subscriber expressly for inclusion in the Confidential Private Offering Memorandum or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(b) Each Subscriber shall, if a claim is to be made by such Subscriber against the Company under Section 11(a) hereof, promptly notify the Company and all other Subscribers in writing within 30 days after becoming aware of such claim. The omission to so notify the Company of the commencement of such action shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to any such Subscriber under Section 11(a) hereof to the extent the Company is not materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) as a result of such omission.
 
(c) The Company and the Subscribers agree that any payment made under Section 11(a) hereof shall be treated by the parties on their tax returns, to the extent permitted by law or regulation, as an adjustment to the original purchase price paid to the Company for the Units to which the payment relates.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) above in respect of any Damages (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Damages (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each of the Subscribers on the other from the offering of the Units to which such Damage (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Subscriber on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Damages (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company are the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Subscribers on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Subscribers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Subscribers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Damages (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Subscriber shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Units were purchased exceeds the amount of any damages which such Subscriber has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Subscribers for the Units in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchases and not joint.
 
 
(a) The term "" means all information about the Company and/or one or more of its affiliates and their respective businesses and the offer and sale of the Units, in each case, furnished to Subscribers or their Representatives (as defined below) by the Company or its Representatives, furnished before the Closing Date, whether oral or written, and in whatever form it is furnished, and all analyses, compilations, models, studies, summaries, notes, data and other documents and materials in whatever form produced or maintained, whether prepared by a Subscriber, its Representatives or others, that contain or reflect, or are generated from, any such information. Information shall not include, however, information which (i) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by a Subscriber or its Representatives or (ii) is or becomes available to a Subscriber on a nonconfidential basis from a source (other than the Company or its Representatives) that, to the best of such Subscriber's knowledge after due inquiry, is not prohibited from disclosing such Information to such Subscriber by legal, contractual, fiduciary or other obligation to the Company or any of its Representatives. The term "" means for purposes of this Section 12, as to any person, such person's affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, other representatives (including, without limitation, advisors, financial advisors and consultants, counsel, attorneys, actuarial advisors and accountants). The term "person" shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.

(b) Each Subscriber agrees: (i) to keep the Information confidential and not to, without the Company's prior written consent, disclose or reveal any Information in any manner whatsoever and (ii) not to use, and to cause its Representatives not to use, Information for any purpose other than in connection with its purchase or ownership of the Units; that a Subscriber may reveal the Information to its Representatives (a) who are actively and directly participating in advising such Subscriber with respect to its investment in the Units or who otherwise need to know the Information for the purpose of advising such Subscriber with respect to its investment in the Units, (b) who are informed by such Subscriber of the confidential nature of the Information and (c) who agree to act in accordance with this Section 12. The Subscriber will require its Representatives to observe the terms of this Section 12, and such Subscriber will be responsible for any breach of this Section 12 by any of its Representatives and each Subscriber agrees, at its sole expense, to take all reasonable measures (including, but not limited to, court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized use of the Information.
provided, however,
 
(c) In the event that the Subscriber or any of its Representatives is requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any Information or any other information concerning the Company or the purchase of Units, the Subscriber agrees that it will provide the Company with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable it to (i) seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, (ii) consult with the Subscriber with respect to the Company's taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process or (iii) in the Company's sole discretion, waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Section 12. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained before the Subscriber is required to produce the Information or the Company waives compliance with the terms hereof, the Subscriber shall furnish, at its sole expense, only that portion of the Information which, in the opinion of its counsel, is legally required to be disclosed. In any such event, the Subscriber will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that confidential treatment will be accorded the Information and any other information concerning the Company or the purchase of Units that is so disclosed.
 
(d) Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available at law or equity to the Company, it is further understood and agreed that the Company would be irreparably injured by a breach of this Section 12, that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any actual or threatened breach of this Section 12 by the Subscriber or any of its Representatives and that the Company and its affiliates shall (without proof of actual damages) be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance that may be available as a remedy, in addition to any other remedies that may be available in law or equity, if the Subscriber or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Section 12. In the event of litigation relating to this Section 12, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Subscriber or any of its Representatives have breached this Section 12, then the Subscriber shall reimburse the Company or the applicable affiliate for the costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such litigation.
 
 
With respect to communications regarding information that is not confidential "Information" (as defined above), the Company and each of the Subscribers:
 
(a) consent to public disclosure of the identity of the Subscribers, the Subscription Agreement and the Units in connection with the public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as well as substantially similar disclosures in any press release of the Company and any report or other filing of the Company made pursuant to the Exchange Act (the "");

(b) agree that this Agreement (including the Schedule and Annexes hereto), and any amendments to either may be publicly disclosed by the Company and that the term "Approved Public Disclosures" shall include the content of such documents;

(d) agree that, with respect to public disclosures by a Subscriber regarding its purchase of Units, each Subscriber will consult with and obtain the prior consent of the Company prior to any public disclosure by the Subscriber occurring prior to the Closing Date, it being understood that the Subscriber may make Approved Public Disclosures it deems necessary and appropriate without the consent of the Company; following the Closing Date such prior consultation shall not be required; and
 
(e) agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, each party to this agreement (and such person's employees, representatives, or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. Federal tax treatment and U.S. Federal tax structure of the transactions and arrangements discussed in these materials and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. For purposes of this provision, the "tax structure" includes only those facts that may be relevant to understanding the purported or claimed U.S. Federal income tax treatment of the relevant transaction or arrangement and, to eliminate any doubt, therefore does not include information revealing or tending of itself to reveal the identity of the Company or any other person that participates in any way in discussion or preparation of (or is identified in any way in) materials that may be provided (and, in each case, such person's affiliates, employees, representatives and other agents). This provision is intended to prevent any transaction or arrangement relating to these materials that is ultimately consummated from being treated as a "confidential transaction" within the meaning of Treas. Regs. 1.6011-4(b)(3) and (c)(3)(i)(B).
