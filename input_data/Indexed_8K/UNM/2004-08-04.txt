Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) announced today its results for the second quarter of 2004, which were highlighted by improved operating income in its group income protection line of business, the strongest level of statutory operating income in over three years, and operating income from continuing operations before net realized investment losses which exceeded consensus estimates. The second quarter results also include the accounting impact of the close of the sale of the Company's Canadian branch during the quarter, which was originally announced in the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
"We are generally pleased with our results this quarter and believe that the actions we've initiated over the past year to build financial strength and improve operating performance are having a favorable impact on results," said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. "Particularly encouraging is the improvement in our U.S. group income protection business, which continues to be a significant factor in our Company's overall profitability. It is clear that the steps we began taking last fall to improve the performance of this line of business are beginning to make a difference. As a result of these and other restructuring initiatives, our statutory operating earnings over the past four quarters have totaled $525 million, solid evidence of improved business fundamentals. While there is still more work
ahead, I am confident that through the continued outstanding efforts of our employees we will continue to make progress toward our long-term goals."
 
UnumProvident reported income from continuing operations of $75.0 million ($0.25 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $94.1 million ($0.34 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2003. Included in these results are net realized after tax investment losses of $55.9 million ($0.18 per diluted common share), compared to $17.3 million ($0.07 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2003. Excluding the net realized after tax investment losses, income from continuing operations was $130.9 million ($0.43 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $111.4 million ($0.41 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2003. The Company believes operating income or loss, a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes realized investment gains and losses, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in the business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business.
 
Net realized investment losses for the second quarter of 2004, which totaled $86.5 million on a before tax basis or $55.9 million on an after tax basis, include the impact from the adoption effective October 1, 2003 of the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36). Before tax net realized investment losses for the second quarter of 2004 include a net decrease in the fair value of DIG Issue B36 derivatives of $75.3 million.
 
With the closing on April 30, 2004 of the sale of the Company's Canadian branch, the Company reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $67.8 million ($0.23 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2004, compared to income of $4.4 million ($0.02 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2003. The net loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2004 includes after tax income, excluding the loss on the sale, of $3.1 million and an after tax loss on the sale of $70.9 million. As a part of the transaction, the Company retained a portion of the Canadian branch fixed maturity bond portfolio with a fair value as of April 30, 2004, of $732.9 million and a yield of 7.14 percent. The Company expects that these investments, which were primarily held in the Corporate segment during the second quarter, will be redeployed to its other lines of business in future quarters, enhancing the portfolio yield and net investment income for the other lines. Management believes that these assets are an important element of the economic value to the Company of this transaction. On a statutory basis of reporting, the Company recorded a gain of $250.6 million after tax on the sale of the Canadian branch.
Net income for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $7.2 million ($0.02 per diluted common share), compared to $98.5 million ($0.36 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Results by Segment
 
In the following discussions of the Company's segment operating results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax, net realized investment gains and losses, and results of discontinued operations.
 
The segment reported operating income of $90.8 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $98.5 million in the second quarter of 2003.
Income Protection
 
Within the segment, the group income protection line reported operating income of $49.4 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to $47.7 million in the prior year second quarter. The benefit ratio for the group income protection line improved to 89.4 percent from 90.7 percent one year ago. Paid incidence in the Company's group long-term income protection line was lower than the second quarter of 2003 and claim recovery experience was generally higher.
 
Also within this segment, the recently issued individual income protection line of business reported operating income of $24.6 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to operating income of $35.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. The lower results were primarily driven by higher operating expenses and lower net investment income. The benefit ratio in this line improved to 57.3 percent in the second quarter of 2004, compared to 62.1 percent in the second quarter of 2003, reflecting lower claim incidence trends and stable claim management results.
 
The long-term care line, which includes the results of both the group and individual long-term care lines, reported operating income of $12.7 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $10.6 million in the second quarter of 2003. Finally, the disability management services line of business reported operating income of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Premium income for the Income Protection segment increased 3.9 percent to $1,024.5 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $986.0 million in the second quarter of 2003. Within this segment, premium income for the group income protection line increased 3.2 percent to $786.4 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $762.2 million in the second quarter of 2003. Premium income for the recently issued individual income protection line increased 3.7 percent to $128.9 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $124.3 million in the second quarter of 2003. Finally, premium income for the
long-term care line increased 9.7 percent to $109.2 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $99.5 million in the second quarter of 2003.
 
New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group long-term income protection fully insured products declined 32.1 percent to $73.3 million in the second quarter of 2004, from $107.9 million in the second quarter of 2003. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group short-term income protection fully insured products declined 35.2 percent to $16.9 million in the second quarter of 2004, from $26.1 million in the second quarter of 2003. New annualized sales (paid for basis) for recently issued individual income protection declined 17.0 percent to $22.9 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2003. The decline in sales activity is primarily due to the Company's disciplined pricing strategy and the competitive market environment and to a lesser extent, to the adverse publicity surrounding the Company. The Company expects the lower rate of sales activity will continue as it places a higher emphasis on the profitability of its business.
 
Premium persistency in the Company's U.S. group long-term income protection block was 84.9 percent for the first half of 2004, compared to 87.2 percent for full year 2003. This decline is consistent with the Company's efforts to re-price portions of its in-force business in order to improve its profitability. Persistency in the Company's group short-term income protection line of business was 82.5 percent for the first half of 2004 compared to 84.5 percent for full year 2003.
 
The segment reported operating income of $58.6 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2003. The decline relative to the year ago quarter was driven by lower earnings in both the voluntary lines of business and accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D). Earnings in the group life line of business were generally flat relative to the year ago quarter.
Life and Accident
 
Premium income in this segment increased 2.2 percent to $496.2 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $485.5 million in the second quarter of 2003. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) in the group life line totaled $67.8 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $74.9 million in the second quarter of 2003. New annualized sales in the AD&D line of business totaled $3.6 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $5.3 million in the year ago quarter. New annualized sales in the brokerage voluntary life and other lines totaled $13.5 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Premium persistency in the Company's U.S. group life line of business was 84.1 percent for the first half of 2004 compared to 83.2 percent for full year 2003.
The segment reported operating income of $39.4 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $35.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. The benefit ratio for this segment improved to 55.2 percent in the second quarter of 2004 compared to 56.8 percent in the second quarter of 2003, reflecting the completion in 2003 of the exit of the under-performing group long-term income protection block within Colonial's operations. Premium income for this segment increased 7.2 percent to $184.0 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $171.7 million in the second quarter of 2003. New annualized sales in this segment declined 3.7 percent to $63.2 million in the second quarter of 2004, from $65.6 million in the second quarter of 2003.
Colonial
 
The segment reported operating income of $30.0 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2003. The improved results were primarily driven by the elimination of the amortization of the value of business acquired and deferred acquisition costs as of January 1, 2004, and lower expenses. Incidence trends remained relatively flat with the levels experienced in 2003 while recovery trends improved relative to the second quarter of 2003. Premium income for this segment declined 4.3 percent to $249.2 million from $260.4 million in the second quarter of 2003.
Individual Income Protection  Closed Block
 
The segment, which includes results from products no longer actively marketed, reported operating income of $10.5 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to income of $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2003.
Other
 
The segment which includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, and certain other corporate expenses, reported a loss of $30.7 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to a loss of $45.2 million in the second quarter of 2003. Included in the results for the second quarter of 2004 is a $9.4 million curtailment gain related to changes in the Company's retiree medical plan. The Company expects that net investment income in the Corporate segment will decline during the remainder of the year relative to the second quarter of 2004 as the assets retained from the sale of the Canadian branch and held in this segment are redeployed to other operating segments, thereby benefiting the net investment income and portfolio yields for these other operating segments.
Corporate
,
 
In May 2003, the Company issued a total of 52,877,000 shares of common stock and 23,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units in a public offering. As a result, the weighted average number of shares used to calculate the per diluted common share results increased from 273,773,623 for the second quarter of 2003 to 301,478,204 for the second quarter of 2004.
In May 2004, the Company issued 12,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units in a private offering for $300.0 million. The purchase contract element of these adjustable conversion-rate equity security units contributes to the number of weighted average common shares, assuming dilution, when the average market price of the Company's common stock is above the threshold appreciation price of $16.95 per share. Because the average market price of the Company's common stock during the period the units were outstanding was below this price, the shares issuable were excluded from the computation of per diluted common share results for the second quarter of 2004.
 
Book value per common share at June 30, 2004 was $21.01, compared to $26.08 at June 30, 2003.

2004 Offering
 
In May 2004, the Company issued 12,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) in a private offering for $300.0 million. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on March 15, 2007 and (b) a 1/40 or 2.5% ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2009 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $300.0 million and will issue between 17.7 million and 20.4 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common sharesassuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $16.95 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. The impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common sharesassuming dilution, including the 2003 unit offering (see "2003 Public Offerings" discussion following), at various quarterly average stock price levels is as follows:

In June 2004, the Company amended its postretirement medical plan and as a result of this amendment, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of $9.4 million before tax in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Also during the second quarter of 2004, the Company closed the sale of its Canadian operations and reported a loss of $113.0 million before tax and $70.9 million after tax on the sale of the branch. Assets transferred to the buyer included available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $1,099.4 million and a book value of $957.7 million. Liabilities transferred included reserves of $1,254.8 million. The Company retained a portion of the Canadian branch fixed maturity bond portfolio according to the terms of the transaction. The bonds retained had a fair value, at April 30, 2004, of $732.9 million and a yield of 7.14 percent. These investments, which will be redeployed to other lines of business during the remainder of the year, added approximately four basis points to the investment portfolio yield rate, at April 30, 2004, in the Company's continuing operations.

1
st
Quarter
 
In the first quarter of 2004, the Company restructured its individual income protection  closed block business wherein three of its insurance subsidiaries entered into reinsurance agreements to reinsure approximately 66.7 percent of potential future losses that occur above a specified retention limit. The individual income protection  closed block reserves in these three subsidiaries comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's overall retained risk in the closed block of individual income protection. The reinsurance agreements effectively provide approximately 60 percent reinsurance coverage for the Company's overall consolidated risk above the retention limit. The maximum risk limit for the reinsurer is approximately $783.0 million initially and grows to approximately $2.6 billion over time, after which any further losses will revert to the Company. These reinsurance transactions were effective as of April 1, 2004. The Company transferred cash equal to $521.6 million of reserves ceded in the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment plus an additional $185.8 million in cash for a before-tax prepaid cost of insurance which was deferred and will be amortized into earnings over the expected claim payment period covered under the Company's retention limit. The Company retained the higher yielding investments historically associated with these reserves and redeployed these investments to other lines of business.
 
In conjunction with the restructuring of the individual income protection  closed block business, effective January 1, 2004, the Company modified its reporting segments to include a separate segment for this business. The reporting, monitoring, and management of the closed block of individual income protection business as a discrete segment is consistent with the Company's financial restructuring and separation of this business from the lines of business which actively market new products. In the past, this business had been reported in the Income Protection segment. Prior to 2004, detailed separate financial metrics and models were unavailable to appropriately manage this block of business separately from the recently issued individual income protection block of business.
 
The change in the Company's reporting segments required the Company to perform, separately for the individual income protection  closed block business and individual income protection  recently issued business, impairment testing for goodwill and loss recognition testing for the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired. As required under GAAP, prior to the change in reporting segments, these tests were performed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. The testing indicated impairment of the individual income protection  closed block deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired, and goodwill balances of $282.2 million, $367.1 million, and $207.1 million, respectively. These impairment charges, $856.4 million before tax and $629.1 million after tax, are included in the net loss reported for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Also as part of the restructuring, the Company analyzed the reserve assumptions related to its individual income protection  closed block reserves as a stand-alone segment. Previously these reserves were analyzed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. Included in the analysis was a review of morbidity assumptions, primarily claim resolution rates, and claim reserve discount rate assumptions. Based upon this analysis, the Company lowered the claim reserve discount rate to reflect the segmentation of assets between the individual income protection  recently issued business and the individual income protection  closed block business, the change in the Company's investment portfolio yield rates during the first quarter of 2004, the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates, and the Company's desire to maintain the relationship between the claim reserve discount rate and the investment portfolio yield rate for the individual income protection  closed block at the Company's long-term objective. The segmentation of the investment portfolio was necessary to ensure appropriate matching of the duration of the assets and the related policy liabilities. Based on this analysis, in the first quarter of 2004 the Company increased its individual income protection  closed block claim reserves by $110.6 million before tax, or $71.9 million after tax, to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The first quarter 2004 change represented a 1.2 percent increase in total net individual income protection  closed block reserves as of March 31, 2004, which for continuing operations equaled $9.530 billion prior to this increase.

2003 Accounting Principle Changes
 
4th Quarter
 
Effective October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36), DIG Issue B36 addresses financial accounting and reporting for embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance contracts that incorporate credit risk exposure unrelated to the credit risk of the counterparty to the reinsurance contract and requires the bifurcation of any such derivative from the host reinsurance contract. The Company has two reinsurance contracts for which DIG Issue B36 is applicable. The adoption of DIG Issue B36 resulted in an increase in fixed maturity securities of $61.3 million to record the fair value of the embedded derivatives and a $39.9 million cumulative effect of accounting principle change, net of $21.4 million in tax.
Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposure That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments.
 
Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 (Interpretation 46), . Interpretation 46 expands upon ARB No. 51, , to address financial accounting and reporting for certain entities in which a controlling financial interest cannot be identified based on an evaluation of voting interests. Transition to the provisions of Interpretation 46 required the Company to consolidate four special purpose entities whose purposes are to support the Company's investment objectives. Prior to December 31, 2003, these entities were accounted for as fixed maturity securities in the available for sale portfolio and carried at fair value which was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. For these four entities, the adoption of Interpretation 46 had no impact on the fair value of total invested assets reported in the Company's consolidated statement of financial condition.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51
Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Adoption of Interpretation 46 also resulted in the de-consolidation of a trust that currently holds $300.0 million of junior subordinated debt securities of the Company and has issued a similar amount of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The impact of the de-consolidation was the elimination of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debt securities of the company included in the consolidated statement of financial condition and an increase of $300.0 million in long-term debt.
 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, , and selected the prospective method of adoption allowed under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, . The adoption decreased after tax results for 2003 approximately $0.6 million.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure
 
2003 Public Offerings
 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued a total of 52,877,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, related to a public offering. In addition, the Company issued a total of 23,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) related to a public offering. The Company received approximately $547.7 million in proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock and $557.8 million in proceeds from the sale of the units after deducting underwriting discounts. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on May 15, 2006 and (b) a 1/40, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2008 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $575.0 million and will issue between 43.3 million and 52.9 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common sharesassuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $13.27 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. See "2004 Offering" discussion preceding for the impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common shares-assuming dilution at various quarterly average stock price levels.

2003 Other Items
 
4th Quarter
 
Included in the fourth quarter of 2003 results is an after tax increase in group income protection reserves of $286.0 million, or $440.0 million before tax. In January 2004, the Company completed its annual review of claim reserves to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses. Approximately $300.0 million of the reserve strengthening reflects implementation of a lower discount rate for its group income protection claim reserves. The discount rate was lowered to reflect the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates and the Company's new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate. The Company's new discount rate management approach is intended to better reflect the current investment environment and position the Company to be more responsive with discounts rates on new incurred claims as changes to the investment environment emerge. Approximately $140.0 million of the reserve increase relates to a strengthening of the morbidity assumptions to reflect the impact of the continuing weak economic cycle on claim incidence and severity. Claim incidence in the second half of 2003 was 8 percent higher than the first half of the year and 5 percent above the second half of 2002. Increased claim incidence is expected to continue at an elevated level for several quarters as the early indications of a recovering economy are not yet reflected in improved consumer confidence or job creation. The reserve increase represents a 5.4 percent increase in total net group income protection reserves as of December 31, 2003, which were $8.186 billion prior to this increase.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Canadian branch and expects the transaction to close during the first half of 2004. The Canadian branch is accounted for as "held for sale" at December 31, 2003 and also meets the accounting criteria for being reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with the classification of the Canadian branch as held for sale, the Company tested the goodwill related to the Canadian branch for impairment and determined that the balance of $190.9 million was impaired. The Company also recognized a loss of $9.3 million before tax and $6.0 million after tax to write down the value of bonds in the Canadian branch investment portfolio to market value. These two charges, $200.2 million before and $196.9 million after tax, are included in the loss from discontinued operations.
 
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized losses of $14.7 million before tax and $5.3 million after tax related to its Japan and Argentina operations, which are accounted for as "held for sale" assets and as such must be reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Because the Company intends to have a continuing presence in each of these operations, they are not considered discontinued operations.
 
1st Quarter
 
Included in the net loss for the first quarter of 2003 is an increase in the Company's group long-term income protection GAAP reserves of $454.0 million before tax, or $295.1 million after tax. In April of 2003, the Company completed an analysis of its assumptions related to its group long-term income protection claim reserves. This analysis was initiated based on a trend in lower net claim recovery rates observed during the first quarter of 2003. The claim recovery rates during the first quarter were below expected levels and were lower than those experienced in the past three years. The analysis of emerging net claim recovery rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the Company's long-term expectations. Based on the analysis noted above, the Company increased its group long-term income protection claim reserves as of March 31, 2003 to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim recovery rates, but a change in claim recovery rates by claim duration.

2001 Extraordinary Loss and Subsequent Reclassification
 
4th Quarter
 
In 2001 the Company redeemed its $172.5 million par value 8.8% monthly income debt securities (junior subordinated debt), which were due in 2025 but callable at par in 2000 and thereafter. This early extinguishment of debt resulted in a write off of the remaining deferred debt cost of $4.5 million associated with the issuance of the securities. Prior to 2003, the write off was reported as an extraordinary loss of $2.9 million, net of a $1.6 million tax benefit, in accordance with then current Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4, . In 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 (SFAS 145), The effect of the adoption was the reporting reclassification of the extraordinary loss of $4.5 million to operating expense and the corresponding tax benefit of $1.6 million to income tax. The adoption of SFAS 145 had no effect on the Company's financial position or net income.
