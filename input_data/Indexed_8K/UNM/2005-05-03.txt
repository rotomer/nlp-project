Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) announced today its results for the first quarter of 2005.
 
The Company reported net income of $152.2 million ($0.49 per diluted common share) for the first quarter of 2005, compared to a net loss of $562.3 million ($1.91 per diluted common share) for the first quarter of 2004. Included in the results for the first quarter of 2005 are net realized after tax investment losses of $2.1 million ($0.01 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after tax investment gains of $16.1 million ($0.05 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2004. Included in net realized after tax investment gains and losses are after tax gains of $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2005 and $26.6 million in the first quarter of 2004 reflecting the increase in the fair value of DIG Issue B36 derivatives.
 
Also included in the results for the first quarter of 2004 is the impact of the restructuring of the Closed Block Individual Income Protection business, which reduced results $967.0 million before tax and $701.0 million after tax ($2.37 per diluted common share). The restructuring charges included a charge for reserve strengthening of $110.6 million before tax and the write-off of intangible assets of $856.4 million before tax. The first quarter of 2004 also includes income from discontinued operations totaling $7.0 million after tax ($0.02 per diluted common share).
Income from continuing operations was $154.3 million ($0.50 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $115.6 million ($0.39 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2004, excluding the net realized after tax investment gains and losses and the first quarter of 2004 restructuring charges. The Company believes operating income or loss, a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes realized investment gains and losses, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in the business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.
 
Also included in the first quarter of 2005 is the release of $32.0 million of income tax liabilities that relate primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions. The $32.0 million ($0.10 per diluted common share) increase to net income is reported as a reduction to income tax expense in the quarter.
 
"Although our operating results in the first quarter improved over the year ago performance, they did not meet our expectations," said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. "The majority of our operations met or exceeded our plans, but that was more than offset by adverse experience in our U.S. group income protection claims operations, which we believe has been temporarily disrupted by the implementation of changes made in response to the multistate regulatory settlement agreements we entered into at year-end and other process improvement initiatives undertaken in 2004. I believe we are seeing the effect on our claims operations of trying to absorb a considerable amount of change in a short period of time. We anticipated some disruption in claim processing and in the timing of claim decisions, but we experienced more in the first quarter than we expected. I believe that we will gradually restore our performance to more acceptable levels, and I am working very closely with our benefits area management team to assure that we are taking the necessary actions to improve performance while continuing to fully comply with our settlement agreements and maintaining the level of quality desired."
 
Results by Segment
 
In the following discussions of the Company's segment operating results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax, net realized investment gains and losses, and results of discontinued operations.
 
The Income Protection segment reported operating income of $79.7 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $74.3 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Within the segment, the group income protection line reported operating income of $42.3 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $30.3 million in the prior year first quarter. The benefit ratio for the
group income protection line was 90.5 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared to 89.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004. Claim recoveries and the timing of claim decisions were adversely impacted by disruption associated with the implementation of the organizational and procedural changes the Company made in response to the multistate regulatory settlement agreements entered into during the fourth quarter of 2004 and other process improvement initiatives. The Company currently believes this disruption is temporary and will not impact its long-term expectation for claim recovery rates. However, if the operational improvement the Company has projected occurs at a slower rate, there could be some additional costs in its claim operations over the next several quarters. Submitted incidence was generally flat in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the experience of the first quarter of 2004 and slightly higher as seasonally expected compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. The results in this business line also reflect improved earnings in the Company's U.K. subsidiary, Unum Limited, and in its U.S. group short-term income protection line of business.
 
Also within this segment, the recently issued individual income protection line of business reported operating income of $21.2 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to operating income of $29.3 million in the first quarter of 2004. The decline in earnings primarily reflects lower net investment income and a slight increase in the benefit ratio relative to the prior year first quarter results.
 
The long-term care line, which includes the results of both group and individual long-term care, reported operating income of $13.0 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $11.0 million in the first quarter of 2004. Finally, the disability management services line of business reported operating income of $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Premium income for the Income Protection segment increased 0.4 percent to $1,028.8 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $1,025.1 million in the first quarter of 2004. Within this segment, premium income for the group income protection line declined 1.7 percent to $773.9 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $786.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. Premium income for the recently issued individual income protection line increased 8.2 percent to $140.4 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $129.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. Finally, premium income for the long-term care line increased 5.6 percent to $114.5 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $108.4 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group long-term income protection fully insured products declined 15.8 percent to $54.8 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $65.1 million in the first quarter of 2004. The decline was attributable to lower sales at Unum Limited in the U. K. which offset a slight increase in new sales in the U.S. operations. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) for group short-term income protection fully insured products declined 37.7 percent to $16.0 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $25.7 million in the first quarter of 2004 due to declines in the overall employer market segment
sales. New annualized sales (paid for basis) for recently issued individual income protection increased 3.7 percent to $30.5 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $29.4 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Premium persistency in the Company's U.S. group long-term income protection business was 82.6 percent for the first quarter of 2005, compared to 84.8 percent for the full year 2004 and slightly higher than the Company's previous guidance. This decline is consistent with the Company's efforts to re-price portions of its in-force business in order to improve its profitability. Persistency in the Company's group short-term income protection line of business was 78.3 percent for the first quarter of 2005, compared to 80.6 percent for full year 2004 and slightly below the Company's previous guidance.
 
The Life and Accident segment reported operating income of $71.3 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $56.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. The improved performance is attributable to lower paid incidence levels relative to the year ago experience.
 
Premium income in this segment declined 4.0 percent to $470.4 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $490.1 million in the first quarter of 2004. New annualized sales (submitted date basis) in the group life line totaled $47.5 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $39.6 million in the first quarter of 2004. New annualized sales in the accidental death & dismemberment line of business totaled $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $2.5 million in the year ago quarter. New annualized sales in the brokerage voluntary life and other lines totaled $36.8 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $35.6 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Premium persistency in the Company's U.S. group life line of business was 72.5 percent for the first quarter of 2005, compared to 84.0 percent for full year 2004 and below the Company's previous guidance. The decline in persistency was due to higher terminations of some larger cases which had been targeted for significant rate increases.
 
The Colonial segment reported operating income of $43.8 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $36.6 million in the first quarter of 2004. The benefit ratio for this segment improved to 53.8 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared to 55.5 percent in the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a lower benefit ratio for the life product line. Premium income for this segment increased 6.8 percent to $193.5 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $181.1 million in the first quarter of 2004. New annualized sales in this segment declined 0.6 percent to $61.3 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $61.7 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
The Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to a loss of $923.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. Included in the segment results for the first quarter of 2004 are the charges related to the restructuring of this segment. Recovery trends in this segment were generally lower in the first quarter of 2005 relative to the first quarter of
2004, reflecting the implementation of the claims management changes during the quarter. Premium income for this segment was $242.0 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $251.3 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
The Other segment, which includes results from products no longer actively marketed, reported operating income of $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
The Corporate segment, which includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, and certain other corporate expenses, reported a loss of $39.2 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to a loss of $46.7 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
The Company's average number of shares outstanding used to calculate the per diluted common share results was 307,610,852 for the first quarter of 2005, compared to 294,989,771 for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Book value per common share at March 31, 2005 was $23.68, compared to $24.08 at March 31, 2004.

2005 Other Item
 
1st Quarter
 
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service completed its audit of the 1999  2001 years for the Company and issued its revenue agent's report (RAR). A number of the proposed adjustments in the RAR are in dispute and will be appealed by the Company. Income tax liabilities of approximately $32.0 million that relate primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of 2005, all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense.
 
2004 Offering
 
In May 2004, the Company issued 12,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) in a private offering for $300.0 million. The Company subsequently registered the privately placed securities for resale by the private investors. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on May 15, 2007 and (b) a 1/40 or 2.5% ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2009 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $300.0 million and will issue between 17.7 million and 20.4 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common sharesassuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $16.95 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. The impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common sharesassuming dilution, including the 2003 unit offering (see "2003 Public Offerings" discussion following), at various quarterly average stock price levels is as follows:
 
 
2004 Other Items
 
4th Quarter
 
In the fourth quarter 2004, certain of the Company's insurance subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination led by Maine, Massachusetts, and Tennessee relating to disability claims handling practices. A total of 48 states and the District of Columbia are parties to the settlement agreements. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor, which had been conducting an inquiry relating to certain ERISA plans, is a party to the settlement agreements, and the New York Attorney General's Office, which had engaged in its own investigation of the Company's claims handling practices, notified the Company that it was in support of the settlement and was, therefore, closing its investigation on this issue. The examination report did not make any findings of violations of law or market conduct regulations. However, the examination report did identify areas of concern. These became the focus of specific changes and enhancements to the Company's disability claims handling operations which are designed to assure each claim decision is made in a consistently high quality manner.
 
The primary components of the settlement agreements include:
 
 
 
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a loss of $127.0 million before tax, or $87.8 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $27.5 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the two-year reassessment process; $44.0 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $40.5 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $15.0 million fine. The ongoing costs of changes in the claims handling process and governance improvements will be included in the Company's operating expenses as incurred going forward. These ongoing costs are not anticipated to materially affect the Company's results of operations.
 
2nd Quarter
 
In June 2004, the Company amended its postretirement medical plan and as a result of this amendment, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of $9.4 million before tax in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Also during the second quarter of 2004, the Company closed the sale of its Canadian operations and reported a loss of $113.0 million before tax and $70.9 million after tax on the sale of the branch. Assets transferred to the buyer included available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $1,099.4 million and a book value of $957.7 million. Liabilities transferred included reserves of $1,254.8 million. The Company retained a portion of the Canadian branch fixed maturity bond portfolio according to the terms of the transaction. The bonds retained had a fair value, at April 30, 2004, of $732.9 million and a yield of 7.14 percent. These investments, which were redeployed to other lines of business during the remainder of the year, added approximately four basis points to the investment portfolio yield rate, at April 30, 2004, in the Company's continuing operations.
 
1st Quarter
 
In the first quarter of 2004, the Company restructured its individual income protection  closed block business wherein three of its insurance subsidiaries entered into reinsurance agreements to reinsure approximately 66.7 percent of potential future losses that occur above a specified retention limit. The individual income protection  closed block reserves in these three subsidiaries comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's overall retained risk in the closed block of individual income protection. The reinsurance agreements effectively provide approximately 60 percent reinsurance coverage for the Company's overall consolidated risk above the retention limit. The maximum risk limit for the reinsurer is approximately $783.0 million initially and grows to approximately $2.6 billion over time, after which any further losses will revert to the Company. These reinsurance transactions were effective as of April 1, 2004. The Company transferred cash equal to $521.6 million of reserves ceded in the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment plus an additional $185.8 million in cash for a before-tax prepaid cost of insurance which was deferred and is being amortized into earnings over the expected claim payment period covered under the Company's retention limit. The Company retained the higher yielding investments historically associated with these reserves and redeployed these investments to other lines of business.
 
In conjunction with the restructuring of the individual income protection  closed block business, effective January 1, 2004, the Company modified its reporting segments to include a separate segment for this business. The reporting, monitoring, and management of the closed block of individual income protection business as a discrete segment is consistent with the Company's financial restructuring and separation of this business from the lines of business which actively market new products. In the past, this business had been reported in the Income Protection segment. Prior to 2004, detailed separate financial metrics and models were unavailable to appropriately manage this block of business separately from the recently issued individual income protection block of business.
 
The change in the Company's reporting segments required the Company to perform, separately for the individual income protection  closed block business and individual income protection  recently issued business, impairment testing for goodwill and loss recognition testing for the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired. As required under GAAP, prior to the change in reporting segments, these tests were performed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. The testing indicated impairment of the individual income protection  closed block deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired, and goodwill balances of $282.2 million, $367.1 million, and $207.1 million, respectively. These impairment charges, $856.4 million before tax and $629.1 million after tax, are included in the net loss reported for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Also as part of the restructuring, the Company analyzed the reserve assumptions related to its individual income protection  closed block reserves as a stand-alone segment. Previously these reserves were analyzed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. Included in the analysis was a review of morbidity assumptions, primarily claim resolution rates, and claim reserve discount rate assumptions. Based upon this analysis, the Company lowered the claim reserve discount rate to reflect the segmentation of assets between the individual income protection  recently issued business and the individual income protection  closed block business, the change in the Company's investment portfolio yield rates during the first quarter of 2004, the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates, and the Company's desire to maintain the relationship between the claim reserve discount rate and the investment portfolio yield rate for the individual income protection  closed block at the Company's long-term objective. The segmentation of the investment portfolio was necessary to ensure appropriate matching of the duration of the assets and the related policy liabilities. Based on this analysis, in the first quarter of 2004 the Company increased its individual income protection  closed block claim reserves by $110.6 million before tax, or $71.9 million after tax, to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The first quarter 2004 change represented a 1.2 percent increase in total net individual income protection  closed block reserves as of March 31, 2004, which equaled $9.530 billion prior to this increase.
 
2003 Accounting Principle Changes
 
4th Quarter
 
Effective October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36), DIG Issue B36 addresses financial accounting and reporting for embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance contracts that incorporate credit risk exposure unrelated to the credit risk of the counterparty to the reinsurance contract and requires the bifurcation of any such derivative from the host reinsurance contract. The Company has two reinsurance contracts for which DIG Issue B36 is applicable. The adoption of DIG Issue B36 resulted in an increase in fixed maturity securities of $61.3 million to record the fair value of the embedded derivatives and a $39.9 million cumulative effect of accounting principle change, net of $21.4 million in tax.
Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposure That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments.
 
Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 (Interpretation 46), . Interpretation 46 expands upon ARB No. 51, , to address financial accounting and reporting for certain entities in which a controlling financial interest cannot be identified based on an evaluation of voting interests. Transition to the provisions of Interpretation 46 required the Company to consolidate four special purpose entities whose purposes are to support the Company's investment objectives. Prior to December 31, 2003, these entities were accounted for as fixed maturity securities in the available for sale portfolio and carried at fair value which was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. For these four entities, the adoption of Interpretation 46 had no impact on the fair value of total invested assets reported in the Company's consolidated statement of financial condition.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51
Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Adoption of Interpretation 46 also resulted in the de-consolidation of a trust that currently holds $300.0 million of junior subordinated debt securities of the Company and has issued a similar amount of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The impact of the de-consolidation was the elimination of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debt securities of the company included in the consolidated statement of financial condition and an increase of $300.0 million in long-term debt.
 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, , and selected the prospective method of adoption allowed under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, . The adoption decreased after tax results for 2003 approximately $0.6 million.

2003 Public Offerings
 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued a total of 52,877,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, related to a public offering and received approximately $547.7 million in proceeds. In addition, the Company issued a total of 23,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) related to a public offering for $575.0 million. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on May 15, 2006 and (b) a 1/40, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2008 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $575.0 million and will issue between 43.3 million and 52.9 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common sharesassuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $13.27 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. See "2004 Offering" discussion preceding for the impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common shares-assuming dilution at various quarterly average stock price levels.
 
2003 Other Items
 
4th Quarter
 
Included in the fourth quarter of 2003 results is an after tax increase in group income protection reserves of $286.0 million, or $440.0 million before tax. In January 2004, the Company completed its annual review of claim reserves to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses. Approximately $300.0 million of the reserve strengthening reflects implementation of a lower discount rate for its group income protection claim reserves. The discount rate was lowered to reflect the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates and the Company's new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate. The Company's new discount rate management approach is intended to better reflect the current investment environment and position the Company to be more responsive with discount rates on new incurred claims as changes to the investment environment emerge. Approximately $140.0 million of the reserve increase relates to a strengthening of the morbidity assumptions to reflect the impact of the continuing weak economic cycle on claim incidence and severity. Claim incidence in the second half of 2003 was 8 percent higher than the first half of the year and 5 percent above the second half of 2002. Increased claim incidence is expected to continue at an elevated level for several quarters as the early indications of a recovering economy are not yet reflected in improved consumer confidence or job creation. The reserve increase represents a 5.4 percent increase in total net group income protection reserves as of December 31, 2003, which were $8.186 billion prior to this increase.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Canadian branch and expects the transaction to close during the first half of 2004. The Canadian branch is accounted for as "held for sale" at December 31, 2003 and also meets the accounting criteria for being reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with the classification of the Canadian branch as held for sale, the Company tested the goodwill related to the Canadian branch for impairment and determined that the balance of $190.9 million was impaired. The Company also recognized a loss of $9.3 million before tax and $6.0 million after tax to write down the value of bonds in the Canadian branch investment portfolio to market value. These two charges, $200.2 million before and $196.9 million after tax, are included in the loss from discontinued operations.
 
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized losses of $14.7 million before tax and $5.3 million after tax related to its Japan and Argentina operations, which are accounted for as "held for sale" assets and as such must be reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Because the Company intends to have a continuing presence in each of these operations, they are not considered discontinued operations.
 
1st Quarter
 
Included in the net loss for the first quarter of 2003 is an increase in the Company's group long-term income protection GAAP reserves of $454.0 million before tax, or $295.1 million after tax. In April of 2003, the Company completed an analysis of its assumptions related to its group long-term income protection claim reserves. This analysis was initiated based on a trend in lower net claim recovery rates observed during the first quarter of 2003. The claim recovery rates during the first quarter were below expected levels and were lower than those experienced in the past three years. The analysis of emerging net claim recovery rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the Company's long-term expectations. Based on the analysis noted above, the Company increased its group long-term income protection claim reserves as of March 31, 2003 to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim recovery rates, but a change in claim recovery rates by claim duration.
