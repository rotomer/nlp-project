Item 5.02 (b) Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
 
The Company announced that E. Michael Caulfield, a member of its Board of Directors since August 2004, has accepted a position as chief operating officer of Mercer HR Consulting, a firm with which the Company does business. As part of its business, Mercer acts as a broker for customers who purchase the Company's insurance products and services. The Company also has advisory relationships with Mercer unrelated to Mercer's brokerage business. After reviewing the various relationships, Mr. Caulfield and the Company's Board of Directors determined that Mr. Caulfield's independence as a director could be affected and that it would be prudent that he not continue as a director of the Company. Mr. Caulfield resigned effective July 6, 2005.
