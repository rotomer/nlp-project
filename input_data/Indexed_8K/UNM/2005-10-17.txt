2005 Other Items
3rd Quarter
ADD NOTE FOR SEGMENT CHANGE
 
1st Quarter
 
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service completed its current examination of the Company and issued its revenue agent's report (RAR). Income tax liabilities of approximately $32.0 million that relate primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of 2005, all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense. A number of the proposed adjustments in the RAR are in dispute and will be appealed by the Company. The Company holds adequate reserves for the liabilities associated with these proposed adjustments.
 
2004 Offering
 
In May 2004, the Company issued 12,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) in a private offering for $300.0 million. The Company subsequently registered the privately placed securities for resale by the private investors. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on May 15, 2007 and (b) a 1/40 or 2.5% ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2009 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $300.0 million and will issue between 17.7 million and 20.4 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common shares - assuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $16.95 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. The impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common shares - assuming dilution, including the 2003 unit offering (see "2003 Public Offerings" discussion following), at various quarterly average stock price levels is as follows:
 
 
2004 Other Items
4th Quarter
 
In the fourth quarter 2004, certain of the Company's insurance subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination led by Maine, Massachusetts, and Tennessee relating to disability claims handling practices. A total of 48 states and the District of Columbia are parties to the settlement agreements. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor, which had been conducting an inquiry relating to certain ERISA plans, is a party to the settlement agreements, and the New York Attorney General's Office, which had engaged in its own investigation of the Company's claims handling practices, notified the Company that it was in support of the settlement and was, therefore, closing its investigation on this issue.
 
The examination report did not make any findings of violations of law or market conduct regulations. However, the examination report did identify areas of concern. These became the focus of specific changes and enhancements to the Company's disability claims handling operations which are designed to assure each claim decision is made in a consistently high quality manner.
 
The primary components of the settlement agreements include:
 
 
 
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a loss of $127.0 million before tax, or $87.8 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $27.5 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the two-year reassessment process; $44.0 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $40.5 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $15.0 million fine. The ongoing costs of changes in the claims handling process and governance improvements will be included in the Company's operating expenses as incurred going forward. These ongoing costs are not anticipated to materially affect the Company's results of operations.
 
2nd Quarter
 
In June 2004, the Company amended its postretirement medical plan and as a result of this amendment, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of $9.4 million before tax in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Also during the second quarter of 2004, the Company closed the sale of its Canadian operations and reported a loss of $113.0 million before tax and $70.9 million after tax on the sale of the branch. Assets transferred to the buyer included available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $1,099.4 million and a book value of $957.7 million. Liabilities transferred included reserves of $1,254.8 million. The Company retained a portion of the Canadian branch fixed maturity bond portfolio according to the terms of the transaction. The bonds retained had a fair value, at April 30, 2004, of $732.9 million and a yield of 7.14 percent. These investments, which were redeployed to other lines of business during the remainder of the year, added approximately four basis points to the investment portfolio yield rate, at April 30, 2004, in the Company's continuing operations.
 
1st Quarter
 
In the first quarter of 2004, the Company restructured its individual income protection  closed block business wherein three of its insurance subsidiaries entered into reinsurance agreements to reinsure approximately 66.7 percent of potential future losses that occur above a specified retention limit. The individual income protection  closed block reserves in these three subsidiaries comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's overall retained risk in the closed block of individual income protection. The reinsurance agreements effectively provide approximately 60 percent reinsurance coverage for the Company's overall consolidated risk above the retention limit. The maximum risk limit for the reinsurer is approximately $783.0 million initially and grows to approximately $2.6 billion over time, after which any further losses will revert to the Company. These reinsurance transactions were effective as of April 1, 2004. The Company transferred cash equal to $521.6 million of reserves ceded in the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment plus an additional $185.8 million in cash for a before-tax prepaid cost of insurance which was deferred and is being amortized into earnings over the expected claim payment period covered under the Company's retention limit. The Company retained the higher yielding investments historically associated with these reserves and redeployed these investments to other lines of business.
 
In conjunction with the restructuring of the individual income protection  closed block business, effective January 1, 2004, the Company modified its reporting segments to include a separate segment for this business. The reporting, monitoring, and management of the closed block of individual income protection business as a discrete segment is consistent with the Company's financial restructuring and separation of this business from the lines of business which actively market new products. In the past, this business had been reported in the Income Protection segment. Prior to 2004, detailed separate financial metrics and models were unavailable to appropriately manage this block of business separately from the recently issued individual income protection block of business.
 
The change in the Company's reporting segments required the Company to perform, separately for the individual income protection  closed block business and individual income protection  recently issued business, impairment testing for goodwill and loss recognition testing for the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired. As required under GAAP, prior to the change in reporting segments, these tests were performed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. The testing indicated impairment of the individual income protection  closed block deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired, and goodwill balances of $282.2 million, $367.1 million, and $207.1 million, respectively. These impairment charges, $856.4 million before tax and $629.1 million after tax, are included in the net loss reported for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Also as part of the restructuring, the Company analyzed the reserve assumptions related to its individual income protection  closed block reserves as a stand-alone segment. Previously these reserves were analyzed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. Included in the analysis was a review of morbidity assumptions, primarily claim resolution rates, and claim reserve discount rate assumptions. Based upon this analysis, the Company lowered the claim reserve discount rate to reflect the segmentation of assets between the individual income protection  recently issued business and the individual income protection  closed block business, the change in the Company's investment portfolio yield rates during the first quarter of 2004, the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates, and the Company's desire to maintain the relationship between the claim reserve discount rate and the investment portfolio yield rate for the individual income protection  closed block at the Company's long-term objective. The segmentation of the investment portfolio was necessary to ensure appropriate matching of the duration of the assets and the related policy liabilities. Based on this analysis, in the first quarter of 2004 the Company increased its individual income protection  closed block claim reserves by $110.6 million before tax, or $71.9 million after tax, to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The first quarter 2004 change represented a 1.2 percent increase in total net individual income protection  closed block reserves as of March 31, 2004, which equaled $9.530 billion prior to this increase.
 
2003 Accounting Principle Changes
4th Quarter
 
Effective October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36), DIG Issue B36 addresses financial accounting and reporting for embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance contracts that incorporate credit risk exposure unrelated to the credit risk of the counterparty to the reinsurance contract and requires the bifurcation of any such derivative from the host reinsurance contract. The Company has two reinsurance contracts for which DIG Issue B36 is applicable. The adoption of DIG Issue B36 resulted in an increase in fixed maturity securities of $61.3 million to record the fair value of the embedded derivatives and a $39.9 million cumulative effect of accounting principle change, net of $21.4 million in tax.
Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposure That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments.
 
Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 (Interpretation 46), . Interpretation 46 expands upon ARB No. 51, , to address financial accounting and reporting for certain entities in which a controlling financial interest cannot be identified based on an evaluation of voting interests. Transition to the provisions of Interpretation 46 required the Company to consolidate four special purpose entities whose purposes are to support the Company's investment objectives. Prior to December 31, 2003, these entities were accounted for as fixed maturity securities in the available for sale portfolio and carried at fair value which was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. For these four entities, the adoption of Interpretation 46 had no impact on the fair value of total invested assets reported in the Company's consolidated statement of financial condition.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51
Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Adoption of Interpretation 46 also resulted in the de-consolidation of a trust that currently holds $300.0 million of junior subordinated debt securities of the Company and has issued a similar amount of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The impact of the de-consolidation was the elimination of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debt securities of the company included in the consolidated statement of financial condition and an increase of $300.0 million in long-term debt.
 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, , and selected the prospective method of adoption allowed under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, . The adoption decreased after tax results for 2003 approximately $0.6 million.

2003 Public Offerings
 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued a total of 52,877,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, related to a public offering and received approximately $547.7 million in proceeds. In addition, the Company issued a total of 23,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) related to a public offering for $575.0 million. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on May 15, 2006 and (b) a 1/40, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2008 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $575.0 million and will issue between 43.3 million and 52.9 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common shares - assuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $13.27 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. See "2004 Offering" discussion preceding for the impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common shares-assuming dilution at various quarterly average stock price levels.
 
2003 Other Items
4th Quarter
 
Included in the fourth quarter of 2003 results is an after tax increase in U.S. Brokerage group income protection reserves of $286.0 million, or $440.0 million before tax. In January 2004, the Company completed its annual review of claim reserves to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses. Approximately $300.0 million of the reserve strengthening reflects implementation of a lower discount rate for its U.S. Brokerage group income protection claim reserves. The discount rate was lowered to reflect the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates and the Company's new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate. The Company's new discount rate management approach is intended to better reflect the current investment environment and position the Company to be more responsive with discount rates on new incurred claims as changes to the investment environment emerge. Approximately $140.0 million of the reserve increase relates to a strengthening of the morbidity assumptions to reflect the impact of the continuing weak economic cycle on claim incidence and severity. Claim incidence in the second half of 2003 was 8 percent higher than the first half of the year and 5 percent above the second half of 2002. Increased claim incidence is expected to continue at an elevated level for several quarters as the early indications of a recovering economy are not yet reflected in improved consumer confidence or job creation. The reserve increase represents a 6.6 percent increase in total net U.S. Brokerage group income protection reserves as of December 31, 2003, which were $6.674 billion prior to this increase.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Canadian branch and expects the transaction to close during the first half of 2004. The Canadian branch is accounted for as "held for sale" at December 31, 2003 and also meets the accounting criteria for being reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with the classification of the Canadian branch as held for sale, the Company tested the goodwill related to the Canadian branch for impairment and determined that the balance of $190.9 million was impaired. The Company also recognized a loss of $9.3 million before tax and $6.0 million after tax to write down the value of bonds in the Canadian branch investment portfolio to market value. These two charges, $200.2 million before and $196.9 million after tax, are included in the loss from discontinued operations.
 
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized losses of $14.7 million before tax and $5.3 million after tax related to its Japan and Argentina operations, which are accounted for as "held for sale" assets and as such must be reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Because the Company intends to have a continuing presence in each of these operations, they are not considered discontinued operations.
 
1st Quarter
 
Included in the net loss for the first quarter of 2003 is an increase in the Company's U.S. Brokerage group long-term income protection GAAP reserves of $454.0 million before tax, or $295.1 million after tax. In April of 2003, the Company completed an analysis of its assumptions related to its group long-term income protection claim reserves. This analysis was initiated based on a trend in lower net claim recovery rates observed during the first quarter of 2003. The claim recovery rates during the first quarter were below expected levels and were lower than those experienced in the past three years. The analysis of emerging net claim recovery rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the Company's long-term expectations. Based on the analysis noted above, the Company increased its U.S. Brokerage group long-term income protection claim reserves as of March 31, 2003 to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim recovery rates, but a change in claim recovery rates by claim duration.
 
2002 Cumulative Effect of Accounting Principle Change
1st Quarter
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 142 was a decrease to net income of $7.1 million, net of a tax benefit of $3.9 million.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

The New Reporting Format
Why re-segment?
We believe the new segments will better align our external reporting with the internal management of our business lines, in accordance with SFAS 131.
The growth of our UK business, Unum Limited, suggests that it be reported separately. Provide better transparency around our US Brokerage business, including the Group Income Protection line, a key element of the Company's expected future profit improvement.
A 2Q-2005 statistical supplement on new basis is available and included in today's presentation material.
The 3Q-2005 earnings will be reported in new segment format.

Financial Goals
Double digit growth in BTOE over the next three years from operational improvements.
Primarily driven by U.S. Brokerage operation, particularly the Group Income Protection line Stable performance in other major lines
ROE improvement potential from 8.7% currently to range of 9% to 11% over the next three years from these operational improvements, but prior to capital management decisions.
Generate approximately $1 billion of excess capital over three year timeframe.

Rating Agency Outlook
Improving the A.M. Best rating and re-gaining investment grade debt status are important objectives for us.
With questions around investment portfolio and capital largely addressed, we believe the rating agencies are focused on:
Consistent operating performance/profitability Coverage ratios
We believe our plans are "rating agency friendly" as they focus on:
U.S. Group Income Protection profitability Further de-leveraging Building financial flexibility
While our business has held up well though the recent downgrades, we believe that ratings upgrades are an important element of our future success.

The interest margin remained above the 60 b.p. target in 2Q05 as downward adjustments in the new claim incurrals made in previous quarters lowered the overall claim discount rate. The low level of rates continues to pressure the portfolio yield.

California Settlement
Summary
(cont.)
On-going Impact:
New interpretations will pressure California based earnings for UNM and entire industry. New interpretations suggest price increases are needed on LTD.
Clients will either pay higher premium or buy a product with reduced benefits to offset increased costs.
We have built monitoring mechanisms for:
Claims activity: What claim outcomes are we experiencing Renewal activity: What rate levels are sticking Sales activity: bid/ask spread on quotes
Cost reductions are likely to help offset the expected profit pressure on California business.

Business Review  U.S. Brokerage
Introduction
Our U.S. Brokerage business is the largest part of UnumProvident, and its results are the largest potential driver of improvement in shareholder value.
The lynchpin of our U.S. Brokerage business is our Group Income Protection franchise.
The long-term characteristics of the Group Income Protection business are favorable:
Inforce premium growth potential of 2% to 4% more than GDP
Cyclical business that must be managed accordingly; profitable disciplined growth
Our position in the market remains outstanding.
Market share is down slightly but still a competitive strength
Customer surveys and business retention suggest our "franchise" is very much intact
86
 
Business Review  U.S. Brokerage
Introduction
Our immediate focus is on continuing to improve the profitability of the "core" Group Income Protection line.
Multi-year strategy launched in 2003 following corporate restructuring
Claims disruption from multi-state settlement has masked the improvement in 2005 While the core is being improved, the balance of U.S. Brokerage is performing at solid, but not target levels
Our bottom line objective is to improve the before tax margins of the U.S. Brokerage operations to 12%-13% over the next 2 years, with a corresponding target ROE range of 9%-11%.
Primary driver of this improvement must be our Group Income Protection line.

Our overall US Brokerage headcount has been reduced by 17% since 2002 as a result of these and many other operating effectiveness initiatives.
Our printing and paper related costs have declined 35% since 2002 as a result of web enabled services, imaging and workflow automation.
Also, our retention of employers who are on our iServices platform is higher as are customer satisfaction results for these employers.

Business Review  U.S. Brokerage
Earlier this year we began an initiative that will transform our small and mid size group and supplemental market (approximately 30% of expense base):
The following solutions are being undertaken to begin a transformation of our operations:
A single integrated customer administration technology platform for group, voluntary and multi life products
Simplified and integrated product solutions
Customer-oriented processes vs. product, function or line of business
Broadened use of web-enabled self service solutions including CRM solutions
Centralized account management and best in class contact center technology
Provide local enrollment utilizing our new Plane.biz enrollment technology
We expect this transformation to enable us to be the lowest unit cost provider in this market and we have benchmarked ourselves against our competitors accordingly.
We also expect gains in the areas of employer customer retention, participation levels, speed to market while maintaining our leading customer satisfaction.

Business Review - Individual Income Protection Closed Block
182
 
Individual Income Protection  Closed Block
Introduction
In the first quarter of 2004, the Company set up a separate GAAP reporting segment comprised of the older blocks of IDI business (the "CDB").
The primary objectives for this reporting change were to improve the transparency of reporting and show the true value of this business.
The re-segmentation was a part of an overall restructuring of this line of business which included:
Write-off of intangibles ($856 million)
Reserve strengthening ($110.6 million)
Capital raising ($300 million)
Reinsurance coverage
183
 
Individual Income Protection  Closed Block
Introduction
The CDB is stable, predictable, and relatively insensitive to changes over time.
CDB is profitable and generates significant positive cash flows worth an estimated $1 billion on NPV basis.
Claim results and liability cash flows expected to remain stable and predictable due to:
The CDB is a seasoned block of business which significantly reduces the volatility associated with the run-out of future liabilities.
Over half of the CDB reserves cover long duration claims with risk characteristics similar to SPIA.
The absence of occupational concentrations other than physicians makes it unlikely that the block would be subject to a severe and sustained increase in morbidity.

CDB Overview
Included in the CDB are:
Provident Life and Accident (PLA) and Provident Life and Casualty (PLC) policies written, reinsured or assumed prior to Jan 1, 1994.
Paul Revere Life ( PRL) policies written, reinsured or assumed prior to April 1, 1997.

Previous experience problems were driven by a combination of underpricing and claim shocks in the physician sector.
At its peak, physician morbidity increased 30% and the block morbidity increased ~ 10%.
Because the CDB is not writing new business and no other occupation has near the exposure of doctors, it is highly unlikely the CDB would experience a 5% deterioration in overall morbidity.

Existing Reinsurance Provides Valuable Capital Support Through Risk Transfer
NICO Structure
During 2004, three of the company's insurance subsidiaries (PLA, PLC, and PRL) entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement that provides additional protection against losses above basic reserve levels
The reinsurance coverage provides coinsurance protection for future losses above a specified retention limit subject to a maximum limit amount
The reinsurer's maximum risk limit will grow over time with interest to a maximum limit cap; the maximum risk limit is initially ~ $783 million and ultimately grows to $2.55 billion ($2.01 billion in 2024 as illustrated)
Losses above the maximum limit cap revert to the company
Purpose: Long Term Loss Deterioration Protection

Centre Re Recapture
The Company announced its intention to the Centre Re block effective prior to December 31, 2005.
With our RBC ratio currently above our 300% target level and the benefits of the agreement largely discounted, we felt it was the appropriate time to execute the recapture.
Recapture was effective August 8, 2005 and will begin to be reflected in 3Q Closed Disability Block segment.
This block is stable and performs reasonably well, producing a small statutory gain and roughly break-even on a GAAP basis.
The RBC impact of 14 points will be split over 2005 and 2006 as the invested assets, reserves and premiums come back to our books.
Year-end 2005 RBC expected in-line with year-end 2004 levels.

Summary
The CDB is a relatively stable, mature block of business which represents real value to the Company.
The block ties up a significant amount of capital and its low ROE produces a drag on the corporate ROE.
There is significant effort underway at the Company to better realize the value we believe is embedded in the block but not recognized in the Company's valuation.
