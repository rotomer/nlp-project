Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) announced today its results for the third quarter of 2005.
 
The Company reported net income of $52.6 million ($0.17 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2005, compared to $167.6 million ($0.55 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2004. Included in the results for the third quarter of 2005 are net realized after tax investment losses of $46.3 million ($0.14 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after tax investment gains of $41.8 million ($0.14 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2004. Included in net realized after tax investment gains and losses are after tax losses of $47.6 million in the third quarter of 2005 and after tax gains of $54.5 million in the third quarter of 2004 reflecting the change in the fair value of DIG Issue B36 derivatives. Excluding the DIG Issue B36 derivatives, net realized after tax investment gains were $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to losses of $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Also included in the third quarter of 2005 is a charge of $75.0 million before tax, or $51.6 million after tax ($0.16 per diluted common share), related to the settlement of the California Department of Insurance market conduct examination and related matters, which was previously announced on October 3, 2005, a gain of $5.7 million before tax, or $4.0 million after tax ($0.01 per diluted common share), from the sale of Unum Limited's European branch based in the Netherlands, and an income tax benefit of $10.8
million ($0.03 per diluted common share) related to the finalization of income tax reviews of the Company's U.K. subsidiaries.
 
Income excluding net realized after tax investment gains and losses, the charge related to the settlement, the gain on the Netherlands branch, and the income tax benefit was $135.7 million ($0.43 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $125.8 million ($0.41 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2004. (See discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliation below.)
 
"I am pleased with our results for the third quarter which reflect continued progress in areas that we had targeted for improvement this year," said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. "Specifically, in our U.S. Brokerage segment we are seeing signs of improvement in the profitability of our group income protection line of business, a line of business which has underperformed in the past, and we are also seeing sales momentum building in areas targeted for growth. In addition, our primary operating subsidiaries  Unum Limited and Colonial  again reported strong results. Although we still face challenges, as we have continued to deliver gradual but steady improvement in our results, our confidence continues to build."
 
Results by Segment
 
Effective July 1, 2005, the Company modified its reporting segments to separate its United States business from that of its United Kingdom subsidiary, Unum Limited, due to the continued growth in that subsidiary and to recent organizational changes within the Company which established a separate management team to focus solely on the U.S. Brokerage lines of business. The Company's new reporting segments are comprised of the following: U.S. Brokerage, Unum Limited (U.K. business), Colonial, Individual Income Protection  Closed Block, Other, and Corporate.
 
The U.S. Brokerage segment includes the results of the Company's U.S. group income protection insurance, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, including individual income protection  recently issued, group and individual long-term care, and brokerage voluntary workplace benefits products. The Unum Limited segment is comprised primarily of group income protection and group life products. The products now reported in the U.S. Brokerage segment and the Unum Limited segment were previously combined and reported in the Income Protection and Life and Accident segments.
 
The results of the disability management services business are now reported in the Other segment, which has been redefined to include the disability management services business as well as results from U.S. Brokerage insured products not actively marketed (with the exception of certain individual income protection
products). There were no changes to the Colonial, Individual Income Protection  Closed Block, or Corporate segments. Segment information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 has been reclassified to conform to the current reporting segments.
 
In the following discussions of the Company's segment operating results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
The U. S. Brokerage segment reported operating income of $71.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $113.5 million in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the charge of $40.7 million related to the California settlement agreement and related matters, operating income was $112.6 million in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Within this segment, the U. S. Brokerage group income protection line of business reported an operating loss of $6.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to income of $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the charge of $37.4 million related to the settlement agreement and related matters, operating income was $31.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. The benefit ratio for group income protection was 96.8 percent in the third quarter of 2005, and excluding the impact of the charge was 92.4 percent, compared to 92.9 percent in the third quarter of 2004 and 93.5 percent in the second quarter of 2005. Claim recoveries and the timing of claim decisions continued to be adversely impacted by the implementation of the organizational and procedural changes the Company made in response to the multistate regulatory settlement agreements entered into during the fourth quarter of 2004 and other process improvement initiatives. Certain of these procedural and organizational changes have been addressed, and while the disruption has not been eliminated, progress was made during the third quarter in restoring operational effectiveness. While the impact of the disruption reduced the operating income in the Company's U.S. group long-term income protection line of business in the third quarter of 2005 relative to the year ago quarter, the impact of the disruption was reduced relative to the second quarter of 2005. Claim incidence and recovery trends in the Company's group long-term income protection line in the third quarter of 2005 were generally flat with the second quarter of 2005 and compared favorably with the levels of the year ago quarter. Premium income in this line of business declined 4.9 percent to $626.0 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $658.2 million in the third quarter of 2004, reflecting lower sales and persistency in recent quarters as the Company has focused on improving the profitability of the business. Sales of fully insured group long-term income protection products in the third quarter of 2005 increased 16.0 percent to $27.6 million, compared to $23.8 million in the year ago quarter, and sales of fully insured group short-term income protection products in the third quarter of 2005 increased 38.6 percent to $11.5 million, compared to $8.3 million in the year ago quarter. Premium persistency in the group long-term income protection line of business was 84.4 percent for the first nine months of 2005, compared to 84.8 percent for full year 2004.
Also within this segment, the U. S. Brokerage group life and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business reported operating income of $41.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to operating income of $54.6 million in the third quarter of 2004. The decline in earnings primarily reflects a decline in revenue and a higher expense ratio, while the benefit ratio remained stable relative to the prior year results. Premium income for this line of business declined 10.6 percent to $355.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $398.3 million in the third quarter of 2004, reflecting lower sales and persistency in recent quarters as the Company has focused on improving the profitability of the business in a competitive market environment. Sales of group life products in the third quarter of 2005 declined 15.5 percent to $23.4 million, compared to $27.7 million in the year ago quarter, with a decline in large case sales offsetting improved sales results in the small and mid-sized markets. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 77.3 percent for the first nine months of 2005, compared to 84.0 percent for full year 2004. The decline in persistency was due to higher terminations of some larger cases which had been targeted for significant rate increases.
 
Also within this segment, the U. S. Brokerage supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported operating income of $36.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $42.2 million in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the charge of $3.3 million related to the settlement agreement and related matters, operating income was $39.5 million in the third quarter of 2005. The decline in earnings is primarily driven by a higher benefit ratio in the long-term care line of business. Premium income increased 6.7 percent to $311.6 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $291.9 million in the third quarter of 2004, with higher premium income in all product lines. New annualized sales in the voluntary workplace benefits line of business increased 19.0 percent in the third quarter of 2005 relative to the third quarter of 2004, while long-term care sales were flat with the year ago quarter and individual income protection  recently issued sales declined 13.0 percent.
 
The Unum Limited segment reported operating income of $49.8 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $38.1 million in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the $5.7 million before tax gain on the sale of the Netherlands branch, operating income was $44.1 million in the third quarter of 2005. The improvement in operating income in this segment benefited from continued strong revenue growth, generally stable benefit ratios resulting from favorable claims management results, and a lower expense ratio relative to the year ago quarter. Premium income for this segment increased 19.9 percent to $204.0 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $170.1 million in the third quarter of 2004. New annualized sales in this segment declined 37.5 percent to $24.7 million in the third quarter of 2005 from $39.5 million in the third quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting lower group life sales due to competitive pricing conditions in this market.
The Colonial segment reported operating income of $42.0 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $39.6 million in the third quarter of 2004. Improved results in the income protection and other lines of business offset a decline in the life line of business. Premium income for this segment increased 5.9 percent to $197.4 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $186.4 million in the third quarter of 2004. New annualized sales in this segment increased 1.1 percent to $61.9 million in the third quarter of 2005 from $61.2 million in the third quarter of 2004.
 
The Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment reported an operating loss of $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to income of $33.2 million in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the charge of $34.3 million related to the California settlement agreement and related matters, operating income was $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. Claim incidence trends were generally lower than the levels of the prior quarter and year ago quarter, however claim recovery experience was generally lower than the experience of the prior quarter and year ago quarter. Premium income for this segment was $257.6 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $246.8 million in the third quarter of 2004. The recapture during the third quarter of a closed block of individual income protection business originally ceded to Centre Life Reinsurance Ltd. in 1996 by Unum Life Insurance Company of America increased premium income by $24.5 million in the third quarter of 2005. Segment results were not materially impacted in the third quarter of 2005 from this recapture.
 
The Other segment reported operating income of $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $11.7 million in the third quarter of 2004.
 
The Corporate segment, which includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, and certain other corporate expenses, reported a loss of $33.0 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to a loss of $44.8 million in the third quarter of 2004, with the improvement partially attributable to a lower level of debt and reduced interest expense.
 
The Company's average number of shares outstanding used to calculate the per diluted common share results was 314,648,128 for the third quarter of 2005, compared to 303,628,576 for the third quarter of 2004.
 
Book value per common share at September 30, 2005 was $24.29, compared to $23.27 at September 30, 2004.
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in the business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions
regarding the Company's underlying business. The Company believes that exclusion of the charges related to the California settlement agreement and related matters, the gain on the sale of the Netherlands branch, and the income tax benefit related to the finalization of income tax reviews of the Company's U.K. subsidiaries enhances the understanding and comparability of the Company's performance, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recaptured its closed block individual income protection business originally ceded to Centre Life Reinsurance Ltd. in 1996. The recaptured business includes approximately $1.6 billion in invested assets and $185.0 million of annual premium. The effective date of the recapture was August 8, 2005. The underlying operating results of the reinsurance contract, prior to recapture, were reflected in other income. The recapture therefore did not have a material impact on operating income for the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment.
 
In July 2005, Unum Limited completed the sale of its Netherlands branch. The gain on the sale was $5.7 million before tax and $4.0 million after tax and is included in the operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005.
 
In the third quarter of 2005, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $10.8 million related to the finalization of income tax reviews of the Company's U.K. subsidiaries.
 
1st Quarter
 
In April 2005, the Internal Revenue Service completed its examination of tax years 1999 through 2001 and issued its revenue agent's report (RAR). Income tax liabilities of $32.0 million that relate primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of 2005, all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense.
 
2004 Offering
 
In May 2004, the Company issued 12,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) in a private offering for $300.0 million. The Company subsequently registered the privately placed securities for resale by the private investors. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on May 15, 2007 and (b) a 1/40 or 2.5% ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2009 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $300.0 million and will issue between 17.7 million and 20.4 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common shares - assuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $16.95 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. The impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common shares - assuming dilution, including the 2003 unit offering (see "2003 Public Offerings" discussion following), at various quarterly average stock price levels is as follows:
 
 
2004 Other Items
 
4th Quarter
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, certain of the Company's insurance subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination led by Maine, Massachusetts, and Tennessee relating to disability claims handling practices. A total of 48 states and the District of Columbia are parties to the settlement agreements. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor, which had been conducting an inquiry relating to certain ERISA plans, is a party to the settlement agreements, and the New York Attorney General's Office, which had engaged in its own investigation of the Company's claims handling practices, notified the Company that it was in support of the settlement and was, therefore, closing its investigation on this issue.
 
The examination report did not make any findings of violations of law or market conduct regulations. However, the examination report did identify areas of concern. These became the focus of specific changes and enhancements to the Company's disability claims handling operations which are designed to assure each claim decision is made in a consistently high quality manner.
 
 
1st Quarter
 
In the first quarter of 2004, the Company restructured its individual income protection  closed block business wherein three of its insurance subsidiaries entered into reinsurance agreements to reinsure approximately 66.7 percent of potential future losses that occur above a specified retention limit. The individual income protection  closed block reserves in these three subsidiaries comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's overall retained risk in the closed block of individual income protection. The reinsurance agreements effectively provide approximately 60 percent reinsurance coverage for the Company's overall consolidated risk above the retention limit. The maximum risk limit for the reinsurer is approximately $783.0 million initially and grows to approximately $2.6 billion over time, after which any further losses will revert to the Company. These reinsurance transactions were effective as of April 1, 2004. The Company transferred cash equal to $521.6 million of reserves ceded in the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment plus an additional $185.8 million in cash for a before-tax prepaid cost of insurance which was deferred and is being amortized into earnings over the expected claim payment period covered under the Company's retention limit. The Company retained the higher yielding investments historically associated with these reserves and redeployed these investments to other lines of business.
