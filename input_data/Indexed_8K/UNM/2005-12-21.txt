Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
(a) On December 16, 2005, UnumProvident Corporation (the "Company") and Thomas R. Watjen, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Agreement"), which amended and restated Mr. Watjen's Employment Agreement dated as of March 31, 2003 (the "Prior Agreement"). The amendments to the Prior Agreement include, without limitation, (i) deletion of obsolete references to Mr. Watjen's former interim officer status and the transition period which ended in 2003, (ii) updating references to Mr. Watjen's salary to its 2005 level, (iii) establishing an annual target bonus opportunity of not less than 120% of base salary, (iv) deletion of references to a deferred compensation arrangement that has not been used, (v) deletion of references to specific perquisites, and instead providing that Mr. Watjen will participate in the fringe benefits program for senior executives, as may be amended from time to time by the Compensation Committee, (vi) removing notice of non-renewal of the agreement as a "good reason" trigger and adding, instead, a provision for severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment within two years after non-renewal of the Amended and Restated Agreement by the Company, (vii) changing the severance payment formula to include a calculation based on the average of Mr. Watjen's prior three years' annual bonuses, rather than his highest annual bonus paid in the prior three years, (viii) changing the calculation of the retirement benefit portion of the severance payment to include credit for three additional years of age as well as service, (ix) providing for a lump sum payment of severance benefits rather than payment over 18 months, with the intention of satisfying the short-term deferral exemption from Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A"), and making certain other adjustments intended to comply with or qualify for an exemption under Section 409A, (x) providing for partial vesting of equity awards upon termination of employment absent a change in control, (xi) clarifying certain ambiguities and providing appropriate remedies with respect to the restrictive covenants, (xii) adjustments to the calculation of the retirement benefit under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan with respect to amounts vesting after December 31, 2004 to exclude the offset for social security benefits and to impose a six-month delay in payment as required by Section 409A, and (xiii) adjustments to the dispute resolution provisions.
 
A copy of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Mr. Watjen is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(b) The Employment Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2005, between the Company and Joseph M. Zubretsky, Senior Executive Vice President of Finance, Investments and Corporate Development, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on March 7, 2005, contains certain automatic adjustments triggered by corresponding changes to the Chief Executive Officer's employment agreement as described above. Specifically, upon the effective date of Mr. Watjen's Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, December 16, 2005, Mr. Zubretsky's Employment Agreement was automatically adjusted to (i) cause the severance payment formula to include a calculation based on the average of Mr. Zubretsky's prior three years' annual bonuses, rather than his highest annual bonus paid in the prior three years, and (ii) cause the calculation of the retirement benefit portion of the severance payment to include credit for three additional years of age as well as service. On December 21, 2005, the Company issued a letter to Mr. Zubretsky confirming the effect of the amendments to Mr. Watjen's Employment Agreement on those calculations in Mr. Zubretsky's Employment Agreement. A copy of the letter to Mr. Zubretsky is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Except as provided in this Section 6, the Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.

the following has been moved to Section 10(d)
 
7. .
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
 
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment, benefit or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable, provided or to be provided, or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 7) (a "") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount (the "") that could be paid to the Executive such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount.

Excise Tax
Gross-Up Payment
Reduced Amount
 
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 7(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 7, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the Company's independent auditors or such other certified public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Executive as may be designated by the Company (the "") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 7, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5) days of the later of (i) the due date for the payment of any Excise Tax, and (ii) the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any final determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive except in the case of manifest error. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (""), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 7(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
Accounting Firm
Underpayment
 
(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
 
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
 
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
 
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
 
(iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
 
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed
 
to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
 
(d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 7(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon by the IRS after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 7(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

The Executive further recognizes and acknowledges that all confidential information is the exclusive property of the Company, is material and confidential, and is critical to the successful conduct of the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive hereby covenants and agrees that he will use confidential information for the benefit of the Company only and shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, during the Agreement Term and thereafter, divulge, reveal or communicate any confidential information to any person, firm, corporation or entity whatsoever, or use any confidential information for his own benefit or for the benefit of others, other than as required by law or legal process.

The Executive further agrees that he shall not, in any equity proceeding relating to the enforcement of the terms of this Section 8, raise the defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Executive violates Section 8(a) or has knowledge of the conduct that results in a violation of Section 8(b) (any such violation being a "Forfeiture Event"), then all of the Executive's outstanding equity awards shall terminate and cease to be exercisable as of that date and the Executive shall remit to the Company, in cash, an amount equal to the income recognized by the Executive on the exercise of any stock options during the 90-day period prior to such Forfeiture Event. In addition, if the Executive violates Section 8(a), then, in lieu of any other monetary damages other than the forfeiture of option gains described in the immediately preceding sentence, the Executive shall remit to the Company, in cash, the lump sum payment made to him under Section 4(a)(i) or Section 4(d) (excluding accrued Annual Base Salary earned through the Date of Termination).
 
(f) The terms and provisions of this Section 8 are intended to be separate and divisible provisions and if, for any reason, any one or more of them is held to be invalid or unenforceable, neither the validity nor the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall thereby be affected. The parties hereto acknowledge that the potential restrictions on the Executive's future employment imposed by this Section 8 are reasonable in both duration and geographic scope and in all other respects.
 
If for any reason any court of competent jurisdiction shall find any provisions of this Section 8 unreasonable in duration or geographic scope or otherwise, the Executive and the Company agree that the restrictions and prohibitions contained herein shall be effective to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
 
(g) The parties acknowledge that this Agreement would not have been entered into and the benefits described in Sections 2 or 4 would not have been promised in the absence of the Executive's promises under this Section 8.

Joseph M. Zubretsky
Louise Terrace Apartments # 309
316 Walnut Street
Chattanooga, TN 37402
 
Re: Employment Agreement dated March 1, 2005 between Joseph M. Zubrestky ("Employment Agreement") and UnumProvident Corporation
 
Dear Joe:
 
This letter is to notify you of and confirm changes in the calculation of certain benefits under the Employment Agreement. Paragraph 8(a) of the Employment Agreement states:
 
"(i) the Company shall pay to Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days after the Date of Termination the aggregate of the following amounts:
 
 
(v) if the Date of Termination occurs during the CIC Period, the Company shall pay to Executive a lump sum cash payment equal to the difference between (A) the actuarial present value of the Retirement Benefit determined using the actuarial assumptions prescribed under the tax-qualified defined benefit plan under which the Executive was eligible for participation at the Date of Termination, assuming Executive had accumulated three (3) additional years of
employment (and if the CEO's Employment Agreement with the Company is hereafter amended to so provide, three (3) additional years of attained age), and (B) the actuarial present value of the Retirement Benefit determined using the actuarial assumptions prescribed under the tax-qualified defined benefit plan under which Executive was eligible for participation at the Date of termination; and"
 
Effective December 16, 2005, the CEO's Employment Agreement referred to in your Employment Agreement was amended to change the severance payment formula to include a calculation based on the average of Mr. Watjen's prior three years' annual bonuses rather than his highest annual bonus paid in the prior three years, and to change the calculation of the retirement benefit portion of the severance payment to include credit for an additional three years of age as well as service. Therefore, calculations under the respective provisions of Paragraph 8(a)(1)(A) and 8(a)(v) effective December 16, 2005 will reflect these amendments.
 
Please contact me if you have any questions.
 
Sincerely,
