EXHIBIT
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) announced today its results for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
The Company reported net income of $137.5 million ($0.43 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $134.5 million ($0.45 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2004. Included in the results for the fourth quarter of 2005 are net realized after tax investment gains of $1.5 million, compared to net realized after tax investment gains of $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Income excluding net realized after tax investment gains and losses was $136.0 million ($0.43 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $117.7 million ($0.39 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2004. (See discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliation below.)
 
The income excluding net realized after tax investment gains and losses of $117.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 includes a charge of $87.8 million after tax ($0.29 per diluted common share) related to the settlement of the multistate market conduct examination and income of $51.1 million after tax ($0.17 per diluted common share) attributable to settlements with the Internal Revenue Service.
 
Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer, said, "Although our results this quarter were slightly below our expectations, most of our businesses and product lines are performing well. The results
from our U.S. Brokerage - group income protection line were disappointing, but we have made organizational changes and are taking other actions to restore this business to appropriate levels of profitability. This underperformance does not cause us to change our long-term financial goals, though we do expect a slower rate of earnings growth in 2006 as a result. Looking back on 2005, I am very encouraged by the significant progress we made in many areas of the Company and while challenges remain, our confidence in our future is growing."
 
Results by Segment
 
In the following discussions of the Company's segment operating results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
The U.S. Brokerage segment reported operating income of $103.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Excluding the reserve charge of $80.8 million and operating expense charge of $37.6 million related to the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements, operating income in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $134.1 million.
 
Within this segment, the U.S. Brokerage group income protection line of business reported operating income of $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to an operating loss of $88.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, which included a reserve charge of $80.2 million and operating expense charge of $36.5 million related to the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements. Excluding these charges, operating income was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, the results for the fourth quarter of 2004 include $9.9 million in increased net investment income due to the periodic adjustment of amortization on mortgage-backed securities. The benefit ratio for group income protection was 93.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to 92.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, excluding the impact of the charge related to the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements. Claim recoveries and the timing of claim decisions continued to be adversely impacted by the implementation of organizational and procedural changes. Claim incidence trends on a submitted basis in the Company's group long-term income protection line in the fourth quarter of 2005 were slightly lower compared with the third quarter of 2005 and with the levels of the year ago quarter. Premium income in group income protection declined 4.0 percent to $629.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $656.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, reflecting lower sales in recent quarters as the Company has focused on improving the profitability of the business. Sales of fully insured group long-term income protection products in the fourth quarter of 2005 declined 14.7 percent to $68.1 million, compared to $79.8 million in the year ago quarter, and sales of fully insured group short-term income protection products in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased
14.0 percent to $32.6 million, compared to $28.6 million in the year ago quarter. For both of these lines, sales in the core small and mid-sized markets improved significantly relative to the year ago quarter while sales in the large case market declined. Premium persistency in the group long-term income protection line of business was 84.8 percent for both the full year 2005 and 2004.
 
The U.S. Brokerage segment's group life and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business reported operating income of $43.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to operating income of $62.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decline in earnings primarily reflects a decline in revenue in both the group life and AD&D lines and a higher benefit ratio in the AD&D line. The benefit ratio in the group life line in the fourth quarter of 2005 was stable relative to the fourth quarter of 2004. Premium income for these lines of business declined 8.3 percent to $366.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $399.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, reflecting lower sales and persistency in recent quarters as the Company has focused on improving the profitability of the business in a competitive market environment. Sales of group life products in the fourth quarter of 2005 declined 7.8 percent to $64.2 million, compared to $69.6 million in the year ago quarter, with a decline in large case sales offsetting increased sales in the core small and mid-sized markets. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 78.3 percent for the full year 2005, compared to 84.0 percent for full year 2004. The decline in persistency was due to higher terminations of some larger cases which had been targeted for significant rate increases.
 
Also within this segment, the U.S. Brokerage supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported operating income of $46.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $42.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Excluding the reserve charges of $0.6 million and operating expense charges of $1.1 million related to the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements, operating income in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $43.9 million. The improvement in earnings is primarily driven by improved results in the individual income protection  recently issued and long-term care lines of business. Premium income increased 6.6 percent to $313.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $293.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. New annualized sales in the voluntary workplace benefits line of business increased 4.2 percent and individual income protection  recently issued sales increased 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 relative to the fourth quarter of 2004, while long-term care sales declined 15.2 percent compared with the year ago quarter.
 
The Unum Limited segment reported operating income of $49.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $46.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating income in this segment benefited from strong premium growth, a slightly lower benefit ratio resulting from favorable claims management results, and a lower expense ratio relative to the year ago quarter. Premium income for this segment increased 12.0 percent to $198.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $177.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. New annualized sales in this segment declined 35.0 percent to $24.9 million in the fourth quarter of
2005 from $38.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 due primarily to higher sales during 2004 that resulted from the exit of a major insurer from the U.K. market and due to the competitive environment in the U.K. for group life products and the Company's decision to maintain its pricing discipline.
 
The Colonial segment reported operating income of $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $40.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Results in this segment in the fourth quarter of 2005 were negatively impacted by $6.8 million due to litigation costs. Premium income for this segment increased 5.8 percent to $200.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $189.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. New annualized sales in this segment increased 5.3 percent to $97.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 from $92.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
The Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to income of $37.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Excluding the reserve charge of $3.7 million and operating expense charge of $4.9 million related to the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements, operating income in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $46.4 million. The decline in income is primarily due to the periodic adjustment of amortization on mortgage-backed securities which increased net investment income by $13.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Claim incidence trends were generally stable with the levels of the prior quarter and year ago quarter; however, claim recovery experience was generally lower than the experience of the prior quarter and year ago quarter.
 
The Other segment reported operating income of $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
The Corporate segment, which includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, and certain other corporate expenses, reported a loss of $43.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to a loss of $31.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Included in the fourth quarter of 2004 was income of $14.0 million before tax attributable to the interest portion of settlements with the Internal Revenue Service which entitled the Company to a refund of tax plus interest.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded an expense of $9.1 million before tax, or $5.9 million after tax ($0.02 per diluted common share), reflecting a termination fee paid to exit an existing contract with an information technology provider. The Company has entered into an agreement with a new provider which is expected to result in a significantly less costly infrastructure. This fourth quarter expense is reflected primarily in the operating expenses of the U.S. Brokerage and Colonial segments.
 
Also during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized tax benefits related to U.K. repatriated dividends and group tax relief of $8.8 million ($0.03 per diluted common share).
The Company's average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution, was 318,681,427 for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to 302,248,001 for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Book value per common share at December 31, 2005 was $24.66, compared to $24.36 at December 31, 2004. Excluding the net unrealized gain on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at December 31, 2005 was $20.26, compared to $19.15 at December 31, 2004.
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in the business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate dependent on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. The Company also believes that exclusion of charges such as those related to the multistate settlement agreements enhances the understanding and comparability of the Company's performance, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

2004 Other Items
 
4th Quarter
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, certain of the Company's insurance subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination led by Maine, Massachusetts, and Tennessee relating to disability claims handling practices. A total of 48 states and the District of Columbia are parties to the settlement agreements. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor, which had been conducting an inquiry relating to certain ERISA plans, is a party to the settlement agreements, and the New York Attorney General's Office, which had engaged in its own investigation of the Company's claims handling practices, notified the Company that it was in support of the settlement and was, therefore, closing its investigation on this issue.
 
The examination report did not make any findings of violations of law or market conduct regulations. However, the examination report did identify areas of concern. These became the focus of specific changes and enhancements to the Company's disability claims handling operations which are designed to assure each claim decision is made in a consistently high quality manner.
 
The primary components of the settlement agreements include:
 
 
 
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a loss of $127.0 million before tax, or $87.8 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $27.5 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the two-year reassessment process; $44.0 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $40.5 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $15.0 million fine. The ongoing costs of changes in the claims handling process and governance improvements will be included in the Company's operating expenses as incurred going forward. These ongoing costs are not anticipated to materially affect the Company's results of operations.
 
 
 
In June 2004, the Company amended its postretirement medical plan and as a result of this amendment, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of $9.4 million before tax in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Also during the second quarter of 2004, the Company closed the sale of its Canadian operations and reported a loss of $113.0 million before tax and $70.9 million after tax on the sale of the branch. Assets transferred to the buyer included available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $1,099.4 million and a book value of $957.7 million. Liabilities transferred included reserves of $1,254.8 million. The Company retained a portion of the Canadian branch fixed maturity bond portfolio according to the terms of the transaction. The bonds retained had a fair value, at April 30, 2004, of $732.9 million and a yield of 7.14 percent. These investments, which were redeployed to other lines of business during the remainder of the year, added approximately four basis points to the investment portfolio yield rate, at April 30, 2004, in the Company's continuing operations.
 
1st Quarter
 
In the first quarter of 2004, the Company restructured its individual income protection  closed block business wherein three of its insurance subsidiaries entered into reinsurance agreements to reinsure approximately 66.7 percent of potential future losses that occur above a specified retention limit. The individual income protection  closed block reserves in these three subsidiaries comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's overall retained risk in the closed block of individual income protection. The reinsurance agreements effectively provide approximately 60 percent reinsurance coverage for the Company's overall consolidated risk above the retention limit. The maximum risk limit for the reinsurer is approximately $783.0 million initially and grows to approximately $2.6 billion over time, after which any further losses will revert to the Company. These reinsurance transactions were effective as of April 1, 2004. The Company transferred cash equal to $521.6 million of reserves ceded in the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment plus an additional $185.8 million in cash for a before-tax prepaid cost of insurance which was deferred and is being amortized into earnings over the expected claim payment period covered under the Company's retention limit. The Company retained the higher yielding investments historically associated with these reserves and redeployed these investments to other lines of business.
 
In conjunction with the restructuring of the individual income protection  closed block business, effective January 1, 2004, the Company modified its reporting segments to include a separate segment for this business. The reporting, monitoring, and management of the closed block of individual income protection business as a discrete segment is consistent with the Company's financial restructuring and separation of this business from the lines of business which actively market new products. In the past, this business had been reported in the Income Protection segment. Prior to 2004, detailed separate financial metrics and models were unavailable to appropriately manage this block of business separately from the recently issued individual income protection block of business.
 
The change in the Company's reporting segments required the Company to perform, separately for the individual income protection  closed block business and individual income protection  recently issued business, impairment testing for goodwill and loss recognition testing for the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired. As required under GAAP, prior to the change in reporting segments, these tests were performed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. The testing indicated impairment of the individual income protection  closed block deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired, and goodwill balances of $282.2 million, $367.1 million, and $207.1 million, respectively. These impairment charges, $856.4 million before tax and $629.1 million after tax, are included in the net loss reported for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Also as part of the restructuring, the Company analyzed the reserve assumptions related to its individual income protection  closed block reserves as a stand-alone segment. Previously these reserves were analyzed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. Included in the analysis was a review of morbidity assumptions, primarily claim resolution rates, and claim reserve discount rate assumptions. Based upon this analysis, the Company lowered the claim reserve discount rate to reflect the segmentation of assets between the individual income protection  recently issued business and the individual income protection  closed block business, the change in the Company's investment portfolio yield rates during the first quarter of 2004, the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates, and the Company's desire to maintain the relationship between the claim reserve discount rate and the investment portfolio yield rate for the individual income protection  closed block at the Company's long-term objective. The segmentation of the investment portfolio was necessary to ensure appropriate matching of the duration of the assets and the related policy liabilities. Based on this analysis, in the first quarter of 2004 the Company increased its individual income protection  closed block claim reserves by $110.6 million before tax, or $71.9 million after tax, to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The first quarter 2004 change represented a 1.2 percent increase in total net Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment reserves as of March 31, 2004, which equaled $9.530 billion prior to this increase.
 
 
4th Quarter
 
Effective October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36), DIG Issue B36 addresses financial accounting and reporting for embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance contracts that incorporate credit risk exposure unrelated to the credit risk of the counterparty to the reinsurance contract and requires the bifurcation of any such derivative from the host reinsurance contract. The Company has two reinsurance contracts for which DIG Issue B36 is applicable. The adoption of DIG Issue B36 resulted in an increase in fixed maturity securities of $61.3 million to record the fair value of the embedded derivatives and a $39.9 million cumulative effect of accounting principle change, net of $21.4 million in tax.
Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposure That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments.
 
Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 (Interpretation 46), . Interpretation 46 expands upon ARB No. 51, , to address financial accounting and reporting for certain entities in which a controlling financial interest cannot be identified based on an evaluation of voting interests. Transition to the provisions of Interpretation 46 required the Company to consolidate four special purpose entities whose purposes are to support the Company's investment objectives. Prior to December 31, 2003, these entities were accounted for as fixed maturity securities in the available for sale portfolio and carried at fair value which was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. For these four entities, the adoption of Interpretation 46 had no impact on the fair value of total invested assets reported in the Company's consolidated statement of financial condition.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51
Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Adoption of Interpretation 46 also resulted in the de-consolidation of a trust that currently holds $300.0 million of junior subordinated debt securities of the Company and has issued a similar amount of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The impact of the de-consolidation was the elimination of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debt securities of the company included in the consolidated statement of financial condition and an increase of $300.0 million in long-term debt.
 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, , and selected the prospective method of adoption allowed under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, . The adoption decreased after tax results for 2003 approximately $0.6 million.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure
 
 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued a total of 52,877,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, related to a public offering and received approximately $547.7 million in proceeds. In addition, the Company issued a total of 23,000,000 8.25% adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) related to a public offering for $575.0 million. Each unit has a stated amount of $25 and will initially consist of (a) a contract pursuant to which the holder agrees to purchase, for $25, shares of the Company's common stock on May 15, 2006 and (b) a 1/40, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due May 15, 2008 with a principal amount of $1,000. Upon settlement of the common stock purchase contract and successful remarketing of the senior note element of the units, the Company will receive proceeds of approximately $575.0 million and will issue between 43.3 million and 52.9 million shares of common stock. The purchase contract element of the units contributes to the number of quarterly weighted average common shares - assuming dilution when the average market price of the Company's common stock is greater than the threshold appreciation price of $13.27 per share and the Company has income from continuing operations. See "2004 Offering" discussion preceding for the impact of the purchase contract element of the units on the number of quarterly weighted average common shares-assuming dilution at various quarterly average stock price levels.
 
2003 Other Items
 
4th Quarter
 
Included in the fourth quarter of 2003 results is an after tax increase in U.S. Brokerage group income protection reserves of $286.0 million, or $440.0 million before tax. In January 2004, the Company completed its annual review of claim reserves to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses. Approximately $300.0 million of the reserve strengthening reflects implementation of a lower discount rate for its U.S. Brokerage group income protection claim reserves. The discount rate was lowered to reflect the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates and the Company's new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate. The Company's new discount rate management approach is intended to better reflect the current investment environment and position the Company to be more responsive with discount rates on new incurred claims as changes to the investment environment emerge. Approximately $140.0 million of the reserve increase relates to a strengthening of the morbidity assumptions to reflect the impact of the continuing weak economic cycle on claim incidence and severity. Claim incidence in the second half of 2003 was 8 percent higher than the first half of the year and 5 percent above the second half of 2002. Increased claim incidence is expected to continue at an elevated level for several quarters as the early indications of a recovering economy are not yet reflected in improved consumer confidence or job creation. The reserve increase represents a 6.6 percent increase in total net U.S. Brokerage group income protection reserves as of December 31, 2003, which were $6.674 billion prior to this increase.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Canadian branch and expects the transaction to close during the first half of 2004. The Canadian branch is accounted for as "held for sale" at December 31, 2003 and also meets the accounting criteria for being reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with the classification of the Canadian branch as held for sale, the Company tested the goodwill related to the Canadian branch for impairment and determined that the balance of $190.9 million was impaired. The Company also recognized a loss of $9.3 million before tax and $6.0 million after tax to write down the value of bonds in the Canadian branch investment portfolio to market value. These two charges, $200.2 million before and $196.9 million after tax, are included in the loss from discontinued operations.
 
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized losses of $14.7 million before tax and $5.3 million after tax related to its Japan and Argentina operations, which are accounted for as "held for sale" assets and as such must be reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Because the Company intends to have a continuing presence in each of these operations, they are not considered discontinued operations.
 
 
Included in the net loss for the first quarter of 2003 is an increase in the Company's U.S. Brokerage group long-term income protection GAAP reserves of $454.0 million before tax, or $295.1 million after tax. In April of 2003, the Company completed an analysis of its assumptions related to its group long-term income protection claim reserves. This analysis was initiated based on a trend in lower net claim recovery rates observed during the first quarter of 2003. The claim recovery rates during the first quarter were below expected levels and were lower than those experienced in the past three years. The analysis of emerging net claim recovery rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the Company's long-term expectations. Based on the analysis noted above, the Company increased its U.S. Brokerage group long-term income protection claim reserves as of March 31, 2003 to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations. The analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim recovery rates, but a change in claim recovery rates by claim duration.
