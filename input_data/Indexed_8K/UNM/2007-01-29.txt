EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
Chattanooga, TN  UnumProvident Corporation (NYSE: UNM) announced today its results for the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company reported net income of $276.1 million ($0.80 per diluted common share), compared to net income of $137.5 million ($0.43 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2005.
Included in the results for the fourth quarter of 2006 is income of $93.9 million after tax ($0.27 per diluted common share) resulting from debt extinguishment costs of $1.9 million after tax, income of $3.9 million after tax attributable to the receipt of interest and tax refunds on prior year tax items in excess of what was previously provided, and an income tax benefit of approximately $91.9 million primarily as the result of group relief benefits obtained from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in which the Company's businesses operate. Net income also includes net realized after tax investment gains of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Additionally, the Company has entered into an agreement to sell GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX). GENEX is therefore accounted for as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2006 and reported as a discontinued operation.
Adjusting for these items, income from continuing operations on an after tax basis (excluding the net realized investment gains, special tax items, and debt extinguishment costs) was $179.8 million ($0.52 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $133.3 million ($0.42 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2005. (See discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliation below.)
Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer, said, "I am very pleased with our fourth quarter results. We saw strong earnings across all of our business segments, including the Unum US group income protection line of business, which has lagged the performance of our other businesses. Though we benefited from better than expected net investment income and results in Unum UK, as well as several other items, adjusting for these items we still exceeded the consensus estimate and our own internal plans. We are maintaining the guidance we communicated at our November 2006 Investor Day meeting, and our confidence in achieving these targets continues to grow."
The Company also announced today that Kevin P. McCarthy has been named president of the Unum US operating unit and Robert O. Best will become its chief operating officer. McCarthy formerly served as executive vice president of risk operations for what is now called Unum US while Best was most recently executive vice president of service operations and chief information officer. President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Watjen stated, "Kevin has been instrumental in helping to strengthen the Company operationally and financially in recent years and in better positioning our Unum US operations for the future. I'm confident that he and Bob will provide the leadership required to help us build on the momentum we have created the past several years."
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
As a part of a broader branding initiative, the Company announced its intention to change its name from UnumProvident Corporation to Unum Group. While this change is pending required legal approvals, the Company has changed its operating segment names as a part of this branding initiative. As a result, the U.S. Brokerage segment has been renamed Unum US and the Unum Limited segment has been renamed Unum UK. The results of GENEX, which were previously included in the Other segment, are now reported as discontinued operations and excluded from segment results for all periods.
In the following discussions of the Company's segment operating results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.

Premium income in group income protection declined 0.7 percent to $625.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $629.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, due to a more disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Net investment income was $168.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $152.3 million in the same period last year, reflecting a higher level of bond call prepayment fees in the current quarter.

Operating income also benefited from higher net investment income and a favorable year over year foreign currency exchange rate. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of 2006 was higher than the year ago quarter reflecting the acceleration of amortization due to the run-off of a small in-force block of individual business. Premium income increased 16.5 percent to $231.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $198.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.

OTHER INFORMATION
Sale of GENEX Services, Inc.
On January 24, 2007 the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, GENEX, to Trident IV, L.P., a fund managed by Stone Point Capital LLC. The sale reflects the Company's strategy to focus on its core business areas and deploy its capital to the growth of these business lines. The sale is looked upon as a favorable event for both entities as it will allow GENEX to create its own growth strategy to further build its workers' compensation business. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2007.
 
Shares Outstanding
The Company's average number of shares (000s) outstanding, assuming dilution was 345,527.8 for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to 318,681.4 for the fourth quarter of 2005.
Book Value
Book value per common share at December 31, 2006 was $22.53, compared to $24.66 at December 31, 2005. Excluding the net unrealized gain on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at December 31, 2006 was $20.40 compared to $20.26 at December 31, 2005.
OUTLOOK
The Company is reaffirming its 2007 operating earnings per share guidance of $1.83 to $1.87 based on the current business trends and its expectations for 2007, which includes an improvement in the benefit ratio for the Unum US group income protection line to within a range of 90 percent to 92 percent by the end of the year.
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, and excluding certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in the business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business. The exclusion of certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation also enhances the understanding and comparability of the Company's performance and the underlying fundamentals in its operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate dependent on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

The increase in the Unum US segment and Individual Income ProtectionClosed Block segment IBNR from December 31, 2005 is due to the 2006 revised claim reassessment reserve estimates related to the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreement and California settlement agreement. The increase in Unum US IBNR is offset in part due to a slight decline in insured lives in the group income protection, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business.
The increase in Unum US Policy and Claim Reserves Incurred from December 31, 2005 is due to growth in the disabled life reserves in the Unum US group income protection line of business and growth in the active life reserves for the Unum US long-term care and individual income protection - recently issued lines of business.
The increase in Policy and Claim Reserves Incurred from December 31, 2005 for the Unum UK segment is due primarily to growth in insured lives and fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate.
The unrealized adjustment to reserves to reflect the changes that would be necessary to policyholder liabilities if the unrealized gains and losses related to our available-for-sale securities had been realized decreased Policy Reserves approximately $158.2 million during 2006, primarily in the Unum US group income protection line of business and the Individual Income Protection - Closed Block segment.
