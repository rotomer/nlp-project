Adjusting for these items, income from continuing operations on an after-tax basis was $174.6 million ($0.50 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $129.2 million ($0.40 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2006.
Commenting on Unum's results, Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer, said, "Overall, we had a very solid quarter and a strong start to 2007. I am particularly encouraged by the continued improvement in our Unum US group income protection line of business and am once again pleased with the excellent results from our Unum UK and Colonial subsidiaries."
"Our focus continues to be on enhancing our long-term capital management strategy, improving profit margins in those areas not meeting our expectations, and positioning our businesses to grow in a profitable, disciplined manner. I am pleased with many of the activities currently underway that will help position us for future growth. Our focus on product and service innovation, as evidenced by our new Simply Unum offering, and our expanded marketing focus, including the successful launch of our new brand, are important elements of our growth strategy. Our confidence in our future continues to grow as evidenced by the upward revision in our guidance for 2007 operating earnings to a range of $1.91 to $1.95 per share from our previous guidance of $1.83 to $1.87."

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
On March 2, 2007, the Company formally announced its name change from "UnumProvident Corporation" to "Unum Group," and as of that date shares of the Company have been trading under the Unum Group name. As previously noted, the Company renamed its principle operating segments as part of its current rebranding process. The Company's three primary operating segments are Unum US (formerly U.S. Brokerage), Unum UK (formerly Unum Limited), and Colonial.
In the following discussions of the Company's operating segment results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
Unum US Segment
Unum US reported operating income of $142.4 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to income of $28.5 million in the first quarter of 2006. The year ago results for this segment included the before-tax claim reassessment charge of $72.8 million. Excluding this charge, the first quarter of 2006 operating income was $101.3 million. Premium income declined 4.5 percent to $1,244.9 million in the first quarter of 2007 from $1,303.8 million in the first quarter of 2006.
Within this segment, the group income protection line of business reported operating income of $28.7 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to a loss of $71.6 million in the first quarter of 2006. The results for the year ago quarter

include the reassessment charge of $72.8 million. The benefit ratio for the quarter was 93.4 percent compared to 95.5 percent in the first quarter 2006, excluding the impact of the reassessment charge, and 94.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company continued to experience improvements in its claims management and also experienced slightly lower new claim incidence in its group long-term income protection line of business during the first quarter of 2007. Premium income in group income protection declined 4.8 percent to $590.1 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $619.8 million in the first quarter of 2006. The decline is attributable, in part, to the Company's disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of fully insured group long-term income protection products in the first quarter of 2007 declined by 40.8 percent to $25.5 million, compared to $43.1 million in the year ago quarter. Sales of fully insured group short-term income protection products in the first quarter of 2007 increased 26.7 percent to $15.2 million, compared to $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2006. Premium persistency in the group long-term income protection line of business was 84.6 percent for first quarter of 2007, compared to 86.6 percent in the first quarter of 2006, primarily reflecting lower persistency in the Company's large case business. Case persistency for this line was 87.6 percent in the first quarter of 2007, compared to 87.5 percent in the year ago quarter. Premium persistency in the group short-term income protection line of business declined to 75.1 percent for first quarter of 2007 compared to 81.9 percent for first quarter of 2006, while case persistency was relatively stable at 85.8 percent for the first quarter of 2007 compared to 85.7 percent in the year ago quarter.

Group life and accidental death and dismemberment reported a 12.5 percent increase in operating income to $49.4 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $43.9 million in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting favorable mortality trends. Premium income declined 12.7 percent to $313.2 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $358.8 million in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting the Company's disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of group life products in the first quarter of 2007 declined 39.5 percent to $20.1 million, compared to $33.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 78.1 percent in the first quarter of 2007, compared to 79.1 percent in the year ago quarter. Case persistency was 85.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007, compared to 86.4 percent in the year ago quarter.
The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 14.4 percent increase in operating income to $64.3 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $56.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. The improvement in earnings was driven by improved results in the performance of the individual income protection  recently issued and voluntary workplace benefits lines of business, which offset lower earnings in the long-term care line of business. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 5.0 percent to $341.6 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $325.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. Sales in the voluntary workplace benefits line of business declined 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006, while sales in the individual income protection  recently issued line increased 17.9 percent and long-term care sales increased 24.2 percent compared with the year ago quarter.

Unum UK Segment
Unum UK reported operating income of $75.1 million in the first quarter of 2007, a 38.1 percent increase, compared to $54.4 million in the first quarter of 2006. Operating income benefited from a decline in the benefit ratio to 61.1 percent in the first quarter of 2007 compared to 67.5 percent in the first quarter of 2006, resulting in large part from lower claim incidence in the group long-term income protection line. Operating income also benefited from the continued favorable year over year foreign currency exchange rate. In local currency, operating income for the first quarter of 2007 increased 23.5 percent from the first quarter of 2006. Premium income increased 16.1 percent to $222.3 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $191.4 million in the first quarter of 2006. In local currency, premium income increased 4.1 percent compared to the first quarter of 2006. Sales increased 77.8 percent to $20.8 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2006. In local currency, sales for the quarter increased 58.2 percent compared to the first quarter of 2006.
Colonial Segment
Colonial reported a 29.0 percent increase in operating income to $59.6 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $46.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. Results in the first quarter of 2007 were driven by favorable claims experience. The benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2007 was 49.2 percent,
 
UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES.
 
compared to 52.1 percent for the same period in 2006. Premium income increased to $223.4 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $202.6 million in the first quarter of 2006. Sales increased slightly to $67.6 million in the first quarter of 2007 from $67.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. New account growth of 8.0 percent in the quarter was largely offset by a reduction in the average new case size. For the first quarter of 2007, new agent contracts increased 12.9 percent. Average weekly producers for the first quarter of 2007 declined slightly compared to the first quarter of 2006, while average weekly premium per agent increased 0.9 percent.
Individual Income Protection  Closed Block Segment
The Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $22.5 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $14.7 million in the first quarter of 2006. Results in the year ago quarter included the before-tax claim reassessment charge of $13.2 million. The interest adjusted loss ratio increased to 93.9 percent in the first quarter of 2007 compared to 91.6 percent in the first quarter of 2006, excluding the impact of the claim reassessment charge, due primarily to an increase in benefit payments which were partially offset by a higher rate of claim recoveries.
Other Segment
The Other segment reported operating income of $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting the continued wind down of product lines that are no longer actively marketed.

Accounting Pronouncements
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Position 05-1 (SOP 05-1), , which provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts, and FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), , which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements.

Book Value
Book value per common share as of March 31, 2007 was $21.52, compared to $21.94 at March 31, 2006. Excluding the net unrealized gain on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at March 31, 2007 was $19.56, compared to $20.40 at March 31, 2006.
OUTLOOK

remainder of the year. Incorporated in the Company's estimates is continued improvement in the benefit ratio for the Unum US group income protection line to within its previously stated target range of 90.0 percent to 92.0 percent by the end of 2007. Additionally, the Company is revising upward its guidance for the 2007 return on equity for its three primary operating segments to a range of 13.1 percent to 13.4 percent from previous guidance of 11.9 percent, and for its total Company to a range of 9.7 percent to 9.9 percent from previous guidance of a range of 9.0 percent to 9.5 percent.
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, and excluding certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business. The exclusion of certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation also enhances the understanding and comparability of the Company's performance and the underlying fundamentals in its operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate dependent on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

The decrease in the Unum US segment and Individual Income Protection - Closed Block segment IBNR from December 31, 2006 is due to the release of reserves to cover costs for the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements and the California settlement agreement and related matters and a slight decline in insured lives in the group income protection, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business.
The increase in Unum US Policy and Claim Reserves Incurred from December 31, 2006 is due to growth in the disabled life reserves in the Unum US group income protection line of business and growth in the active life reserves for the Unum US long-term care and individual income protection - recently issued lines of business.
