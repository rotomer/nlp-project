CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (August 1, 2007)
Included in the results for the second quarter of 2007 is a net increase in the provision for the cost related to the claim reassessment process of $53.0 million before tax, or $34.5 million after tax ($0.10 per diluted common share), to reflect the Company's revised estimate of benefit costs and operating expenses. Also included in the quarter results are net realized after-tax investment gains of

$6.5 million ($0.02 per diluted common share). For the comparable period in 2006, the net realized after-tax investment loss was $3.6 million ($0.01 per diluted common share). Additionally, results for the second quarter of 2006 included after-tax debt extinguishment costs of $11.6 million ($0.04 per diluted common share) and income of $1.9 million ($0.01 per diluted common share) from discontinued operations.
Adjusting for these items, income from continuing operations on an after-tax basis was $181.5 million ($0.51 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $138.5 million ($0.42 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2006.
Commenting on the quarter, Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer, stated, "We had very solid operating results in the quarter, highlighted by record quarterly income at Colonial, continued high level of performance at Unum UK, and continued improvement in Unum US, particularly within the group income protection line. I am particularly pleased with the continued consistency of performance across the Company and that we again exceeded expectations. Based on our results for the first half of 2007 and the momentum building around the Company, we have increased our full year 2007 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.01 to $2.04 per share."
"I am also very pleased with the progress we have made toward completing the claim reassessment process entered into as part of our past regulatory settlements. We now expect to substantially complete that process by the end of the third quarter  ahead of schedule. Although we have added to our reassessment reserve, it remains within our projected range."

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
In the following discussions of the Company's operating segment results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
Unum US Segment
Unum US reported operating income of $92.3 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to operating income of $104.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. Included in the results for the second quarter is an increase of $76.5 million related to the Company's revised estimates of the benefit costs for the claim reassessment process and the release of $10.3 million from the operating expense reserve related to the same, for a net reduction in operating income of $66.2 million. Excluding these impacts, operating income for the segment was $158.5 million.
Within this segment, the group income protection line of business reported an operating loss of $15.4 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to operating income of $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2006. The results for the current quarter include the revised cost estimates for the reassessment process described above, which resulted in a reduction
 
UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES.
 
to operating income of $66.2 million. Excluding these items, operating income for this line of business was $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2007. The benefit ratio for the second quarter of 2007 was 105.2 percent. Excluding the reassessment reserve revision, the benefit ratio for the second quarter of 2007 was 92.7 percent compared to 95.1 percent in the second quarter 2006 and 93.4 percent in the first quarter of 2007. The improvement in the benefit ratio was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims management and lower paid claims in both the group long-term and short-term income protection lines of business compared to the second quarter of 2006. Premium income in group income protection declined 2.2 percent to $609.3 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $622.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. The decline remains primarily attributable to the Company's disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of fully insured group long-term income protection products in the second quarter of 2007 increased by 4.1 percent to $53.0 million, compared to $50.9 million in the year ago quarter. Sales of fully insured group short-term income protection products declined by 13.8 percent to $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $18.8 million in the second quarter of 2006. Premium persistency in the group long-term income protection line of business was 83.9 percent through the second quarter of 2007, compared to 86.5 percent in the first six months of 2006. Case persistency for this line was 87.7 percent for the first six months of 2007, compared to 87.1 percent in the comparable year ago period. Premium persistency in the group short-term income protection line of business was 74.9 percent for the first six months
 
UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES.
 
of 2007 compared to 83.0 percent for the comparable period in 2006. Case persistency for the line was 86.6 percent for the first six months of 2007, compared to 85.6 percent in the first six months of 2006.
The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 15.0 percent increase in operating income to $51.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $44.8 million in the second quarter of 2006, reflecting a favorable incidence rate in group life which outweighed a higher level of incidence in the accidental death and dismemberment line. Premium income for this line of business declined 14.5 percent to $309.2 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $361.5 million in the second quarter of 2006, reflecting the Company's ongoing disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of group life products in the second quarter of 2007 declined 18.9 percent to $35.3 million compared to $43.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 78.3 percent in the first six months of 2007, compared to 79.9 percent for the comparable period in 2006. Case persistency for the first six months of 2007 and 2006 was 86.5 percent.
The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 14.0 percent increase in operating income to $56.2 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $49.3 million in the second quarter of 2006. The improvement in operating income was driven by favorable results in the performance of the individual income protection  recently issued and voluntary workplace benefits lines of business, which offset lower operating

income in the long-term care line of business. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 6.1 percent to $347.2 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $327.2 million in the second quarter of 2006. Sales in the voluntary workplace benefits line of business increased 10.9 percent in the second quarter of 2007, sales in the individual income protection  recently issued line increased 15.1 percent, and long-term care sales increased 30.6 percent compared with the year ago quarter.
Unum UK Segment
Unum UK reported operating income of $77.7 million in the second quarter of 2007, a 38.5 percent increase, compared to $56.1 million in the second quarter of 2006. Operating income benefited from a decline in the benefit ratio to 62.2 percent in the second quarter of 2007 compared to 68.7 percent in the second quarter of 2006, resulting primarily from lower claim incidence in the group long-term income protection line of business. In addition, favorable currency exchange rates continued to benefit reported results for the segment. In local currency, operating income for the second quarter of 2007 increased 27.4 percent from the second quarter of 2006. Premium income increased 23.1 percent to $247.0 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $200.7 million in the second quarter of 2006. In local currency, premium income increased 13.2 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006. Sales increased 39.0 percent to $27.8 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $20.0 million in the second quarter of 2006. In local currency, sales for the second quarter of 2007 increased 28.4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2006.

Colonial Segment
Colonial reported a 30.1 percent increase in operating income to $64.9 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $49.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. Results in the second quarter of 2007 were driven by continued favorable mortality experience in the life line of business and positive claims experience in the income protection line of business. The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2007 was 47.2 percent, compared to 52.7 percent for the same period in 2006. During the second quarter, Colonial reached a milestone, having achieved one billion dollars in in-force premium. Premium income for the second quarter of 2007 increased to $224.8 million, compared to $209.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. Sales increased 7.5 percent to $78.6 million in the second quarter of 2007 from $73.1 million in the second quarter of 2006. New account growth was 12.0 percent in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006. However, average new case size continued to decline in year-over-year comparisons. Average weekly producers increased 5.1 percent in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006, while average weekly premium per agent increased 2.5 percent.
Individual Income Protection  Closed Block Segment
The Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $42.6 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $33.2 million in the second quarter of 2006. Results in the current

quarter include the above stated revision of the estimate for claim reassessment reserves. During the quarter, the previous estimates for benefit costs and operating expenses for the claim reassessment process in this segment were revised downward, resulting in a release of $10.7 million of benefit cost reserves and $2.5 million of operating expense reserves. These two adjustments increased operating income for this segment by $13.2 million. Excluding these impacts, operating income in this segment totaled $29.4 million in the second quarter of 2007. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 88.1 percent for the second quarter of 2007. Excluding the reassessment reserve revision, the ratio declined slightly to 92.4 percent in the second quarter of 2007 compared to 93.0 percent in the second quarter of 2006.
Other Segment
The Other segment reported operating income of $4.0 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $5.4 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Corporate Segment
The Corporate segment, which includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, and certain other corporate expenses, reported a loss of $59.0 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to a loss of $53.7 million in the second quarter of 2006. Included in this segment in the

second quarter of 2007 is a litigation settlement accrual totaling $11.6 million related to settlement of the federal securities law class action lawsuit. Interest and debt expense, including cost related to early retirement of debt, was $45.3 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $66.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. Included in debt costs for the second quarter of 2007 is $0.8 million related to early retirement of debt compared to $17.8 million in 2006.
OTHER INFORMATION
Revision to Claim Reassessment Cost
As of the end of the second quarter of 2007, the Company had completed the mailing of all of the required claim reassessment notices to claimants. Less than one percent of these individuals have unexpired time remaining to complete and return the necessary claim reassessment information forms. Therefore, 99 percent of the potential inventory of claim reassessment information forms have been returned to the Company, with the claim reassessment decisions completed on approximately 88 percent of the forms. The Company has not yet finalized its claim reassessment decisions on the remaining forms but has performed a financial review and included that information in its analysis of emerging experience. The Company now believes that it will substantially complete the claim reassessment process by the end of the third quarter of 2007 and does not anticipate further revisions to its provision.
 
UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES.
 
Because of an increase in the overturn rate, which was 48 percent for the second quarter of 2007 and was 45 percent for the first six months of 2007, as well as an increase in the average benefit cost per claim, the Company revised its assumptions and in the second quarter of 2007 increased its provision for the cost of the reassessment process by $53.0 million before tax, or $34.5 million after tax. This charge was within the Company's previously disclosed range of +/- $60.0 million for reasonably possible outcomes relative to its then best estimates.
Additional information regarding the second quarter revision to the Company's estimate is as follows:

Shares Outstanding
The Company's average number of shares (000s) outstanding, assuming dilution, was 354,837.4 for the second quarter of 2007, compared to 329,905.0 for the second quarter of 2006.
Book Value
Book value per common share as of June 30, 2007 was $20.43, compared to $20.40 at June 30, 2006. Excluding the net unrealized gain on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at June 30, 2007 was $19.84, compared to $19.85 at June 30, 2006.
OUTLOOK
The Company is revising upward its full year 2007 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.01 to $2.04 per share, excluding the claim reassessment charge, from previous guidance of $1.91 to $1.95 per share, based on the second quarter performance and current expectations for the remainder of the year. Incorporated in the Company's estimates is continued improvement in the benefit ratio for the Unum US group income protection line to within its previously stated guidance of a range of 90.0 percent to 92.0 percent by the end of 2007. Additionally, the Company is restating its guidance for the 2007 return on equity
 
UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES.
 
for its three primary operating segments to a range of 14.0 percent to 14.2 percent from previous guidance of a range of 13.1 percent to 13.4 percent, and for the total Company to a range of 10.2 percent to 10.3 percent from previous guidance of a range of 9.7 percent to 9.9 percent.
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, and excluding certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business. The exclusion of certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation also enhances the understanding and comparability of the Company's performance and the underlying fundamentals in its operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

The decrease in the Unum US segment and Individual Income Protection - Closed Block segment IBNR from December 31, 2006 is due to the release of reserves to cover costs for the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements and the California settlement agreement and related matters and a slight decline in insured lives in the group income protection, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business. Offsetting the release for Unum US group income protection is the second quarter of 2007 claim reassessment revision to increase reserves $76.5 million.
The increase in Unum US Policy and Claim Reserves Incurred from December 31, 2006 is due to growth in the disabled life reserves in the Unum US group income protection line of business and growth in the active life reserves for the Unum US long-term care and individual income protection - recently issued lines of business.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Company's performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income (loss). We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Company's underlying business. We also believe that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Company's performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
We have completed the mailing of all of the required claim reassessment notices. Individuals who want their claim reviewed have the opportunity to request a claim reassessment information form and have 60 days to complete and return the form to us once it is received. Less than one percent of the individuals have unexpired time remaining to complete and return the necessary claim reassessment information forms. Therefore, we have 99 percent of the potential inventory of claim reassessment information forms returned to us, with our claim reassessment on approximately 88 percent of the forms completed. We have not yet finalized our claim reassessment on the remaining forms but have performed a financial review and included that information in our analysis of emerging experience.
Based on the changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim, in the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax. This charge was within our previously disclosed range of +/- $60.0 million for reasonably possible outcomes relative to our then best estimates. We do not anticipate that we will need to further revise our provision for our claim reassessment costs. We expect to substantially complete our claim reassessment process by the end of the third quarter of 2007, and we anticipate that the regulatory examination of the claim reassessment process will be completed by mid-year 2008.
Additional information regarding the second quarter revision to our estimate is as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although unexpected unfavorable or favorable experience relative to our revised assumptions could result in actual claim reassessment costs above or below our current accrual, the effect on our financial position or results of operations is expected to be immaterial.
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX). Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations. The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%. We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired. The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax. In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock. We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
 
In the first and second quarters of 2007, we made principal payments of $10.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes due 2036 which were issued by Tailwind Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unum Group. During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015. The costs associated with these debt reductions decreased our second quarter and first six months 2007 income by approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.
Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Statement of Position 05-1 (SOP 05-1), . SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97, . The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of SOP 05-1 decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.

2006 Significant Transactions and Events
Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for the claim reassessment process. Our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of 2006, when actual results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the reassessment process. We concluded that a change in our initial assumptions, primarily related to the number of claimants for whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments, was warranted. We based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time, which was the actual cost related to approximately 20 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed. The characteristics, profile, and cost of those initial 20 percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in 2004 and 2005. Based on our analysis, in the first quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $86.0 million before tax, or $55.9 million after tax, to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment. The first quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US segment group income protection line of business $72.8 million and our Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment $13.2 million.
 
In the third quarter of 2006 we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process $325.4 million before tax and $211.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim. The revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately 55 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed. The third quarter charge was comprised of $310.4 million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and $15.0 million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the additional time now estimated to complete the process. Our best estimate of $310.4 million for the reopened claims assumed that the nature and characteristics of the approximately 45 percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the average profile of the 55 percent already reviewed at that time. The third quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US segment group income protection line of business $291.4 million and our Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment $34.0 million.
Broker Compensation Settlement
On October 31, 2006, we reached a settlement agreement on broker compensation with the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) that directly resolves all issues raised by the NYAG in its review of our broker compensation practices. The review was part of a larger investigation of broker compensation practices in the insurance industry. We also resolved litigation filed by the California Insurance Commissioner against our Company and other insurers regarding disclosure practices in broker compensation. We have agreed to eliminate all contingent compensation programs for our group product lines. Additionally, we are expanding our disclosure of broker compensation programs. We had previously taken a number of steps to enhance transparency by establishing, in March 2005, disclosure policies that provided customers with a means of obtaining information about the compensation paid to their brokers. As part of the settlement, we agreed to a fine of $1.9 million, the establishment of a fund of $15.5 million to provide restitution for any customer determined to be harmed by past practices, and certain other expenses approximating $1.1 million.
Income Tax
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded income of $2.6 million before tax and approximately $3.9 million after tax attributable to the receipt of interest and tax refunds on prior year tax items in excess of what was previously provided.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $91.9 million primarily as the result of group relief benefits obtained from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in which our businesses operate.
 
Financing
In the second quarter of 2006, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we purchased $50.0 million of our outstanding 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.625% notes due 2011. The cost of the cash tender offer decreased second quarter 2006 income by $17.8 million before tax, or $11.6 million after tax. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we purchased $32.0 million of our outstanding 6.850% notes due 2015 on the open market. The cost of the debt purchase decreased fourth quarter 2006 income by $2.7 million before tax, or $1.9 million after tax.
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the units issued in May 2003 occurred in February 2006, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $575.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2008 to 5.997%. We purchased $400.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired. The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2006 income by $5.3 million before tax, or $3.4 million after tax. In May 2006, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 43.3 million shares of common stock. We received proceeds of approximately $575.0 million from the transaction.
In November 2006, Tailwind Holdings issued $130.0 million of senior, secured notes in a private placement. Interest on the notes is variable based upon a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin. None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Tailwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123(R)), SFAS 123(R) focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee service in exchange for share-based payments. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Share-Based Payment.
Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158), SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income. Also, under SFAS 158, defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations are to be measured as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end. The adoption of SFAS 158, which resulted in an $84.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity, had no effect on our results of operations.

2005 Significant Transactions and Events
California Settlement Agreement and Amendment of the Multistate Market Conduct Examination Settlement Agreements
In the third quarter of 2005, certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries entered into a settlement agreement with the California DOI, concluding a market conduct examination and investigation of the subsidiaries' disability claims handling practices. The California DOI had chosen not to join the 2004 multistate settlement agreements. As part of the settlement with the California DOI, we paid a civil penalty of $8.0 million and agreed to change certain practices and policy provisions related to our California business. The settlement also incorporates claims handling practices previously covered by the multistate settlement agreements and includes certain additional claim handling changes.
Based on the settlement agreement and related matters, in the third quarter of 2005 we recorded a charge of $75.0 million before tax, or $51.6 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $14.3 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the reassessment process; $37.3 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $15.4 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $8.0 million civil penalty. The charge decreased before-tax operating results for the Unum US segment group income protection line of business and supplemental and voluntary lines of business $37.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment $34.3 million.
Income Tax
In the third quarter of 2005, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $10.8 million related to the finalization of income tax reviews of our U.K. subsidiaries.
During the first quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service completed its examination of tax years 1999 through 2001 and issued its revenue agent's report (RAR) in April 2005. Income tax liabilities of approximately $32.0 million that related primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of 2005, all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense.
Disposition
During the third quarter of 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Unum Limited, completed the sale of its Netherlands branch. The gain on the sale was approximately $5.7 million before tax and $4.0 million after tax.
Financing
During 2005, we repaid $227.0 million of maturing debt. In November 2005, we completed a long-term debt offering, issuing $400.0 million of 6.85% senior notes due November 15, 2015.
 
Closed Block Reinsurance Recapture
During the third quarter of 2005, we recaptured a closed block of individual income protection business originally ceded to Centre Life Reinsurance Ltd. in 1996. The recaptured business included approximately $1.6 billion in invested assets and $185.0 million of annual premium. The effective date of the recapture was August 8, 2005. The underlying operating results of the reinsurance contract, prior to recapture, were reflected in other income. The recapture therefore did not have a material impact on operating income for our Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment.
2004 Significant Transactions and Events
Settlement of Multistate Market Conduct Examination
During 2004, certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination led by Maine, Massachusetts, and Tennessee relating to our disability claims handling practices. A total of 48 states and the District of Columbia are parties to the settlement agreements. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor, which had been conducting an inquiry relating to certain ERISA plans, is a party to the settlement agreements, and the NYAG, which had engaged in its own investigation of our claims handling practices, notified us that it was in support of the settlement and was, therefore, closing its investigation on this issue. The examination report did not make any findings of violations of law or market conduct regulations. However, the examination report did identify areas of concern. These became the focus of specific changes and enhancements to our disability claims handling operations which are designed to assure each claim decision is made in a consistently high quality manner.
The primary components of the settlement agreements include enhancements to our claims handling procedures; a reassessment process for claimants of certain previously denied or closed claims who elect to participate; additional corporate and board governance to support the oversight of the reassessment process and general claims handling practices; and payment of a fine in the amount of $15.0 million that was allocated among the states and jurisdictions that joined the agreements and a potential fine of $145.0 million in the future if certain standards are not met in examinations at the end of approximately two years.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a charge of $127.0 million before tax, or $87.8 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $27.5 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the two-year reassessment process; $44.0 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $40.5 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $15.0 million fine. The charge decreased before-tax operating results for the Unum US segment group income protection and individual income protection  recently issued lines of business $116.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and the Individual Income Protection  Closed Block segment $8.6 million.
Disposition
During the second quarter of 2004, we closed the sale of our Canadian operations. Financial results for the Canadian branch are reported as discontinued operations. The loss recognized during 2004 was $60.8 million after tax.
 
Restructuring of Individual Income Protection  Closed Block Business
In the first quarter of 2004, we restructured our individual income protection  closed block business and entered into reinsurance agreements which effectively provide approximately 60 percent reinsurance coverage for our overall consolidated risk above a specified retention limit. We have not yet reached the retention limit and do not currently anticipate that once reached, our losses would exceed the maximum risk limit for the reinsurer and revert back to us. The reinsurance recoverable for this contract, as reported in our consolidated balance sheets, was approximately $615.0 million at June 30, 2007.
In conjunction with the restructuring of the individual income protection  closed block business, effective January 1, 2004, we modified our reporting segments to include a separate segment for this business. The reporting, monitoring, and management of the closed block of individual income protection business as a discrete segment is consistent with our financial restructuring and separation of this business from the lines of business which actively market new products. In the past, this business had been reported in combination with the individual income protection  recently issued line of business. Prior to 2004, detailed separate financial metrics and models were unavailable to appropriately manage this block of business separately from the recently issued individual income protection block of business.
The separation of the closed block business into a separate reporting segment required us to perform, separately for the individual income protection  closed block business and individual income protection  recently issued business, impairment testing for goodwill and loss recognition testing for the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired. As required under GAAP, prior to the change in reporting segments, these tests were performed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. The testing indicated impairment of the individual income protection  closed block deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, and goodwill balances of $282.2 million, $367.1 million, and $207.1 million, respectively. These impairment charges, $856.4 million before tax and $629.1 million after tax, were recorded in the first quarter of 2004.
Also as part of the restructuring, we analyzed our reserve assumptions related to our individual income protection  closed block reserves as a stand-alone segment. Previously these reserves were analyzed for the individual income protection line of business on a combined basis. Included in the analysis was a review of morbidity assumptions, primarily claim resolution rates, and claim reserve discount rate assumptions. Based upon this analysis, we lowered the claim reserve discount rate to reflect the segmentation of the investment portfolio between the individual income protection  recently issued business and the individual income protection  closed block business, the duration of the assets and the related policy liabilities. Based on this analysis, in the first quarter of 2004 we increased our individual income protection  closed block claim reserves by $110.6 million before tax, or $71.9 million after tax, to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations.
