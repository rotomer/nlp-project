SECTION 1. The number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors in the manner prescribed in the Certificate of Incorporation. Except as provided in Section 3 of this Article, the directors to be elected at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders at which a quorum is present shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at such Annual Meeting of Stockholders, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, and each director so elected shall hold office until the third Annual Meeting following such election and until his successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation, retirement or removal. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director. Votes "against' will count as a vote cast with respect to that director, but "abstentions" will not count as a vote cast with respect to that director. If a director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. If the director who tenders his or her resignation is a member of the Governance Committee, that director will not participate in the Committee's recommendation to the Board. The Board will act on the Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision. No person elected or re-elected a director shall, after such person's seventieth birthday, serve as a director of the Corporation beyond the date of the Corporation's annual meeting immediately following such birthday; provided, that notwithstanding having reached his or her seventieth birthday, any director serving as a Chair or Co-Chair of the Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors may serve until the annual meeting following his or her resignation or removal as Chair or Co-Chair.

SECTION 3. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Upon receipt by the Corporation or its transfer agent of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of uncertificated shares, the Corporation shall cancel such uncertificated shares, issue or cause to be issued to the person entitled thereto new equivalent uncertificated shares (or, if requested by the appropriate person, a new certificate to the person entitled thereto), and record the transfer upon its books.

SECTION 1. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify each person who is or was, or is threatened to be made, a party to or witness in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than one by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or of Union Mutual Life Insurance Company, a Maine mutual insurance company (the "Mutual Company"), or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or the Mutual Company as a director, officer, employee or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, and amounts paid in settlement, incurred by him in connection with defending, investigating, preparing to defend, or being or preparing to be a witness in, such action, suit, proceeding or claim, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.
Indemnification in Actions, Suits, or Proceedings Other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation.
 
SECTION Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify each person who is or was, or is threatened to be made, a party to or witness in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or claim by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or of the Mutual Company or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or the Mutual Company as a director, officer, employee or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses), and, if and to the extent permitted by applicable law, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement, incurred by him in connection with defending, investigating, preparing to defend, or being or preparing to be a witness in, such action, suit, proceeding or claim, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any such claim or any issue or matter in any such action, suit or proceeding as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless (and only to the extent that) the Court of Chancery or the court in which such claim, action, suit or proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses and amounts which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
2. Indemnification in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation.
provided, however,
SECTION 3. (a) Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the person seeking indemnification is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination (and determinations under Sections 5 and 6 of this Article VIII) shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit, proceeding or claim with respect to which indemnification is sought ("disinterested directors"), or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, in a written opinion of independent legal counsel chosen by the Board of Directors, or (iii) by the stockholders; that if a Change in Control (as defined in this Section 3) has occurred and the person seeking indemnification so requests, such determination (and determination under Sections 5 and 6 of this Article VIII) shall be made in a written opinion rendered by independent legal counsel chosen by the person seeking indemnification and not reasonably objected to by the Board of Directors (whose fees and expenses shall be paid by the Corporation). To the extent, however, that a director, officer, employee or trustee or former director, officer, employee or trustee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, proceeding or claim described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification.
2
provided, however,
(b) For purposes of the proviso to the second sentence of Section 3(a), "independent legal counsel" shall mean legal counsel other than an attorney, or a firm having associated with it an attorney, who has been retained by or who has performed services for the Corporation, the Mutual Company or the person seeking indemnification within the previous three years.
(c) A "Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the Corporation of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 5(f) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Act, whether or not the Corporation is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, without limitation, such a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding securities without the prior approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such acquisition, or (ii) the Corporation is a party to a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other reorganization, or proxy contest, as a consequence of which members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the Board of Directors thereafter, or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of
 
Directors (including for this purpose any new director whose election or nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors.
SECTION 4. (a) For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if such person relied on the records or books of account of the Corporation, the Mutual Company or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation, the Mutual Company or another enterprise, or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation, the Mutual Company or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation, the Mutual Company or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4(a) shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or the Mutual Company as a director, officer, employee or trustee.
Good Faith Defined, Etc.
(b) The termination of any action, suit, proceeding or claim by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that he had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
(c) References in this Article VIII to "penalties" include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; references in this Article VIII to "serving at the request of the Corporation or the Mutual Company" include any service as a director, officer or employee or former director, officer or employee of the Corporation or the Mutual Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such person with respect to an employee benefit plan or its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the participants or beneficiaries of such an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.
(d) The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
SECTION 5. . Except as otherwise provided in the proviso to Section 2 of this Article VIII:
Right to Indemnification Upon Application; Procedure Upon Application; Etc
(a) Any indemnification under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII shall be made no later than 45 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the director, officer, employee or trustee or former director, officer, employee or trustee unless a determination is made within said 45-day period in accordance with Section 3 of this Article VIII that such person has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII.
(b) The right to indemnification under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII or advances under Section 6 of this Article VIII shall be enforceable by the director, officer, employee or trustee or former director, officer, employee or trustee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Following a Change in Control, the burden of proving that indemnification is not appropriate shall be on the Corporation. Neither the absence of any prior determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances, nor a prior determination that indemnification is not proper in the circumstances, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the director, officer, employee or trustee or former director, officer, employee or trustee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by the director, officer, employee or trustee or former director, officer, employee or trustee in
 
connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action (or in any action or claim brought by him to recover under any insurance policy or policies referred to in Section 9 of this Article VIII) shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
(c) If any person is entitled under any provision of this Article VIII to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement incurred by him, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify such person for the portion of such expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts to which he is entitled.
SECTION 6. Expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by a director, officer, employee or trustee or a former director, officer, employee or trustee in defending, investigating, preparing to defend, or being or preparing to be a witness in, a threatened or pending action, suit, proceeding or claim against him, whether civil or criminal, may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, proceeding or claim upon receipt by the Corporation of a written request therefor and a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or trustee or former director, officer, employee or trustee to repay such amounts if it shall be determined in accordance with Section 3 of this Article VIII that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation; that if he seeks to enforce his rights in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 5(b) of this Article VIII, said undertaking to repay shall not be applicable or enforceable unless and until there is a final court determination that he is not entitled to indemnification as to which all rights of approval have been exhausted or have expired.
Expenses Payable in Advance.
provided, however,
SECTION 7. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VIII, no person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII or to advances under Section 6 of this Article VIII with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or claim brought or made by him against the Corporation or the Mutual Company, other than an action, suit, proceeding or claim seeking, or defending such person's right to, indemnification and/or expense advances pursuant to this Article VIII or otherwise.
Certain Persons Not Entitled to Indemnification.
SECTION 8. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the person seeking indemnification or expense advances may be entitled under any agreement, contract, or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7 of this Article VIII, but notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VIII, it is the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of and expense advances to the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law, and, accordingly, in the event of any change in law, by legislation or otherwise, permitting greater indemnification of and/or expense advances to any such person, the provisions of this Article VIII shall be construed so as to require such greater indemnification and/or expense advances. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section I or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or otherwise. The provisions of this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
Non-Exclusivity and Survival of Indemnification.
SECTION 9.The Corporation may purchase and maintain at its expense insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or the Mutual Company or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or the Mutual Company as a director, officer, employee or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability or expense asserted against or incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him against such liability or expense under the provisions of this Article VIII or the provisions of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Company shall not be obligated under this Article VIII to make any payment in connection with any claim made against
Insurance.
 
any person if and to the extent that such person has actually received payment therefor under any insurance policy or policies.
SECTION 10.This Article VIII shall be binding upon and enforceable against any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation. For purposes of this Article VIII, but subject to the provisions of any agreement relating to any merger or consolidation of the kind referred to in clause (i) below or of any agreement relating to the acquisition of any corporation of the kind referred to in clause (ii) below, references to "the Corporation" shall include (i) any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger with the Corporation which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees, so that any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the Corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued; and (ii) any corporation of which at least a majority of the voting power (as represented by its outstanding stock having voting power generally in the election of directors) is owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation.
Successors; Meaning of "Corporation".
SECTION 11. The provisions of this Article VIII shall be severable in the event that any provision hereof (including any provision within a single section, subsection, clause, paragraph or sentence) is held invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any such holding, the remaining provisions of this Article VIII shall continue in effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
