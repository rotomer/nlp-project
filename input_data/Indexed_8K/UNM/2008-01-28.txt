$0.5 million after-tax loss in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding these losses, net realized after-tax investment gains were $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.

While the uncertain economic environment remains a challenge, we believe that we are very well positioned for this environment and to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead."
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
In the following discussions of the Company's operating segment results, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains and losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
Unum US Segment
Unum US reported operating income of $166.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to operating income of $135.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The improvement in operating income was primarily due to favorable risk trends in the fourth quarter of 2007 which resulted in lower benefit ratios in the three primary business lines. This positive performance offset higher operating expense ratios in the segment which resulted from higher advertising and branding expenses, incentive accruals, and product and service development costs. Premium income declined 4.1 percent to $1,248.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, from $1,302.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Within Unum US, the group disability line of business (formerly referred to as group income protection) reported operating income of $41.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to operating income of $35.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 91.5 percent, compared to 94.0 percent in the

fourth quarter of 2006. Improvements in the benefit ratio continue to track improvements in the claims management process as well as stable claim incidence trends in both the group long-term and short-term disability lines of business relative to the fourth quarter of 2006. Premium income in group disability declined 5.8 percent to $588.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $625.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decline remains attributable to the Company's disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of fully insured group disability products in the core market segment (employers with less than 2,000 lives) increased 20.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $69.2 million, compared to $57.3 million in the year ago quarter. Sales of fully insured group disability products in the large case market (employers with 2,000 lives or greater) declined by 52.7 percent to $30.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $65.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 as the Company continues to shift its mix of business. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 85.1 percent for full year 2007 compared to 87.8 percent in 2006. Case persistency for this line was 88.4 percent for full year 2007, compared to 87.4 percent in 2006. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 74.0 percent for full year 2007, compared to 85.6 percent in 2006. Case persistency for the line was 87.4 percent for full year 2007, compared to 86.2 percent in 2006.
The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 29.8 percent increase in operating income to $60.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $46.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The improvement in operating income primarily reflects improved risk results. Premium income for this line of business

declined 12.2 percent to $306.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $348.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Results reflect the Company's ongoing disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of group life products in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to $61.3 million, compared to $55.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, with an increase of 19.6 percent in core market sales and an increase of 0.4 percent in large case sales. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 78.8 percent for full year 2007, compared to 81.2 percent in 2006. Case persistency for full year 2007 was 87.7 percent, compared to 86.9 percent in 2006.
The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 19.6 percent increase in operating income to $65.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $54.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily reflecting improved claims experience. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 7.6 percent to $353.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $328.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 14.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line (formerly referred to as individual income protection  recently issued) declined 5.5 percent, and long-term care sales increased 5.8 percent compared with the year ago quarter.
Unum UK Segment
Unum UK reported operating income of $85.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a 3.9 percent increase, compared to $81.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The benefit ratio for the segment was 60.8

percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to 60.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. Favorable currency exchange rates continued to benefit reported results for the segment. In local currency, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2007 declined 2.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006.

Colonial reported a 16.4 percent increase in operating income to $58.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Results in the fourth quarter of 2007 were driven by continued favorable claims experience across all major product lines which offset higher expenses related to Colonial's brand development and product promotion initiatives. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 48.0 percent, compared to 52.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. Premium income for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 6.8 percent to $232.0 million, compared to $217.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales increased 12.1 percent to $114.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $101.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.

OTHER INFORMATION
Share Repurchase Program
On October 31, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $700 million of the Company's common stock, which it intended to initiate upon completion of its debt reduction program. Based on the Company's strong capital position at year end 2007 and its substantial progress in completing the debt reduction program, the Company intends to proceed with this program as soon as possible, despite the uncertain economic environment. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on various factors such as the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price.
Shares Outstanding
The Company's average number of shares (000s) outstanding, assuming dilution, was 360,707.6 for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to 345,527.8 for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Book Value
Book value per common share as of December 31, 2007 was $22.28, compared to $22.53 at December 31, 2006. Excluding the net unrealized gain on

securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at December 31, 2007 was $20.79, compared to $20.40 at December 31, 2006.
Claim Reassessment Update
The Company has completed the claim reassessment process, as required by the regulatory settlement agreements. Since September 30, 2007, the final 256 claims were reviewed with an overturn rate of 66 percent. The final examination under the multistate regulatory settlement agreement is anticipated to be completed by mid-year 2008. Supplemental disclosure on the claim reassessment results for the fourth quarter of 2007 is available in the "Investor Information" section of the Company's website.
OUTLOOK
The Company is reaffirming its previously stated guidance for full year 2008 and anticipates operating earnings for the year of between $2.35 and $2.40 per diluted common share. Incorporated in the Company's estimates is continued improvement in the benefit ratio for the Unum US group disability line to within a range of 88 percent to 89 percent by late 2008 to early 2009.
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, and excluding certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains

and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business. The exclusion of certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation also enhances the understanding and comparability of the Company's performance and the underlying fundamentals in its operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

The decrease in the Unum US segment and Individual Disability - Closed Block segment IBNR from December 31, 2006 is due to the release of reserves to cover costs for the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements and the California settlement agreement and related matters and a slight decline in insured lives in the group disability, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business. Offsetting the release for Unum US group disability is the second quarter of 2007 claim reassessment revision to increase reserves $76.5 million.
The increase in Unum US Policy and Claim Reserves Incurred from December 31, 2006 is due to growth in the disabled life reserves in the Unum US group disability line of business and growth in the active life reserves for the Unum US long-term care and individual disability - recently issued lines of business.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: Statutory results for our domestic insurers are reported in conformity with statutory accounting principles as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and adopted by the applicable state laws. For UnumProvident International Ltd., results are reported in conformity with accounting principles as prescribed by applicable Bermuda laws. Unum Group implemented a new reserve valuation system for its individual disability reserves during 2007, effective January 1, 2007. The new system establishes active life and claim reserves and incurred but not reported (IBNR) and in course of settlement (ICOS) claim liabilities using revised assumptions based on current experience, minimum reserving requirements, and specified valuation methodologies. The change in the active life and claim reserves was reported as a change in valuation basis and was recorded directly to statutory surplus rather than as a part of the reserve change recognized in the summary of operations. The change in the IBNR and ICOS claim liabilities was recognized as a reserve change in the summary of operations. The implementation increased the 2007 net gain from operations after tax and net income $114.9 million in the third quarter and $79.6 million in the fourth quarter, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Company's performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Company's underlying business. We also believe that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Company's performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim. The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.
The revised second quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately 99 percent of the potential inventory of claim reassessment information forms returned to us, with our claim reassessment on approximately 88 percent of the forms completed at that time. At the time of our second quarter of 2007 revision, we had not yet finalized our claim reassessment on the remaining forms but had performed a financial review and included that information in our analysis of emerging experience. Additional information regarding the second quarter revision to our estimate is as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX). Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations. The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%. We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired. The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax. In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock. We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015. The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and retired $17.5 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes scheduled to mature in 2028. Pursuant to a cash tender offer, we tendered $23.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038; $99.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.625% notes due 2011; $210.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.375% notes due 2032; and $66.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% notes due 2028. We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature in 2032. The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
 
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings, LLC issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement. Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin. None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings, LLC is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
During 2007, we made principal payments of $17.5 million on our senior secured notes due 2036 which were issued by Tailwind Holdings, LLC.
Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Statement of Position 05-1 (SOP 05-1), . SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97, . The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of SOP 05-1 decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.
Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), . FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 increased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $22.7 million.

2006 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for the claim reassessment process. Our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of 2006, when actual results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the reassessment process. We concluded that a change in our initial assumptions, primarily related to the number of claimants for whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments, was warranted. We based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time, which was the actual cost related to approximately 20 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed. The characteristics, profile, and cost of those initial 20 percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in 2004 and 2005. Based on our analysis, in the first quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $86.0 million before tax, or $55.9 million after tax, to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment. The first quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $72.8 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $13.2 million.
 
In the third quarter of 2006 we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process $325.4 million before tax and $211.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim. The revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately 55 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed. The third quarter charge was comprised of $310.4 million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and $15.0 million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the additional time then estimated to complete the process. Our best estimate of $310.4 million for the reopened claims assumed that the nature and characteristics of the approximately 45 percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the average profile of the 55 percent already reviewed at that time. The third quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $291.4 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.0 million.
Broker Compensation Settlement
In June 2004, we received a subpoena from the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) requesting documents and information relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers or intermediaries and our subsidiaries. In November 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with the NYAG in the form of an assurance of discontinuance that provided for a national restitution fund of $15.5 million, a fine of $1.9 million, and certain other expenses approximating $1.1 million.
Income Tax
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded income of $2.6 million before tax and approximately $3.9 million after tax attributable to the receipt of interest and tax refunds on prior year tax items in excess of what was previously provided. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $91.9 million as the result of the reversal of tax liabilities related primarily to group relief benefits recognized from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in which our businesses operate.
Financing
In the second quarter of 2006, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we purchased $50.0 million of our outstanding 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.625% notes due 2011. The cost of the cash tender offer decreased second quarter 2006 income by $17.8 million before tax, or $11.6 million after tax. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we purchased $32.0 million of our outstanding 6.850% notes due 2015 on the open market. The cost of the debt purchase decreased fourth quarter 2006 income by $2.7 million before tax, or $1.9 million after tax.
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the units issued in May 2003 occurred in February 2006, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $575.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2008 to 5.997%. We purchased $400.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired. The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2006 income by $5.3 million before tax, or $3.4 million after tax. In
 
May 2006, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 43.3 million shares of common stock. We received proceeds of approximately $575.0 million from the transaction.
In November 2006, Tailwind Holdings, LLC issued $130.0 million of senior, secured notes in a private placement. Interest on the notes is variable based upon LIBOR plus a margin. None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Tailwind Holdings, LLC is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123(R)), SFAS 123(R) focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee service in exchange for share-based payments. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Share-Based Payment.
Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158), . SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income. Also, under SFAS 158, defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations are to be measured as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end. The adoption of SFAS 158, which resulted in an $84.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity, had no effect on our results of operations.

2005 Significant Transactions and Events
California Settlement Agreement and Amendment of the Multistate Market Conduct Examination Settlement Agreements
In the third quarter of 2005, certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries entered into a settlement agreement with the California Department of Insurance (DOI), in connection with a market conduct examination and investigation of the subsidiaries' disability claims handling practices. The California DOI had chosen not to join the 2004 multistate settlement agreements our insurance subsidiaries entered into with state insurance regulators of 48 states upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination that became effective on December 21, 2004. As part of the settlement with the California DOI, we paid a civil penalty of $8.0 million and agreed to change certain practices and policy provisions related to our California business. The settlement also incorporated claims handling practices previously covered by the multistate settlement agreements and included certain additional claim handling changes.
Based on the settlement agreement and related matters, in the third quarter of 2005 we recorded a charge of $75.0 million before tax, or $51.6 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $14.3 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the reassessment process; $37.3 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $15.4 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are
 
anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $8.0 million civil penalty. The charge decreased before-tax operating results for the Unum US segment group disability line of business and supplemental and voluntary lines of business $37.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and the Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.3 million.
Income Tax
In the third quarter of 2005, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $10.8 million related to the finalization of income tax reviews of our U.K. subsidiaries.
In April 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of tax years 1999 through 2001 and issued its revenue agent's report (RAR). Income tax liabilities of approximately $32.0 million that related primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of 2005, all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense.
Disposition
During the third quarter of 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Unum Limited, completed the sale of its Netherlands branch. The gain on the sale was approximately $5.7 million before tax and $4.0 million after tax.
Financing
During 2005, we repaid $227.0 million of maturing debt. In November 2005, we completed a long-term debt offering, issuing $400.0 million of 6.85% senior notes due 2015.
Closed Block Reinsurance Recapture
During the third quarter of 2005, we recaptured a closed block of individual disability business. The recaptured business included approximately $1.6 billion in invested assets and $185.0 million of annual premium. The effective date of the recapture was August 8, 2005. The underlying operating results of the reinsurance contract, prior to recapture, were reflected in other income. The recapture therefore did not have a material impact on operating income for our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment.
