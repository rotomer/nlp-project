Unum Group Reports Second Quarter 2008 Results
Strong Operating Performance
Investment Portfolio Quality Remains Sound
2008 Guidance Revised Upward
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today announced its results for the second quarter of 2008. The Company reported net income of $240.3 million ($0.69 per diluted common share), compared to net income of $153.5 million ($0.43 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2007.
Included in the results for the second quarter of 2008 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $17.1 million ($0.04 per diluted common share) which include an after-tax gain of $0.9 million related to net sales and write-downs of assets and an after-tax gain of $16.2 million resulting from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with certain modified coinsurance arrangements. This compares to net realized after-tax investment gains of $6.5 million ($0.02 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2007. Included in the prior year second quarter results is a net increase in the provision for the cost related to the claim reassessment process of $53.0 million before tax, or $34.5 million after tax ($0.10 per diluted common share).
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $223.2 million ($0.65 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $181.5 million ($0.51 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2007.
I am very pleased with our results in the second quarter and first half of the year, especially the steady, consistent performance we have seen throughout the Company, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. On an operating level, all of our businesses continued to perform well, and we maintained our strong investment performance and financial flexibility despite the continued challenging financial markets.
Looking ahead, while we expect these challenging times to continue, we believe there are opportunities to profitably grow our business while maintaining the risk management principles that have contributed to our past success.
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses. Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
Unum US Segment
Unum US reported operating income of $176.2 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to operating income of $92.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. Included in the results of the second quarter of 2007 is a net reduction to operating income of $66.2 million resulting from an expense of $76.5 million related to the Companys revised estimates of the benefit costs for the claim reassessment process and a $10.3 million release from the operating expense reserve related to the same.

Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $45.7 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to an operating loss of $15.4 million in the second quarter of 2007. Included in the results of the second quarter of 2007 are the revised cost estimates for the reassessment process described above, which resulted in a reduction to operating income of $66.2 million. Excluding these items, operating income for this line of business was $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2007. The decline in operating income relative to the year ago quarter is primarily due to lower net investment income from bond calls and other miscellaneous net investment income and higher expenses, which offset a decline in the benefit ratio. The benefit ratio for the second quarter of 2008 was 90.5 percent. Excluding the reassessment reserve revision, the benefit ratio for the second quarter of 2007 was 92.7 percent. The improvement in the benefit ratio was driven by underlying improvements in the claims management process and favorable claims experience in both the group long-term and short-term disability lines of business. Premium income in group disability declined 5.9 percent to $573.6 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $609.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. The decline remains primarily attributable to the Companys disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the second quarter of 2008 declined by 14.3 percent to $45.4 million, compared to $53.0 million in the second quarter of 2007. Sales in the Companys core market (under 2000 lives) increased by 5.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008 to $27.8 million from $26.4 million in the second quarter of 2007. Sales in the large case market (over 2000 lives) declined by 33.8 percent to $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products increased by 1.2 percent to $16.4 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 88.3 percent for the first six months of 2008, compared to 83.9 percent in the first six months of 2007. Case persistency for this line was 88.6 percent for the first six months of 2008, compared to 87.7 percent in the comparable year ago period. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 83.6 percent for the first six months of 2008, compared to 74.9 percent for the comparable period in 2007. Case persistency for the line was 87.4 percent for the first six months of 2008, compared to 86.6 percent in the first six months of 2007.
The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 5.4 percent increase in operating income to $54.3 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $51.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, reflecting relatively stable incidence and a lower average claim size. Premium income for this line of business declined 2.8 percent to $300.6 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $309.2 million in the second quarter of 2007, reflecting the Companys ongoing disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of group life products increased by 9.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008 to $38.6 million; in the second quarter of 2007 sales were $35.3 million. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 84.8 percent in the first six months of 2008, compared to 78.3 percent for the comparable period in 2007. Case persistency for the first six months of 2008 was 88.2 percent and was 86.5 percent for the comparable period in 2007.
The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 35.6 percent increase in operating income to $76.2 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $56.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. The improvement in operating income was driven by strong results in all three business lines; individual disability  recently issued, long-term care and voluntary benefits. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 7.3 percent to $372.7 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $347.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. Sales in the voluntary benefits line of business declined 3.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line declined 11.7 percent, and long-term care sales increased 7.4 percent compared with the year ago quarter.
Unum UK Segment
Unum UK reported operating income of $96.0 million in the second quarter of 2008, a 23.6 percent increase, compared to $77.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. Operating income benefited from a decline in the benefit ratio to 58.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008 compared to 62.2 percent in the second quarter of 2007. The decline primarily resulted from favorable claims incidence in the group life line of business and strong recovery results for group disability. Currency exchange rates were slightly lower for the second quarter of 2008 than in the comparable period a year ago. In local currency, operating income for the second quarter of 2008 increased 24.6 percent from the second quarter of 2007.

Sales increased 11.2 percent to $30.9 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $27.8 million in the second quarter of 2007. In local currency, sales for the second quarter of 2008 increased 12.1 percent compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Colonial Life Segment
Colonial Life reported a 5.1 percent increase in operating income to $68.2 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $64.9 million in the second quarter of 2007. Results in the second quarter of 2008 were driven by continued positive claims experience in the accident, sickness, and disability line of business. The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2008 was 46.9 percent, compared to 47.2 percent for the same period in 2007. Premium income for the second quarter of 2008 increased 7.9 percent to $242.6 million, compared to $224.8 million in the second quarter of 2007.

OTHER INFORMATION
Share Repurchase Program
During 2007, the Companys board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700 million of the Companys common stock. The Company exercised a portion of the authorization with the completion of a $350 million accelerated share repurchase which commenced in January 2008 and settled in May 2008. Based on the Companys strong capital position and its performance through the first half of 2008, the Company intends to enter into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement for the balance of the current authorization as soon as possible.
Shares Outstanding
The Companys average number of shares (000s) outstanding, assuming dilution, was 346,035.4 for the second quarter of 2008, compared to 354,837.4 for the second quarter of 2007.
Book Value
Book value per common share as of June 30, 2008 was $22.19, compared to $20.43 at June 30, 2007. Excluding the net unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at June 30, 2008 was $21.77, compared to $19.84 at June 30, 2007.
OUTLOOK
The Company is increasing its previously stated guidance for operating earnings of $2.37 to $2.42 for full year 2008 and currently anticipates operating earnings for the year to be between $2.46 and $2.51 per diluted common share. Incorporated in the Companys estimates is continued improvement in the benefit ratio for the Unum US group disability line to within a range of 88 percent to 89 percent by late 2008 to early 2009.
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, and excluding certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business. The exclusion of certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation also enhances the understanding and comparability of the Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in its operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We also believe that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  During January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  A 30 percent partial acceleration of the agreement, 4.2 million shares, occurred on March 26, 2008 and settled on March 28, 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 0.5 million additional shares of our common stock.  The remaining 9.8 million shares settled on May 29, 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 0.9 million additional shares.  In total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreement.
Financing
During the second quarter of 2008, we retired the remaining $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes.  The notes, issued in May 2003 as a component of our adjustable conversion-rate equity units, represent the outstanding remarketed portion of the original issuance of $575.0 million.  We previously repurchased and retired $400.0 million of the original issuance at the time of the closing of the remarketing of the units in February 2006.
During the first six months of 2008, we made principal payments of $25.4 million and $5.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC and Tailwind Holdings, LLC respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.

2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX).  Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations.  The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%.  We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax.  In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and retired $17.5 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes scheduled to mature in 2028.  Pursuant to a cash tender offer, we tendered $23.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038; $99.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.625% notes due 2011; $210.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.375% notes due 2032; and $66.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% notes due 2028.  We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature in 2032.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings, LLC issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings, LLC is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
During 2007, we made principal payments of $17.5 million on our senior secured notes due 2036 which were issued by Tailwind Holdings, LLC.

Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Statement of Position 05-1 (SOP 05-1), .  SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97, . The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of SOP 05-1 decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.

2006 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for the claim reassessment process.  Our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of 2006, when actual results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the reassessment process.  We concluded that a change in our initial assumptions, primarily related to the number of claimants for whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments, was warranted.  We based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time, which was the actual cost related to approximately 20 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.  The characteristics, profile, and cost of those initial 20 percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in 2004 and 2005.  Based on our analysis, in the first quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $86.0 million before tax, or $55.9 million after tax, to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment.The first quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $72.8 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $13.2 million.
  
In the third quarter of 2006 we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process $325.4 million before tax and $211.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately 55 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.  The third quarter charge was comprised of $310.4 million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and $15.0 million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the additional time then estimated to complete the process.  Our best estimate of $310.4 million for the reopened claims assumed

that the nature and characteristics of the approximately 45 percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the average profile of the 55 percent already reviewed at that time.  The third quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $291.4 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.0 million. 
Broker Compensation Settlement
In June 2004, we received a subpoena from the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) requesting documents and information relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers or intermediaries and our subsidiaries.  In November 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with the NYAG in the form of an assurance of discontinuance that provided for a national restitution fund of $15.5 million, a fine of $1.9 million, and certain other expenses approximating $1.1 million.
 
Income Tax
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded income of $2.6 million before tax and approximately $3.9 million after tax attributable to the receipt of interest and tax refunds on prior year tax items in excess of what was previously provided. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $91.9 million as the result of the reversal of tax liabilities related primarily to group relief benefits recognized from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in which our businesses operate.
Financing
In the second quarter of 2006, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we purchased $50.0 million of our outstanding 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.625% notes due 2011.  The cost of the cash tender offer decreased second quarter 2006 income by $17.8 million before tax, or $11.6 million after tax.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, we purchased $32.0 million of our outstanding 6.850% notes due 2015 on the open market.  The cost of the debt purchase decreased fourth quarter 2006 income by $2.7 million before tax, or $1.9 million after tax.
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the units issued in May 2003 occurred in February 2006, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $575.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2008 to 5.997%.  We purchased $400.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2006 income by $5.3 million before tax, or $3.4 million after tax.  In May 2006, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 43.3 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $575.0 million from the transaction.
In November 2006, Tailwind Holdings, LLC issued $130.0 million of senior, secured notes in a private placement. Interest on the notes is variable based upon LIBOR plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Tailwind Holdings, LLC is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.

Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123(R)), SFAS 123(R) focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee service in exchange for share-based payments.  The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Share-Based Payment.  
Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158), .  SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income.  Also, under SFAS 158, defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations are to be measured as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end.  The adoption of SFAS 158, which resulted in an $84.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, had no effect on our results of operations.

2005 Significant Transactions and Events
California Settlement Agreement and Amendment of the Multistate Market Conduct Examination Settlement Agreements
In the third quarter of 2005, certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries entered into a settlement agreement with the California Department of Insurance (DOI), in connection with a market conduct examination and investigation of the subsidiaries disability claims handling practices.  The California DOI had chosen not to join the 2004 multistate settlement agreements our insurance subsidiaries entered into with state insurance regulators of 48 states upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination that became effective on December 21, 2004.  As part of the settlement with the California DOI, we paid a civil penalty of $8.0 million and agreed to change certain practices and policy provisions related to our California business.  The settlement also incorporated claims handling practices previously covered by the multistate settlement agreements and included certain additional claim handling changes.
Based on the settlement agreement and related matters, in the third quarter of 2005 we recorded a charge of $75.0 million before tax, or $51.6 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $14.3 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the reassessment process; $37.3 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $15.4 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $8.0 million civil penalty.  The charge decreased before- tax operating results for the Unum US segment group disability line of business and supplemental and voluntary lines of business $37.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and the Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.3 million.
Income Tax
In the third quarter of 2005, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $10.8 million related to the finalization of income tax reviews of our U.K. subsidiaries.

16.4
In April 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of tax years 1999 through 2001 and issued its revenue agents report (RAR).  Income tax liabilities of approximately $32.0 million that related primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of 2005, all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense.
Disposition
During the third quarter of 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Unum Limited, completed the sale of its Netherlands branch.  The gain on the sale was approximately $5.7 million before tax and $4.0 million after tax.
Closed Block Reinsurance Recapture
During the third quarter of 2005, we recaptured a closed block of individual disability business.  The recaptured business included approximately $1.6 billion in invested assets and $185.0 million of annual premium.  The effective date of the recapture was August 8, 2005.  The underlying operating results of the reinsurance contract, prior to recapture, were reflected in other income.  The recapture therefore did not have a material impact on operating income for our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment.
