Furthermore, in the event that the party to whom notice is given by Mr. Watjen pursuant to Section 3(c) asserts or wishes to assert that such notice is untimely, the party making such an assertion that the notice is untimely must show that he, she or it was actually prejudiced by the late notice.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) placing the Executive on a paid leave for up to 30 days, pending the determination of whether there is a basis to terminate the Executive for Cause, shall not constitute a Good Reason event (but if the Executive is subsequently terminated for Cause, then the Executive shall repay any amounts paid by the Company to the Executive during such paid leave period); and (y) a Notice of Termination for Good Reason given by the Executive shall constitute a notice of resignation of all elected positions the Executive may hold with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (including, but not limited to, all directorships), effective as of the Date of Termination (regardless of whether the Notice of Termination expressly states that the Executive is resigning from such elected positions).

7. Certain Additional Payments by the Company
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment, benefit or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable, provided or to be provided, or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 7) (a "") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount that could be paid to the Executive such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax (the ""), then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the value of all Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. The reduction of payments hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order: (i) Section 4(a)(i)(A), (ii) Section 4(a)(i)(C), (iii) Section 4(a)(i)(B) and (iv) Section 4(a)(ii). For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Reduced Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. If the reduction of the amount payable under this Agreement would not result in a reduction of the Payments to the Reduced Amount, no amounts payable under the Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this Section 7(a). The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 7 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.

Excise Tax
Gross-Up Payment
Reduced Amount
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 7(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 7, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company prior to a Change
 
in Control and reasonably acceptable to the Executive (the "") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 7, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5) days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination; provided that the Gross-Up payment shall in all events be paid no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the Excise Tax (and any income or other related taxes or interest or penalties thereon) on a Payment are remitted to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority or, in the case of amounts relating to a claim described in Section 8(c) that does not result in the remittance of any federal, state, local and foreign income, excise, social security and other taxes, the calendar year in which the claim is finally settled or otherwise resolved. Any final determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive except in the case of manifest error. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (""), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 7(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
Accounting Firm
Underpayment
(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
 
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
(iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such payment; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
(d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount paid by the Company on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 7(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 7(c), if applicable) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after payment by the Company of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 7(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such payment shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

The Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to equitable and/or injunctive relief to prevent any breach or threatened breach of such provisions, and to specific performance of each of the terms thereof in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies that the Company may have. The Executive further agrees that he shall not, in any equity proceeding relating to the enforcement of the terms of this Section 8, raise the defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Executive violates Section 8(a) or has knowledge of the conduct that results in a violation of Section 8(b) (any such violation being a "Forfeiture Event"), then all of the Executive's outstanding equity awards shall terminate and cease to be exercisable as of that date and the Executive shall remit to the Company, in cash, an amount equal to the income recognized by the Executive on the exercise of any stock options during the 90-day period prior to such Forfeiture Event. In addition, if the Executive violates Section 8(a), then, in lieu of any other monetary damages other than the forfeiture of option gains described in the immediately preceding sentence, the Executive shall remit to the Company, in cash, the lump sum payment made to him under Section 4(a)(i) or Section 4(d) (excluding accrued Annual Base Salary earned through the Date of Termination).
(f) The terms and provisions of this Section 8 are intended to be separate and divisible provisions and if, for any reason, any one or more of them is held to be invalid or unenforceable, neither the validity nor the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall thereby be affected. The parties hereto acknowledge that the potential restrictions on the Executive's future employment imposed by this Section 8 are reasonable in both duration and geographic scope and in all other respects. If for any reason any court of competent jurisdiction shall find any provisions of this Section 8 unreasonable in duration or geographic scope or otherwise, the Executive and the Company agree that the restrictions and prohibitions contained herein shall be effective to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
(g) The parties acknowledge that this Agreement would not have been entered into and the benefits described in Sections 2 or 4 would not have been promised in the absence of the Executive's promises under this Section 8.
