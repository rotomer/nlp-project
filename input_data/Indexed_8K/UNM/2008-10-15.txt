Exhibit 99.1
Unum Group Announces Preliminary Third Quarter 2008 Results
Expects Third Quarter Operating Income of $0.62 to $0.64 Per Share
Expects 2008 Full Year Operating Income at Upper End of Previous Guidance of $2.46 to $2.51 Per Share
Has No Plans to Raise Additional Capital as Strong Capital and Liquidity Positions Continue to Provide Significant Financial Flexibility
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 15, 2008--Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today announced preliminary results for the third quarter of 2008. The Company expects net income for the third quarter of 2008 to be between $100 and $108 million ($0.30 to $0.32 per diluted common share) and after-tax operating income for the third quarter of 2008 to be between $209 and $217 million ($0.62 to $0.64 per diluted common share).
Based on preliminary estimates, the Company has provided the following comments related to its third quarter 2008 operating results.
Operating results in the quarter reflected favorable risk results, including an expected lower Unum US group disability benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2008. Net investment income results reflected lower miscellaneous net investment income in the third quarter of 2008, resulting from lower bond call activity during the quarter.
Unum US and Colonial Life segments are expected to report higher operating earnings in the third quarter of 2008 compared to results for the third quarter 2007; operating earnings for Unum UK, as reported in local currency, are expected to be marginally higher compared to the third quarter of 2007. Because of a decline in the foreign exchange rate, results reported for Unum UK in U.S. currency in the third quarter of 2008 are estimated to be lower than the third quarter of 2007 but in-line with the results of the second quarter of 2008.
Individual Disability - Closed Block segment operating earnings are expected to be lower in the third quarter 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007 primarily due to lower net investment income attributable to lower bond call activity during the quarter, which offset favorable risk results.
Thomas R. Watjen, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, Our preliminary third quarter operating results are in line with our expectations as all of our businesses continue to perform well. We have continued to benefit from our greater business diversification, financial discipline and focus on risk management throughout the Company. While our realized and unrealized investment losses are higher than in recent quarters, we remain pleased with our investment performance and feel that our portfolio is well positioned for todays volatile financial markets. Importantly too, Unums capital and liquidity positions are strong and provide us with significant financial flexibility.
Realized and Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses
Preliminary estimates for net realized after-tax investment losses for the third quarter 2008 are $109 million ($0.32 per diluted common share). Changes in the fair values of certain embedded derivatives are reported as realized investment gains and losses, as required under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36), . During the third quarter of 2008, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with modified coinsurance arrangements resulted in a realized after-tax investment loss of $44 million ($0.13 per diluted common share), which resulted primarily from a continued widening of credit spreads in the overall investment market. Excluding these losses, net realized after-tax investment losses related to sales and write-downs of assets held were $65 million ($0.19 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2008. Approximately 94 percent of the losses associated with sales and write-downs of assets were attributable to holdings in Lehman Brothers, AIG, and an equity-linked investment tied to the performance of the S&P 500.
Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposure That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments
The Companys net unrealized losses in its fixed maturity bond portfolio at September 30, 2008 are expected to be $1.73 billion, compared to $22.3 million at June 30, 2008. The Companys gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity bonds at September 30, 2008 are expected to be $2.64 billion, compared to $1.40 billion at June 30, 2008. The Company's gross unrealized gains are estimated at $910 million at September 30, 2008, compared to gross unrealized gains of $1.38 billion at June 30, 2008. The increase in gross unrealized losses in the third quarter of 2008 resulted primarily from widening credit spreads experienced during the quarter.
Capital Management
In October 2007, the Company outlined its capital management strategy and outlined specific financial targets for risk-based capital, leverage and holding company liquidity to ensure its financial flexibility. The Company estimates these measures as of September 30, 2008 will continue to outperform these targets, providing a strong level of financial flexibility, consistent with its A ratings target. The Company presently has no plans to issue additional capital.
Shares Outstanding
The Companys average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution was 337.9 million for the third quarter of 2008. The share count at the end of the third quarter of 2008 was 333.1 million. Shares outstanding for the quarter reflect the repurchase of 12.5 million shares which were repurchased as a result of a previously announced $350 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to the Company of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of its common stock, for a total repurchase of approximately 14.5 million shares. The Company has no further open authorizations for share repurchase and has fully exercised the $700 million authorization established in 2007. The Company expects to discuss its capital management plans for 2009 at its investor presentation scheduled for November 11, 2008.
Book Value
As of September 30, 2008 preliminary stockholders equity per common share, excluding net unrealized losses on securities and net gains on cash flow hedges, is expected to be between $21.43 and $21.46 per common share. Preliminary stockholders equity (book value) is expected to be between $20.19 and $20.22 per common share.
OUTLOOK
Given the preliminary estimates for the third quarter of 2008, the Company is maintaining its previously stated guidance for full-year 2008 operating earnings per share of $2.46 to $2.51 per diluted common share, but now expects to report full year results at the upper end of the range. The Company will provide greater detail on its third quarter results in its third quarter 2008 earnings statement scheduled for release on October 30, 2008 at approximately 4:00 p.m. (EST) and on its earnings call scheduled for 9:00 a.m. (EST) on October 31, 2008. The preliminary financial results being reported in this release, while believed to be reasonable estimates, are subject to being revised in the Companys Form 10-Q, anticipated to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 31, 2008.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure.
