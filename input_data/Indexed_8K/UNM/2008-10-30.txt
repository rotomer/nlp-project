Exhibit 99.1
Unum Group Reports Third Quarter 2008 Results
Continued Strong Performance across All Core Segments
Strong Capital Position Maintained
Group Disability Benefit Ratio Continues to Trend Downward
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 30, 2008--Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today announced its results for the third quarter of 2008. The Company reported net income of $108.0 million ($0.32 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2008, compared to a net income of $187.0 million ($0.52 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2007.
Included in the results for the third quarter of 2008 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $108.9 million ($0.32 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after-tax investment losses of $30.0 million ($0.08 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2007. Net realized investment losses for the third quarter of 2008 include after-tax losses of $44.1 million ($0.13 per diluted common share) related to changes in the fair values of the embedded derivatives in certain modified coinsurance contracts. Changes in the fair values of certain embedded derivatives are reported as realized investment gains and losses, as required under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Implementation Issue B36 (DIG Issue B36), . The DIG Issue B36 loss reported for the third quarter of 2008 resulted primarily from a continued widening of credit spreads in the overall investment market. Excluding these losses, net realized after-tax investment losses related to sales and write-downs of assets were $64.8 million ($0.19 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2008. As stated in the Companys preliminary earnings announcement, approximately 94 percent of the losses associated with sales and write-downs of assets were attributable to holdings in Lehman Brothers, AIG, and an equity-linked investment tied to the performance of the S&P 500.
Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposure That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments
Adjusting for the items discussed above, income on an after-tax basis was $216.9 million ($0.64 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $217.0 million ($0.60 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2007.
I am pleased with our operating results and the quality of our balance sheet in what is obviously a very uncertain economic and financial market environment, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. We are benefiting from the more disciplined strategy we have pursued over the past few years, a strategy that our people have executed extremely well. While the environment poses some unusual challenges, our more diversified business mix and the strength of our investment portfolio and capital position should continue to serve us well.
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses. Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
Unum US Segment
Unum US reported operating income of $175.9 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to operating income of $164.3 million in the third quarter of 2007. Premium income declined 1.3 percent to $1,239.1 million in the third quarter of 2008, from $1,255.3 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Within Unum US, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $53.5 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to operating income of $50.4 million in the third quarter of 2007. The benefit ratio for this line in the third quarter of 2008 was 89.3 percent, compared to 92.1 percent in the third quarter of 2007. Improvement in the ratio resulted from a higher rate of claim recoveries in group long-term disability and lower paid claims in group short-term disability. Underlying the favorable risk trends, improvements in the claims management process, implemented in prior periods, have continued to enhance efficiency in benefit center performance, contributing to benefit ratio results. Premium income for the group disability line declined 5.2 percent to $562.4 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $593.3 million in the third quarter of 2007. The decline continues to be attributable to the Companys disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products increased by 31.4 percent to $31.4 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $23.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products increased by 25.9 percent to $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $8.5 million in the third quarter of 2007. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 87.9 percent through the third quarter of 2008, compared to 84.9 percent in the first nine months of 2007. Case persistency for this line was 89.3 percent for the first nine months of 2008, compared to 88.1 percent for the comparable year ago period. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 82.1 percent for the first nine months of 2008, compared to 75.5 percent for the comparable period in 2007. Case persistency for the line was 88.1 percent for the first nine months of 2008, compared to 87.1 percent in the first nine months of 2007.
The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 9.4 percent decrease in operating income to $50.9 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $56.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. Premium income for this line of business declined 3.0 percent to $300.3 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $309.6 million in the third quarter of 2007, continuing to reflect the Companys ongoing disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection. Sales of group life products in the third quarter of 2008 declined 1.2 percent to $17.1 million, compared to $17.3 million in the third quarter of 2007. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 84.3 percent for the first nine months of 2008, compared to 79.3 percent for the comparable period in 2007. Case persistency for the first nine months of 2008 was 88.9 percent and for the comparable period in 2007 was 87.2 percent.
The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 23.9 percent increase in operating income to $71.5 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $57.7 million in the third quarter of 2007. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 6.8 percent to $376.4 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $352.4 million in the third quarter of 2007. Sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 13.1 percent in the third quarter of 2008, and sales in the individual disability  recently issued line decreased 0.7 percent. Long-term care sales decreased 31.7 percent compared with the year ago quarter, reflecting the Companys strategy to de-emphasize sales of individual long-term care policies.
Unum UK Segment
Unum UK reported operating income of $96.1 million in the third quarter of 2008, a 4.9 percent decrease, compared to $101.0 million in the third quarter of 2007. In local currency, operating income for the third quarter of 2008 increased 1.8 percent to 50.9 million from 50.0 million in the third quarter of 2007. Reported results for the current quarter were adversely impacted by weakening foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting a stronger dollar.
Operating income benefited from a decline in the benefit ratio to 52.4 percent in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 53.3 percent in the third quarter of 2007. The lower benefit ratio for the current quarter was primarily the result of favorable claims experience in the long-term disability and group life lines. Also included in the third quarter results for both 2008 and 2007 is an adjustment to long-term assumptions for claim reserves due to emerging experience and the Companys view of future events. The adjustment increased third quarter of 2008 operating income by $10.4 million, or 5.5 million in local currency; the reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2007 resulted in an increase of $16.6 million, or 8.2 million in local currency. Premium income decreased 9.2 percent to $224.7 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $247.6 million in the third quarter of 2007. In local currency, premium income decreased 3.1 percent to 118.6 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 122.4 million in the third quarter of 2007. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 87.0 percent for the first nine months of 2008, compared to 88.0 percent for the comparable period in 2007. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 74.8 percent for the first nine months of 2008, compared to 71.0 percent for the comparable period in 2007. Sales increased 3.2 percent to $22.9 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $22.2 million in the third quarter of 2007. In local currency, sales for the third quarter of 2008 increased 9.1 percent to 12.0 million, compared to 11.0 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Colonial Life Segment
Colonial Life reported a 5.9 percent increase in operating income to $66.2 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $62.5 million in the third quarter of 2007. Results in the third quarter of 2008 were driven by favorable claims experience in the accident, sickness, and disability line which offset unfavorable claims experience in the life and cancer and critical illness lines. The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2008 was 47.5 percent, compared to 48.6 percent for the same period in 2007. Premium income for the third quarter of 2008 increased to $245.2 million, compared to $227.0 million in the third quarter of 2007. Sales increased 1.9 percent to $75.9 million in the third quarter of 2008 from $74.5 million in the third quarter of 2007. New accounts increased 16.8 percent in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007. Average weekly producers increased 6.2 percent in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007, while average weekly premium per agent decreased 4.1 percent.
Individual Disability
 Closed Block Segment
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $14.2 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $29.4 million in the third quarter of 2007. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 89.2 percent in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 92.4 percent in the prior year third quarter, reflecting favorable risk experience in the quarter. Net investment income for the segment declined 9.8 percent, to $192.7 million in the third quarter of 2008 from $213.6 million in the third quarter of 2007, primarily due to a lower level of assets. During the fourth quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the securitization transaction for this block of business, the Company released excess statutory capital supporting this block of business, with a resulting decrease in net investment income due to the lower asset levels needed to support the allocated capital. This segment also had lower bond call premiums in the third quarter of 2008 relative to the third quarter of 2007. Expenses in the segment were higher reflecting $4.7 million of litigation related expenses in the third quarter of 2008.
Other Segment
The Other segment reported operating income of $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Corporate Segment
The Corporate segment, which includes investment earnings on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, and certain other corporate expenses, reported a loss of $30.3 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared to a loss of $35.7 million in the third quarter of 2007. Interest and debt expense in the third quarter of 2008 was $37.2 million, compared to $43.9 million in the third quarter of 2007.
OTHER INFORMATION
Shares Outstanding
The Companys average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution was 337.9 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared to 360.9 million for the third quarter of 2007. The share count at the end of the third quarter of 2008 was 333.1 million. Shares outstanding for the quarter reflect the repurchase of 12.5 million shares which were repurchased as a result of a previously announced $350 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to the Company of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of its common stock, for a total repurchase of 14.5 million shares. The Company has no further open authorizations for share repurchase and has fully exercised the $700 million authorization established in 2007. The Company expects to discuss its capital management plans for 2009 at its investor presentation in New York City scheduled for November 11, 2008.
Book Value
Book value per common share as of September 30, 2008 was $20.22, compared to $21.70 at September 30, 2007. Excluding net unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at September 30, 2008 was $21.46, compared to $20.36 at September 30, 2007.
OUTLOOK
The Company is maintaining its previously stated guidance for full-year 2008 operating earnings per share of $2.46 to $2.51 per diluted common share and expects to report full year results toward the upper end of the range. The Company expects operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 to be negatively impacted by lower miscellaneous net investment income from a decrease in bond call premiums and the recent decline in value of the British Pound.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business. The Company believes book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Notes to Statistical Supplement
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We also believe that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  In January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  The final settlement occurred during the second quarter of 2008, and in total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreement. 
During August 2008, we repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement with terms similar to the earlier agreement.  The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of our common stock, for a total repurchase of 14.5 million shares.
Financing
During the second quarter of 2008, we retired the remaining $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes.  During the first nine months of 2008, we made principal payments of $35.7 million and $7.5 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC and Tailwind Holdings, LLC respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our first nine months 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.

2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX).  Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations.  The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%.  We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax.  In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and retired $17.5 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes scheduled to mature in 2028.  Pursuant to a cash tender offer, we tendered $23.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038; $99.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.625% notes due 2011; $210.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.375% notes due 2032; and $66.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% notes due 2028.  We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature in 2032.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings, LLC issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings, LLC is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
During 2007, we made principal payments of $17.5 million on our senior secured notes due 2036 which were issued by Tailwind Holdings, LLC.

Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Statement of Position 05-1 (SOP 05-1),
Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts
.  SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments
. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of SOP 05-1 decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109)
.  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109.  Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 increased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $22.7 million.  
2006 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for the claim reassessment process.  Our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of 2006, when actual results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the reassessment process.  We concluded that a change in our initial assumptions, primarily related to the number of claimants for
whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments, was warranted.  We based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time, which was the actual cost related to approximately 20 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.  The characteristics, profile, and cost of those initial 20 percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in 2004 and 2005.  Based on our analysis, in the first quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $86.0 million before tax, or $55.9 million after tax, to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment.
  
The first quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $72.8 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $13.2 million.
In the third quarter of 2006 we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process $325.4 million before tax and $211.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately 55 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.  The third quarter charge was comprised of $310.4 million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and $15.0 million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the
additional time then estimated to complete the process.  Our best estimate of $310.4 million for the reopened claims assumed

that the nature and characteristics of the approximately 45 percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the average profile of the 55 percent already reviewed at that time.  The third quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $291.4 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.0 million. 
Broker Compensation Settlement
In June 2004, we received a subpoena from the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) requesting documents and information relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers or intermediaries and our subsidiaries.  In November 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with the NYAG in the form of an assurance of discontinuance that provided for a national restitution fund of $15.5 million, a fine of $1.9 million, and certain other expenses approximating $1.1 million.
Income Tax
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded income of $2.6 million before tax and approximately $3.9 million after tax attributable to the receipt of interest and tax refunds on prior year tax items in excess of what was previously provided. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $91.9 million as the result of the reversal of tax liabilities related primarily to group relief benefits recognized from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in which our businesses operate.
Financing
In the second quarter of 2006, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we purchased $50.0 million of our outstanding 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.625% notes due 2011.  The cost of the cash tender offer decreased second quarter 2006 income by $17.8 million before tax, or $11.6 million after tax.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, we purchased $32.0 million of our outstanding 6.850% notes due 2015 on the open market.  The cost of the debt purchase decreased fourth quarter 2006 income by $2.7 million before tax, or $1.9 million after tax.
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the units issued in May 2003 occurred in February 2006, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $575.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2008 to 5.997%.  We purchased $400.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated
write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2006 income by $5.3 million before tax, or $3.4 million after tax.  In May 2006, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 43.3 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $575.0 million from the transaction.
In November 2006, Tailwind Holdings, LLC issued $130.0 million of senior, secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon LIBOR plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Tailwind Holdings, LLC is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.

Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123(R)),
Share-Based Payment.  
SFAS 123(R) focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
service in exchange for share-based payments.  The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158),
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
.  SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income.  Also, under SFAS 158, defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations are to be measured as of the date of the
employers fiscal year-end.  The adoption of SFAS 158, which resulted in an $84.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, had no effect on our results of operations.  
2005 Significant Transactions and Events
California Settlement Agreement and Amendment of the Multistate Market Conduct Examination Settlement Agreements
In the third quarter of 2005, certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries entered into a settlement agreement with the California Department of Insurance (DOI), in connection with a market conduct examination and investigation of the subsidiaries disability claims handling practices.  The California DOI had chosen not to join the 2004 multistate settlement agreements our insurance subsidiaries entered into with state insurance regulators of 48 states upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination that became effective on December 21, 2004.  As part of the settlement with the California DOI, we paid a civil penalty of $8.0 million and agreed to change certain practices and policy provisions related to our California business.  The settlement also incorporated claims handling practices previously covered by the multistate settlement agreements and included certain additional claim handling changes.
Based on the settlement agreement and related matters, in the third quarter of 2005 we recorded a charge of $75.0 million before tax, or $51.6 million after tax, comprised of four elements: $14.3 million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the reassessment process; $37.3 million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment; $15.4 million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that are anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented; and the $8.0 million civil penalty.  The charge decreased before-tax operating results for the Unum US segment group disability line of business and supplemental and voluntary lines of business $37.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and the Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.3 million.
Income Tax
In the third quarter of 2005, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $10.8 million related to the finalization of income tax reviews of our U.K. subsidiaries.

In April 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of tax years 1999 through 2001 and issued its revenue agents report (RAR).  Income tax liabilities of approximately $32.0 million that related primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of 2005, all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense.
Disposition
During the third quarter of 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Unum Limited, completed the sale of its Netherlands branch.  The gain on the sale was approximately $5.7 million before tax and $4.0 million after tax.
Closed Block Reinsurance Recapture
During the third quarter of 2005, we recaptured a closed block of individual disability business.  The recaptured business included approximately $1.6 billion in invested assets and $185.0 million of annual premium.  The effective date of the recapture was August 8, 2005.  The underlying operating results of the reinsurance contract, prior to recapture, were reflected
in other income.  The recapture therefore did not have a material impact on operating income for our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment.
