Unum Group Reports Second Quarter 2009 Results
 
 Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $267.2 million ($0.80 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2009, compared to net income of $240.3 million ($0.69 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2008.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
(August 4, 2009)
 
Included in the results for the second quarter of 2009 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $51.4 million ($0.15 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after-tax investment gains of $17.1 million ($0.04 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2008. Net realized after-tax investment gains for the second quarter of 2009 include an after-tax gain of $91.0 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2008. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the second quarter of 2009 is a net after-tax investment loss of $39.6 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to a net after-tax investment gain of $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
 
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $215.8 million ($0.65 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $223.2 million ($0.65 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2008.
 
I am pleased that all of our businesses have continued to perform well despite the challenging economic and financial market conditions, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer.  As we look to the second half of 2009, we remain cautious on the general environment, but confident in our ability to successfully execute our plans and capitalize on opportunities that present themselves to profitably grow our business.
 
Watjen added that given Unums performance through the first six months of the year, the Company is revising its guidance for full year 2009 operating earnings per share to a range of $2.50 to $2.60 from its previous range of $2.45 to $2.55.
 
 
 
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Effective with the fourth quarter of 2008, we made slight modifications to our reporting segments to better align the debt of our securitizations with the business segments and to align the allocation of capital for Unum UK similar to that of Unum US and Colonial Life. Financial results by segment for 2008, as previously reported, have been revised to reflect these reclassifications.

Unum US Segment
 
           Unum US reported operating income of $191.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of 11.5 percent from $171.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. Premium income for the segment declined by 1.9 percent to $1,223.7 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $1,246.9 million in the second quarter of 2008.
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $68.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to operating income of $47.0 million in the second quarter of 2008.  The benefit ratio for the second quarter of 2009 was 87.0 percent compared to 90.5 percent in the second quarter of 2008. Improvements in the benefit ratio continue to reflect the on-going strategic shift for the line, from a large case concentration to a balanced mix of business with a focus on increasing exposure to the core market (employee groups with fewer than 2,000 lives). Results also reflect favorable claim recovery trends; relatively stable claim incidence trends in both the group long-term and short-term disability lines of business relative to the second quarter of 2008; maintenance of pricing discipline, specifically as it relates to the large case market; and the implemented improvements in the claims management process. Premium income in group disability declined 5.7 percent to $541.0 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $573.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. Increasing competition, along with softening economic conditions and the Companys on-going commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection were contributing factors to the decline in the current premium. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the second quarter of 2009 increased by 19.6 percent to $54.3 million compared to $45.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products increased by 18.3 percent to $19.4 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $16.4 million in the second quarter of 2008.  Sales of fully insured group disability products (inclusive of both long-term and short-term disability products) in the Companys core market increased by 11.1 percent in the second quarter of 2009 to $45.0 million from $40.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. Sales of fully insured group disability products in the large case market (employee groups with 2,000 or more lives) increased by 34.7 percent to $28.7 million in the second quarter of 2009, from $21.3 million in the comparable period in 2008. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 88.2 percent for the first six months of 2009, compared to 88.3 percent in the first six months of 2008.  Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 89.0 percent for the first six months of 2009, compared to 83.6 percent for the comparable period in 2008.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 10.3 percent decrease in operating income to $48.7 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $54.3 million in the second quarter of 2008, reflecting lower premium income and higher mortality from the prior year comparable period. Premium income for this line of business declined 2.9 percent to $291.8 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $300.6 million in the second quarter of 2008, reflecting the Companys ongoing disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection, and softening economic conditions.  Sales of fully insured group life products increased by 25.9 percent in the second quarter of 2009 to $48.6 million; in the second quarter of 2008 sales were $38.6 million. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 87.1 percent in the first six months of 2009, compared to 84.8 percent for the comparable period in 2008.

The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 5.7 percent increase in operating income to $74.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $70.3 million in the second quarter of 2008.  The improvement in operating income was driven by favorable risk in the individual disability  recently issued and voluntary benefits lines and premium growth in all three business lines: individual disability  recently issued, long-term care, and voluntary benefits. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 4.9 percent to $390.9 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $372.7 million in the second quarter of 2008.  Sales in the voluntary benefits line of business decreased by 6.1 percent in the second quarter of 2009, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line decreased by 9.4 percent, and long-term care sales decreased 43.6 percent, all relative to the second quarter of 2008.
 
Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $67.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, a 27.3 percent decrease compared to $92.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. In local currency, operating income for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 6.6 percent, to 43.9 million from 47.0 million in the second quarter of 2008. Results for the quarter, when translated into dollars, have been impacted by continuing volatility in the foreign exchange markets, specific to the exchange rate of the dollar to British pound sterling.
 
 
5
 
 
 
The benefit ratio in the second quarter 2009 was 54.4 percent, compared to 58.3 percent in the comparable quarter in 2008, reflecting a lower rate of claim incidence in the both the group long-term disability line and group life line, which was partially offset by slightly lower claim recoveries in the group long-term disability line. The benefit ratio was also favorably impacted by lower inflation on claim reserves associated with group long-term disability policies containing an inflation-linked benefit feature.  Premium income decreased 28.3 percent to $173.4 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $241.7 million in the second quarter of 2008.  In local currency, premium income decreased 9.0 percent to 111.6 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to 122.6 million in the second quarter of 2008.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 88.8 percent for the first six months of 2009, compared to 86.0 percent for the comparable period in 2008. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 77.5 percent for the first six months of 2009, compared to 78.1 percent for the 2008 comparable period. Sales decreased 4.5 percent to $29.5 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $30.9 million in the second quarter of 2008.  In local currency, sales for the second quarter of 2009 increased 21.0 percent to 19.0 million, compared to 15.7 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to sales growth in the Unum UK group life large case market (employee groups with 500 or more lives) and the Unum UK group disability core market segment (fewer than 500 lives).

Colonial Life Segment
 
Colonial Life reported a 4.5 percent increase in operating income to $71.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $68.2 million in the second quarter of 2008.  The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2009 was 46.4 percent, compared to 46.9 percent for the same period in 2008, with a lower benefit ratio in the cancer and critical illness line offsetting a higher benefit ratio in the accident, sickness, and disability line of business.  Premium income for the second quarter of 2009 increased by 3.4 percent to $250.8 million, compared to $242.6 million in the second quarter of 2008.  Sales decreased 3.9 percent to $78.0 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $81.2 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower sales in existing accounts.  New accounts increased 7.4 percent in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008.
 
Individual Disability  Closed Block Segment
 
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $10.0 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $15.2 million in the second quarter of 2008.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 82.0 percent in the second quarter of 2009, compared to 82.4 percent in the second quarter of 2008.  Risk results in this segment remained generally consistent with the trends of the past several quarters, with a slight increase in claim incidence during the second quarter of 2009 relative to the second quarter of last year.  Net investment income for the segment declined 5.5 percent, to $187.4 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $198.4 million in the second quarter of 2008.
 
7
 
 
 
Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $16.0 million in the second quarter 2009, compared to an operating loss of $6.7 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to approximately $10.4 million in increased expenses related to pension costs relative to last years second quarter. Interest and debt expense in the second quarter of 2009 was $25.6 million, compared to $30.6 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower levels of outstanding debt.
 
OTHER INFORMATION
 
Capital Management
 
With the results of the second quarter 2009, the Company continued to exceed its previously announced target capital management metrics. At the end of the second quarter of 2009, combined risk-based capital of approximately 340 percent for its traditional US insurance companies exceeded the Companys 300 percent threshold target, leverage of 18.5 percent remained significantly less than the stated 25 percent target, and holding company liquidity of $475 million was in excess of the Companys minimum target of one years fixed charges, or approximately $230 million.  Leverage is measured as total debt to total capital, which the Company defines as total long-term and short-term debt plus stockholders equity, excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges.  Leverage also excludes the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings, LLC and Northwind Holdings, LLC.

Shares Outstanding
 
The Companys average number of shares (000s) outstanding, assuming dilution, was 331,955.2 for the second quarter of 2009, compared to 346,035.4 for the second quarter of 2008.
 
Book Value
 
Book value per common share as of June 30, 2009 was $22.57, compared to $22.19 at June 30, 2008.  Excluding the net unrealized loss on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at June 30, 2009 was $22.07, compared to $21.77 at June 30, 2008.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The Company is increasing its previously stated guidance for operating earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.55 for full year 2009 and currently anticipates operating earnings for the year to be between $2.50 and $2.60 per diluted common share. The revised guidance includes higher operating earnings in the Companys Unum US segment relative to previously stated expectations and an upward revision to the foreign currency exchange rate assumption for the British pound sterling to $1.60 from $1.50.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage and book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.  For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We also believe that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
During the first six months of 2009, we made principal payments of $3.8 million and $5.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC and Tailwind Holdings, LLC, respectively.  We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009.
Accounting Principle Change
Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 (FSP FAS 115-2 and  FAS 124-2), .  This FSP amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  In January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was
to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  The final settlement occurred during the second quarter of 2008, and in total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreement.

During August 2008, we repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement with terms similar to the earlier agreement.  The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of our common stock, for a total repurchase of 14.5 million shares.
Financing
During 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes and $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes.  We made principal payments of $59.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.
2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX).  Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations.  The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%.  We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007
income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax.  In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.

15.1
 
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and retired $17.5 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes scheduled to mature in 2028.  Pursuant to a cash tender offer, we tendered $23.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038; $99.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.625% notes due 2011; $210.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.375% notes due 2032; and $66.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% notes due 2028.  We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature
in 2032.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
During 2007, we made principal payments of $17.5 million on our senior secured notes due 2036 which were issued by Tailwind Holdings. 
Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Statement of Position 05-1 (SOP 05-1), .  SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97, .  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of SOP 05-1 decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.
Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), .  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109.  Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 increased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $22.7 million.

2006 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for the claim reassessment process.  Our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of 2006, when actual
results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the
reassessment process.  We concluded that a change in our initial assumptions, primarily related to the
number of claimants for whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments, was warranted.  We based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time, which was the actual cost related to approximately 20 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.

characteristics, profile, and cost of those initial 20 percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in 2004 and 2005.  Based on our analysis, in the first quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $86.0 million
before tax, or $55.9 million after tax, to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment.The first quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $72.8 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $13.2 million.
 
 
In the third quarter of 2006 we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process $325.4 million before tax and $211.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately 55 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.  The third quarter charge was comprised of $310.4 million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and $15.0 million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the
additional time then estimated to complete the process. Our best estimate of $310.4 million for the reopened claims assumed that the nature and characteristics of the approximately 45 percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the average profile of the 55 percent already reviewed at that time.  The third quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $291.4 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.0 million. 
Broker Compensation Settlement
In June 2004, we received a subpoena from the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) requesting documents and information relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers or intermediaries and our subsidiaries.  In November 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with the NYAG in the form of an assurance of discontinuance that provided for a national restitution fund of $15.5 million, a fine of $1.9 million, and certain other expenses approximating $1.1 million.
Income Tax
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded income of $2.6 million before tax and approximately $3.9 million after tax attributable to the receipt of interest and tax refunds on prior year tax items in excess of what was previously provided.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $91.9 million as the result of the reversal of tax liabilities related primarily to group relief benefits recognized from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in which our businesses operate.
Financing
 
In the second quarter of 2006, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we purchased $50.0 million of our outstanding 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding
7.625% notes due 2011.  The cost of the cash tender offer decreased second quarter 2006 income by $17.8 million before tax, or $11.6 million after tax.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, we purchased $32.0 million of our outstanding 6.850% notes due 2015 on the open market.  The cost of the debt purchase decreased fourth quarter 2006 income by $2.7 million before tax, or $1.9 million after tax.

The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the units issued in May 2003 occurred in February 2006, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $575.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2008 to 5.997%.  We purchased $400.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated
write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2006 income by $5.3 million before tax, or $3.4 million after tax.  In May 2006, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 43.3 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $575.0 million from the transaction.
In November 2006, Tailwind Holdings issued $130.0 million of senior, secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon LIBOR plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Tailwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
Accounting Principle Changes
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123(R)), SFAS 123(R) focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee service in exchange for share-based payments.  The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Share-Based Payment.  
Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158), .  SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income.  Also, under SFAS 158, defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations are to be measured as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end.  The adoption of SFAS 158, which resulted in an $84.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, had no effect on our results of operations.
