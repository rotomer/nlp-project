Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $221.1 million ($0.66 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2009, compared to net income of $108.0 million ($0.32 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2008.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
(November 3, 2009)
 
Included in the results for the third quarter of 2009 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $9.5 million ($0.02 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after-tax investment losses of $108.9 million ($0.32 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2008. Net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2009 include an after-tax gain of $28.9 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax loss of $44.1 million in the third quarter of 2008. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2009 is a net realized after-tax investment loss of $19.4 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to a net after-tax investment loss of $64.8 million in the third quarter of 2008.
 
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $211.6 million ($0.64 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $216.9 million ($0.64 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2008.
 
I am pleased with our results for the third quarter, as well as our continued strong position in our markets, in what remains a challenging economic environment, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. While we expect the environment will remain challenging, we are well positioned to profitably grow our business as general business conditions improve and, in the meantime, continue to generate solid results and maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position.

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Effective with the fourth quarter of 2008, we made slight modifications to our reporting segments to better align the debt of our securitizations with the business segments and to align the allocation of capital for Unum UK similar to that of Unum US and Colonial Life. Financial results by segment for 2008, as previously reported, have been revised to reflect these reclassifications.
 
Unum US Segment
 
 
           Unum US reported operating income of $197.1 million in the third quarter of 2009, an increase of 14.9 percent from $171.6 million in the third quarter of 2008. Premium income for the segment declined by 1.9 percent to $1,215.2 million in the third quarter of 2009; premium income in the third quarter of 2008 was $1,239.1 million.
 
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $75.0 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to operating income of $54.6 million in the third quarter of 2008.  The benefit ratio for the third quarter of 2009 was 85.3 percent compared to 89.3 percent in the third quarter of 2008. Improvement in the benefit ratio in the third quarter reflects a generally consistent rate of claim recoveries and net favorable claims experience in the group long-term disability line of business as compared to the third quarter 2008. Results for the group disability line also continue to reflect the on-going strategic shift for the line, from a large case concentration to a balanced mix of business with a focus on increasing exposure to the core market (employee groups with fewer than 2,000 lives); maintenance of pricing discipline, specifically as it relates to the large case market; and the implemented improvements in the claims management process. Premium income in group disability declined 4.4 percent to $537.4 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $562.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. Increasing competition, along with softening economic conditions and the Companys on-going commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection, were contributing factors to the decline in the current premium. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the third quarter of 2009 decreased by 34.1 percent to $20.7 million compared to $31.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products increased by 29.0 percent to $13.8 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 87.3 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared to 87.9 percent in the first nine months of 2008. Case persistency for this line was 87.2 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared to 89.3 percent for the comparable period in 2008. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 88.5 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared to 82.1 percent for the comparable period in 2008. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 86.2 percent for the first nine months of 2009, comparable to 88.1 percent for the first nine months of 2008.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 1.8 percent decrease in operating income to $50.0 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $50.9 million in the third quarter of 2008. Premium income for this line of business declined 2.3 percent to $293.4 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $300.3 million in the third quarter of 2008, reflecting the Companys ongoing disciplined approach to pricing, renewals, and risk selection, and softening economic conditions.  Sales of fully insured group life products increased by 63.7 percent in the third quarter of 2009 to $28.0 million; in the third quarter of 2008 sales were $17.1 million. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 86.8 percent in the first nine months of 2009, compared to 84.3 percent for the comparable period in 2008. Case persistency in the group life line of business for the first nine months of 2009 was 86.9 percent compared to 88.9 percent for the comparable period in 2008.

The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 9.1 percent increase in operating income to $72.1 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $66.1 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 2.1 percent to $384.4 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $376.4 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Relative to the third quarter of 2008, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business decreased by 17.8 percent in the third quarter of 2009, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line decreased by 19.2 percent, and long-term care sales decreased 47.9 percent.
 
Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $58.7 million in the third quarter of 2009, a decrease of 36.5 percent from $92.5 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Results for the quarter, when translated into dollars, have been impacted by continuing volatility in the exchange rate of the dollar to British pound sterling.  In local currency, operating income for the third quarter of 2009 decreased 26.9 percent, to 35.8 million from 49.0 million in the third quarter of 2008.

The benefit ratio in the third quarter 2009 was 50.2 percent, compared to 52.4 percent in the comparable quarter in 2008. The lower benefit ratio for the current quarter is reflective of the impact of lower general inflation on claim reserves associated with group long-term disability policies containing an inflation-linked benefit increase feature as well as a decline in the level of claim incidence in the group long-term disability line.  Premium income decreased 24.5 percent to $169.7 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $224.7 million in the third quarter of 2008.  In local currency, premium income decreased 12.8 percent to 103.4 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to 118.6 million in the third quarter of 2008.  In local currency, net investment income in the quarter declined by 43.2 percent compared to the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to the impact of lower inflation which resulted in lower returns on inflation-indexed bonds.  These bonds match the claim reserves associated with certain group long-term disability policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in disability benefits. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 87.7 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared to 87.0 percent for the comparable period in 2008. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 78.2 percent for the first nine months of 2009, compared to 74.8 percent for the 2008 comparable period. Sales increased 40.2 percent to $32.1 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $22.9 million in the third quarter of 2008.  In local currency, sales for the third quarter of 2009 increased 63.3 percent to 19.6 million, compared to 12.0 million in the third quarter of 2008.
 
Colonial Life Segment
 
Colonial Life reported a 6.3 percent increase in operating income to $70.4 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $66.2 million in the third quarter of 2008.  The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2009 was 48.2 percent, compared to 47.5 percent for the same period in 2008. The increase in the benefit ratio for the quarter was attributable to a higher level of paid claims in the cancer and critical illness line of business.  Premium income for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 3.4 percent to $253.5 million compared to $245.2 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Sales increased 3.4 percent to $78.5 million in the third quarter of 2009 from $75.9 million in the third quarter of 2008, as sales growth in the public sector market offset a slight decline in the commercial market segment.  New accounts increased 16.7 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008 and average weekly producers increased 7.6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2008.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 81.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009, compared to 81.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008.

Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $13.7 million in the third quarter 2009, compared to $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to a decrease in net investment income resulting from lower levels of assets and lower interest rates on short-term investments as well as an increase in pension costs.

Book Value
 
Book value per common share as of September 30, 2009 was $24.86 compared to $20.22 at September 30, 2008.  Excluding the net unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain on cash flow hedges, book value per common share at September 30, 2009 was $22.61, compared to $21.46 at September 30, 2008.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The Company is maintaining its previously stated guidance for full year 2009 and anticipates operating earnings per share for the year to be in a range of $2.50 and $2.60 per diluted common share.
 
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage and book value per common share excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.  For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We also believe that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.  In addition, these notes are effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries.
During the first nine months of 2009, we made principal payments of $19.9 million and $7.5 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC and Tailwind Holdings, LLC, respectively.  We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028 and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Accounting Developments
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We adopted this standard effective July 1, 2009.  This standard had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
(continued on next page)

ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The measure of impairment remains fair value.  Under the standard, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  In January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  The final settlement occurred during the second quarter of 2008, and in total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreement. 
During August 2008, we repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement with terms similar to the earlier agreement.  The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of our common stock, for a total repurchase of 14.5 million shares.
Financing
During 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes and $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes.  We made principal payments of $59.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.

2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX).  Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations.  The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%.  We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax.  In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and retired $17.5 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes scheduled to mature in 2028.  Pursuant to a cash tender offer, we tendered $23.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038; $99.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.625% notes due 2011; $210.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.375% notes due 2032; and $66.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% notes due 2028.  We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature in 2032.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin.

Accounting Developments
ASC 944 Financial Services - Insurance
In September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 944, to provide guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in U.S. GAAP provisions.  We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.
ASC 740 Income Taxes
In June 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 740, to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and to provide guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.  We adopted this standard January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $22.7 million.
2006 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for the claim reassessment process.  Our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of 2006, when actual results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the reassessment process.  We concluded that a change in our initial assumptions, primarily related to the number of claimants for whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments, was warranted.  We based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time, which was the actual cost related to approximately 20 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.  The characteristics, profile, and cost of those initial 20 percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in 2004 and 2005.  Based on our analysis, in the first quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $86.0 million before tax, or $55.9 million after tax, to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment.The first quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $72.8 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $13.2 million.

In the third quarter of 2006 we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process $325.4 million before tax and $211.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately 55 percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed.  The third quarter charge was comprised of $310.4 million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and $15.0 million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the additional time then estimated to complete the process. Our best estimate of $310.4 million for the reopened claims assumed that the nature and characteristics of the approximately 45 percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the average profile of the 55 percent already reviewed at that time.  The third quarter charge decreased before-tax operating results for our Unum US group disability line of business $291.4 million and our Individual Disability  Closed Block segment $34.0 million. 
Broker Compensation Settlement
In June 2004, we received a subpoena from the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) requesting documents and information relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers or intermediaries and our subsidiaries.  In November 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with the NYAG in the form of an assurance of discontinuance that provided for a national restitution fund of $15.5 million, a fine of $1.9 million, and certain other expenses approximating $1.1 million.
Income Tax
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded income of $2.6 million before tax and approximately $3.9 million after tax attributable to the receipt of interest and tax refunds on prior year tax items in excess of what was previously provided. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $91.9 million as the result of the reversal of tax liabilities related primarily to group relief benefits recognized from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction in which our businesses operate.
Financing
In the second quarter of 2006, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we purchased $50.0 million of our outstanding 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.625% notes due 2011.  The cost of the cash tender offer decreased second quarter 2006 income by $17.8 million before tax, or $11.6 million after tax.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, we purchased $32.0 million of our outstanding 6.850% notes due 2015 on the open market.  The cost of the debt purchase decreased fourth quarter 2006 income by $2.7 million before tax, or $1.9 million after tax.

We purchased $400.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2006 income by $5.3 million before tax, or $3.4 million after tax.  In May 2006, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 43.3 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $575.0 million from the transaction.

Accounting Developments
ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation
In December 2004, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 718, for accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee service in exchange for share-based payments.  We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2006.  The adoption of the provisions of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
ASC 715 Compensation - Retirement Benefits
In September 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 715, to require an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income.  Also, under the provisions of this standard, defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations are to be measured as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end.  We adopted this standard effective December 31, 2006.  The adoption of this standard, which resulted in an $84.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, had no effect on our results of operations.
