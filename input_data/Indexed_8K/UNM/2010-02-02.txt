 Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $199.4 million ($0.60 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to net income of $41.8 million ($0.13 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2008.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
(February 2, 2010)
 
Included in the results for the fourth quarter of 2009 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $18.9 million ($0.06 per diluted common share), compared to $167.6 million ($0.50 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net realized after-tax investment losses for the fourth quarter of 2009 include an after-tax gain of $22.7 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax loss of $120.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Also included in net realized after-tax investment losses for the fourth quarter of 2009 is a net realized after-tax investment loss of $41.6 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $218.3 million ($0.66 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $209.4 million ($0.63 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
The Company had another solid quarter and we closed the year well positioned for the year ahead, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer.  While we believe that the general business and economic environment will continue to pose challenges, the actions we have taken the past several years have positioned us well and provide us with significant operating and financial flexibility.

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Unum US Segment
 
           Unum US reported operating income of $203.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 11.2 percent from $182.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Premium income for the segment declined 3.1 percent to $1,207.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009; premium income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $1,246.6 million.
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $72.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to operating income of $59.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 84.6 percent compared to 88.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting a generally consistent rate of claim recoveries and net favorable claims experience in the group long-term disability line of business as compared to the fourth quarter 2008. Premium income in group disability declined 5.9 percent to $535.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $569.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Increased competition, along with soft economic conditions and the Companys ongoing commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection, were contributing factors to the decline in the current premium. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 2.6 percent to $75.4 million, compared to $77.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products increased 12.3 percent to $34.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $31.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 86.9 percent in 2009, compared to 87.8 percent in 2008. Case persistency for this line was 87.4 percent in 2009, compared to 89.2 percent in 2008. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 86.8 percent in 2009, compared to 82.1 percent in 2008. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 86.5 percent in 2009, compared to 88.2 percent in 2008.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 5.2 percent decrease in operating income to $47.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $50.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Premium income for this line of business declined 2.6 percent to $289.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $297.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the same conditions affecting group disability premium income.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products declined 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $84.3 million from $91.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 86.9 percent in 2009, compared to 83.8 percent in 2008. Case persistency in the group life line of business for 2009 was 87.2 percent compared to 89.1 percent in 2008.
 
The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 13.9 percent increase in operating income to $82.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $72.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 0.7 percent to $382.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $380.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $61.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 12.3 percent from $54.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Results for the quarter, when translated into dollars, benefitted from the exchange rate of the dollar to British pound sterling.  In local currency, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 8.7 percent, to 37.6 million from 34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter 2009 was 59.6 percent, compared to 63.0 percent in the comparable quarter in 2008. The lower benefit ratio for the current quarter reflects net favorable claims experience in the group long-term disability line, which was partially offset by higher paid claims in the group life line.  Premium income decreased 1.3 percent to $180.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $182.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  In local currency, premium income decreased 4.8 percent to 110.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to 115.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 88.6 percent in 2009, compared to 87.4 percent in 2008. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 80.1 percent in 2009, compared to 74.9 percent in 2008. Sales increased 55.6 percent to $42.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $27.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, aided in part by the exit of another large insurance provider from the U.K. group risk market.  In local currency, sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 47.7 percent to 25.7 million, compared to 17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Colonial Life Segment
 
Colonial Life reported a 3.0 percent increase in operating income to $68.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $66.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 48.5 percent, compared to 48.3 percent for the same period in 2008.  The benefit ratio in the accident, sickness, and disability line was slightly lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 relative to the year ago quarter, while the benefit ratios in the life and cancer and critical illness lines were both higher than the year ago quarter due to higher claims experience.  Premium income for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 3.3 percent to $257.4 million, compared to $249.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Sales increased 3.7 percent to $119.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 from $115.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, driven primarily by a strong level of sales in the public sector market.  New accounts increased 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and average weekly producers increased 7.9 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Individual Disability  Closed Block Segment
 
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 81.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to 82.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Risk results in this segment remained generally consistent with the trends of the past several quarters. 
 
Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $16.6 million in the fourth quarter 2009, compared to $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to higher interest expense as well as an increase in pension costs.  The fourth quarter of 2008 also included $7.6 million of other income related to a refund of interest primarily attributable to prior tax years.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt as well as unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure.  For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.  We also believe that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
During 2009, we made principal payments of $48.0 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC and Tailwind Holdings, LLC, respectively.  We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028 and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Accounting Developments
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We
adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009.  This adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
(continued on next page)

ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The measure of impairment remains fair value.  Under the standard, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  In January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  The final settlement occurred during the second quarter of 2008, and in total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreement. 
During August 2008, we repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement with terms similar to the earlier agreement.  The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of our common stock, for a total repurchase of 14.5 million shares.
Financing
During 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes due May 2008 and $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes due May 2008.  We made principal payments of $59.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.

15.1
2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX).  Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations.  The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%.  We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax.  In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and retired $17.5 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes scheduled to mature in 2028.  Pursuant to a cash tender offer, we tendered $23.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038; $99.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.625% notes due 2011; $210.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.375% notes due 2032; and $66.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% notes due 2028.  We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature in 2032.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.

Accounting Developments
ASC 944 Financial Services - Insurance
In September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants modified GAAP to provide accounting guidance, now included in ASC 944, for modifications or exchanges of certain insurance contracts.  This modification provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of certain insurance and investment contracts.  We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this guidance decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.
ASC 740 Income Taxes
In June 2006, the FASB issued an interpretation to provide authoritative accounting guidance, now included in ASC 740, for income tax positions.  This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Additionally, this interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of adopting this interpretation, effective January 1, 2007, increased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $22.7 million.
