Net realized after-tax investment gains for the first quarter of 2010 include an after-tax gain of $11.9 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $15.4 million in the first quarter of 2009.

Our first quarter results mark a continuation of many of the positive operating trends we have experienced over the past several quarters  solid risk experience, excellent investment results, and a very strong capital position, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer.  While it is a challenge to grow our premium income in the present economic and employment environment, I am very encouraged by the profitability of our business combined with our solid new business activity and strong persistency levels.
 
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Unum US Segment
 
Unum US reported operating income of $199.2 million in the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 8.5 percent from $183.6 million in the first quarter of 2009. Premium income for the segment declined 0.8 percent to $1,216.1 million in the first quarter of 2010; premium income in the first quarter of 2009 was $1,226.3 million.
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $75.8 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to operating income of $57.7 million in the first quarter of 2009.  The 31.4 percent increase in operating income was primarily driven by an improvement in the benefit ratio for the first quarter of 2010 to 84.2 percent, compared to 88.0 percent in the first quarter of 2009.  This improvement reflected a higher rate of claim recoveries for group long-term disability which was offset partially by an increase in paid claim incidence rates for group long-term and short-term disability. Premium income in group disability declined 4.4 percent to $521.8 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $545.7 million in the first quarter of 2009. On-going price compe tition, along with challenging economic conditions and the Companys continued commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection, were contributing factors to the decline in the current premium. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the first quarter of 2010 decreased 12.9 percent to $27.6 million, compared to $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2009. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products decreased 10.1 percent to $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2009.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 90.0 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 87.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Case persistency for this line was 88.6 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 87.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 89.4 percent in the first quarter of 2010, c ompared to 88.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 87.6 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 86.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 6.0 percent increase in operating income to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $48.3 million in the first quarter of 2009. Premium income for this line of business increased 2.8 percent to $296.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $288.0 million in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting favorable persistency in the group life line.  The benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2010 was consistent with the first quarter of 2009.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products declined 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 2010 to $32.0 million from $34.7 million in the first quarter of 2009. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 92.3 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 86.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Case persistency in the group life line of business for the first quarter of 2010 was 88.3 percent compared to 87.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009.

The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported a 7.0 percent decrease in operating income to $72.2 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $77.6 million in the first quarter of 2009.  The decline is primarily attributable to unfavorable risk experience in individual long-term care as well as higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs resulting from lower persistency for certain issue years.  Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 1.4 percent to $398.2 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $392.6 million in the first quarter of 2009.  Relative to the first quarter of 2009, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2010, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line de creased 38.9 percent, and group long-term care sales decreased 22.9 percent.
 
Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $60.6 million in the first quarter of 2010, a decrease of 2.7 percent from $62.3 million in the first quarter of 2009.  Results for the quarter, when translated into dollars, benefitted from the exchange rate of the dollar to British pound sterling.  In local currency, operating income for the first quarter of 2010 decreased 10.4 percent, to 38.8 million from 43.3 million in the first quarter of 2009.
 
The benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2010 was 63.1 percent, compared to 53.3 percent in the comparable quarter in 2009. The higher benefit ratio for the current quarter reflects unfavorable claims experience in the group life line of business and a slight increase in incidence for group long-term disability.  Premium income increased 1.7 percent to $165.8 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $163.0 million in the first quarter of 2009.  In local currency, premium income decreased 6.5 percent to 106.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 113.5 million in the first quarter of 2009. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 90.6 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 90.8 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Persistency in the group life li ne of business was 94.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 74.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Sales increased 23.5 percent to $24.2 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2009.  In local currency, sales for the first quarter of 2010 increased 13.2 percent to 15.4 million, compared to 13.6 million in the first quarter of 2009.

Colonial Life Segment
 
 
Colonial Life reported a 3.0 percent increase in operating income to $73.0 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $70.9 million in the first quarter of 2009.  The benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2010 was 47.1 percent, compared to 46.3 percent for the same period in 2009.  The benefit ratio increase resulted from a higher benefit ratio in the accident, sickness, and disability line which was partially offset by lower benefit ratios in the life and cancer and critical illness lines of business.  Premium income for the first quarter of 2010 increased 4.6 percent to $265.1 million, compared to $253.4 million in the first quarter of 2009.  Sales increased 8.4 percent to $73.3 million in the first quarter of 2010 from $67.6 million in the first quarter of 2009, driven primarily by a st rong level of sales to new accounts.  New accounts increased 30.8 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009, and average weekly producers increased 8.5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009.

Individual Disability  Closed Block Segment
 
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $11.3 million in the first quarter of 2009.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 84.5 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 81.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower claim recoveries and slightly higher claim incidence rates.  Net investment income increased 2.3 percent to $190.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $186.4 million in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting a higher level of miscellaneous investment income.
 
Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $8.9 million in the first quarter 2010, compared to $12.9 million in the first quarter of 2009.  The improvement in results is primarily due to higher net investment income partially offset by increased interest expense.
 
OTHER INFORMATION

Shares Outstanding
 
The Companys average number of shares (000s) outstanding, assuming dilution was 333,524.7 for the first quarter of 2010, compared to 330,964.5 for the first quarter of 2009.
 
Book Value
 
Book value per common share as of March 31, 2010 was $26.38 compared to $19.39 at March 31, 2009.
 
Income Tax Item
 
Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2010 includes a non-cash charge of $10.2 million to reflect the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 that were signed into law in March 2010.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent the Companys future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Employers that receive the subsidy must re cognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The Company is maintaining its previously stated outlook for full year 2010 and anticipates operating earnings growth for the year to be in a range of four percent to six percent.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding certain tax items as well as realized investment gains and losses, which may be recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt as well as unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow he dges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure.  For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.  We also believ e that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2010 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
During the first three months of 2010, we made principal payments of $20.8 million and $2.5 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings) and Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind Holdings), respectively.  We also purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.
Tax Law Change
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted.  Our inc ome tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million to reflect the impact of the tax law change.
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

During 2009, we made principal payments of $48.0 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028 and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008.
 
Accounting Developments
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009.  This adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The measure of impairment remains fair value.  Under the standard, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retai ned earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  In January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  The final settlement occurred during the second quarter of 2008, and in total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreemen t.
 
(continued on next page)
 
15.1
 
 
During August 2008, we repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement with terms similar to the earlier agreement.  The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of our common stock, for a total repurchase of 14.5 million shares.
Financing
During 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes due May 2009 and $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes due May 2008.  We made principal payments of $59.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.
2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.
Disposition
During the first quarter of 2007, we closed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary GENEX Services, Inc. (GENEX).  Financial results for GENEX are reported as discontinued operations.  The after-tax gain recognized on the sale was $6.2 million.
Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%.  We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax.  In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.

We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature in 2032.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
During 2007, we made principal payments of $17.5 million on our senior secured notes due 2036 which were issued by Tailwind Holdings. 
Accounting Developments
ASC 944 Financial Services - Insurance
In September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants modified GAAP to provide accounting guidance, now included in ASC 944, for modifications or exchanges of certain insurance contracts.  This modification provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of certain insurance and investment contracts.  We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this guidance decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.
ASC 740 Income Taxes
In June 2006, the FASB issued an interpretation to provide authoritative accounting guidance, now included in ASC 740, for income tax positions.  This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Additionally, this interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of adopting this interpretation, effective January 1, 2007, increased our 2007 opening balanc e of retained earnings $22.7 million.
