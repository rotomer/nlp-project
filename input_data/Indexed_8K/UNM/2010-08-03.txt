 Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $209.7 million ($0.63 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2010, compared to net income of $267.2 million ($0.80 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2009.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
(August 3, 2010)
 
Included in the results for the second quarter of 2010 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $18.9 million ($0.06 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after-tax gains of $51.4 million ($0.15 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2009. Net realized after-tax investment losses for the second quarter of 2010 include an after-tax loss of $15.3 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $91.0 million in the second quarter of 2009. Also included in net realized after-tax investment losses for the second quarter of 2010 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $3.6 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to net after-tax losses of $39.6 million in the second quarter of 2009.
 
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $228.6 million ($0.69 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $215.8 million ($0.65 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2009.
 
Although the environment remains challenging, we reported another strong quarter with solid risk and investment results, and a very strong capital position, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer.  Our focus going forward will continue to be on executing our disciplined business plan and maintaining our financial flexibility.

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Unum US Segment
 
           Unum US reported operating income of $216.0 million in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 12.9 percent from $191.3 million in the second quarter of 2009. Premium income for the segment declined 0.6 percent to $1,216.5 million in the second quarter of 2010; premium income in the second quarter of 2009 was $1,223.7 million.  Net investment income for the segment increased 4.8 percent to $318.7 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $304.1 million in the second quarter of 2009, reflecting a slight increase in miscellaneous net investment income.
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $84.1 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to operating income of $68.3 million in the second quarter of 2009.  The 23.1 percent increase in operating income was primarily driven by an improvement in the benefit ratio for the second quarter of 2010 to 84.6 percent, compared to 87.0 percent in the second quarter of 2009.  The lower benefit ratio resulted from a higher rate of claim recoveries for group long-term disability which was offset partially by a higher level of claim incidence rates for group long-term and short-term disability. Premium income in group disability declined 3.8 percent to $520.7 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $541.0 million in the second quarter of 2009. On-go ing price competition, along with challenging economic conditions which negatively impact employment levels and wage growth and the Companys continued commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection, were contributing factors to the decline in the current premium. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the second quarter of 2010 decreased 40.7 percent to $32.2 million, compared to $54.3 million in the second quarter of 2009. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products decreased 11.9 percent to $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $19.4 million in the second quarter of 2009.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 90.2 percent in the first half of 2010, compared to 88.2 percent in the first half of 2009. Case persistency for this line was 88.3 percent in the first half of 2010, compared to 87.6 percent in the first half of 2009. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 89.2 percent in the first half of 2010, compared to 89.0 percent in the first half of 2009. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 87.4 percent in the first half of 2010, compared to 86.7 percent in the first half of 2009.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 5.7 percent increase in operating income to $51.5 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $48.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. Premium income for this line of business increased 2.0 percent to $297.7 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $291.8 million in the second quarter of 2009, reflecting favorable persistency.  The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2010 was 70.3 percent compared to 70.5 percent in the second quarter of 2009, reflecting consistent risk experience in this line of business.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products declined 25.5 percent in the second quarter of 2010 to $40.0 million from $53.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. Premium persistency i n the group life line of business was 92.1 percent in the first half of 2010, compared to 87.1 percent in the first half of 2009. Case persistency in the group life line of business for the first half of 2010 was 88.3 percent compared to 87.5 percent in the first half of 2009.

The Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines of business reported an 8.2 percent increase in operating income to $80.4 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $74.3 million in the second quarter of 2009.  The increase is attributable to higher income in the voluntary benefits and long-term care lines of business.  Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 1.8 percent to $398.1 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $390.9 million in the second quarter of 2009.  Relative to the second quarter of 2009, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 50.8 percent in the second quarter of 2010, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line decreased 11.2 percent, and group long-term care sales increased 6.1 percent.
 
Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $52.9 million in the second quarter of 2010, a decrease of 21.4 percent from $67.3 million in the second quarter of 2009.  In local currency, operating income for the second quarter of 2010 decreased 18.9 percent, to 35.6 million from 43.9 million in the second quarter of 2009.
 
The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2010 was 66.0 percent, compared to 54.4 percent in the comparable quarter in 2009. The higher benefit ratio for the current quarter reflects the decline in premium income, less favorable claims experience in the group life line of business, and a slightly higher level of incidence for group long-term disability relative to the historically low levels of incidence incurred in the year ago quarter.  The higher benefit ratio also reflects the impact of an increase in the reserves for future claims payments related to inflation linked policies which is largely offset by an increase in investment income for inflation linked bonds.  Premium income, in local currency, decreased 8.2 percent to 102.5 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 111.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 90.7 percent in the first half of 2010, compared to 88.8 percent in the first half of 2009. Persistency in the group life line of business was 92.0 percent in the first half of 2010, compared to 77.5 percent in the first half of 2009. Sales increased 11.2 percent to $32.8 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $29.5 million in the second quarter of 2009.  In local currency, sales for the second quarter of 2010 increased 15.8 percent to 22.0 million, compared to 19.0 million in the second quarter of 2009.

Colonial Life Segment
 
Colonial Life reported a 3.6 percent increase in operating income to $73.9 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $71.3 million in the second quarter of 2009.  The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2010 was 48.3 percent, compared to 46.4 percent for the same period in 2009.  The benefit ratio increase resulted from higher benefit ratios in the accident, sickness, and disability line and cancer and critical illness line which were partially offset by a lower benefit ratio in the life line of business.  Premium income for the second quarter of 2010 increased 6.7 percent to $267.7 million, compared to $250.8 million in the second quarter of 2009.  Sales increased 7.6 percent to $83.9 million in the second quarter of 2010 from $78.0 million in the second quarter of 2009, driven by st rong sales in the commercial market which offset a decline in sales in the public sector market.  New accounts increased 13.6 percent in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009, and average weekly producers increased 9.7 percent compared to the second quarter of 2009.

Individual Disability  Closed Block Segment
 
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $12.4 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $10.0 million in the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to a lower level of expenses.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 85.4 percent in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 82.0 percent in the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower claim recoveries, partially offset by lower claim incidence rates. 
 
Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $17.6 million in the second quarter 2010, compared to $16.0 million in the second quarter of 2009.  Higher net investment income in this years second quarter was offset by increased interest expense and increased operating expenses, primarily caused by increased litigation costs in the second quarter of 2010.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding certain tax items as well as realized investment gains and losses, which may be recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt as well as unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow he dges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure.  For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.  We also believ e that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2010 Significant Transactions and Events
Share Repurchase Program
In May 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of Unum Groups common stock during a one-year period.  During the second quarter of 2010, we repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares, at a cost of approximately $129.8 million, under this program.  The shares of stock repurchased have been classified as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.
Financing
During the first six months of 2010, we made principal payments of $42.7 million and $5.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings) and Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind Holdings), respectively.  We also purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.
Tax Law Change
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted.  Our inc ome tax expense for the first six months of 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change.
 
 
 
 
 
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
During 2009, we made principal payments of $48.0 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028 and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Accounting Developments
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009.  This adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The measure of impairment remains fair value.  Under the standard, an other-than-temporary
impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
 
 
 
 
 
 
2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  In January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  The final settlement occurred during the second quarter of 2008, and in total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreemen t. 
During August 2008, we repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement with terms similar to the earlier agreement.  The final settlement occurred during October 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of approximately 2.0 million additional shares of our common stock, for a total repurchase of 14.5 million shares.
Financing
During 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes due May 2009 and $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes due May 2008.  We made principal payments of $59.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.
2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.

Financing
The scheduled remarketing of the senior note element of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units (units) issued in May 2004 occurred in February 2007, as stipulated by the terms of the original offering, and we reset the interest rate on $300.0 million of senior notes due May 15, 2009 to 5.859%.  We purchased $150.0 million of the senior notes in the remarketing which were subsequently retired.  The associated write-off of deferred debt costs decreased first quarter of 2007 income by $2.4 million before tax, or $1.6 million after tax.  In May 2007, we settled the purchase contract element of the units by issuing 17.7 million shares of common stock.  We received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million from the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2007, we purchased $34.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.85% notes due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our second quarter 2007 income approximately $0.8 million before tax, or $0.6 million after tax.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and retired $17.5 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes scheduled to mature in 2028.  Pursuant to a cash tender offer, we tendered $23.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038; $99.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.625% notes due 2011; $210.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.375% notes due 2032; and $66.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% notes due 2028.  We also called and retired all $150.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7.25% notes scheduled to mature in 2032.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our fourth quarter 2007 income approximately $55.6 million before tax, or $36.1 million after tax.
In October 2007, Northwind Holdings issued $800.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.  Interest on the notes is variable based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin.  None of Unum Group or any other affiliate of Northwind Holdings is an obligor or guarantor on the notes.
During 2007, we made principal payments of $17.5 million on our senior secured notes due 2036 which were issued by Tailwind Holdings. 
Accounting Developments
ASC 944 Financial Services - Insurance
In September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants modified GAAP to provide accounting guidance, now included in ASC 944, for modifications or exchanges of certain insurance contracts.  This modification provides guidance on
accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of certain insurance and investment contracts.  We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this guidance decreased our 2007 opening balance of retained earnings $445.2 million.
 
 
 
 
 
 
ASC 740 Income Taxes
In June 2006, the FASB issued an interpretation to provide authoritative accounting guidance, now included in ASC 740, for income tax positions.  This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Additionally, this interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of adopting this interpretation, effective January 1, 2007, increased our 2007 opening balanc e of retained earnings $22.7 million.
