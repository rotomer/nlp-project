 Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $220.8 million ($0.68 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2010, compared to net income of $221.1 million ($0.66 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2009.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
(November 2, 2010)
 
Included in the results for the third quarter of 2010 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $0.9 million (less than $0.01 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after-tax gains of $9.5 million ($0.02 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2009. Net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2010 include an after-tax gain of $1.1 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $28.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the third quarter of 2010 are net realized after-tax investment losses of $0.2 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to net after-tax losses o f $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
 
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $219.9 million ($0.68 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $211.6 million ($0.64 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2009.
 
Our overall third quarter results met our expectations as the positive results in our Unum US and Colonial Life operations offset lower income in Unum UK, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer.  While the environment remains challenging, our continued strong operating performance and capital position provide us with significant financial flexibility, and we remain very well positioned to effectively manage through this environment.

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Unum US Segment
 
                Unum US reported operating income of $204.7 million in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of 3.9 percent from $197.1 million in the third quarter of 2009. Premium income for the segment declined 0.4 percent to $1,210.6 million in the third quarter of 2010; premium income in the third quarter of 2009 was $1,215.2 million.
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $77.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to operating income of $75.0 million in the third quarter of 2009.  The 3.7 percent increase in operating income was primarily driven by an improvement in the benefit ratio for the third quarter of 2010 to 84.6 percent, compared to 85.3 percent in the third quarter of 2009.  The lower benefit ratio resulted from a higher rate of claim recoveries and a stable level of claim incidence rates for group long-term disability. Premium income in group disability declined 4.4 percent to $513.6 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $537.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. On-going price competition, along with challenging economic conditions which negativ ely impact employment levels and wage growth, and the Companys continued commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection were contributing factors to the decline in premium income. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the third quarter of 2010 increased 1.9 percent to $21.1 million, compared to $20.7 million in the third quarter of 2009. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products decreased 16.7 percent to $11.5 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $13.8 million in the third quarter of 2009.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 90.2 percent through the first three quarters of 2010, compared to 87.3 percent through the first three quarters of 2009. Case persistency for this line was 88.4 percent through the first three quarters of 2010, compared to 87.2 percent through the first three quarters of 2009. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 89.1 per cent through the first three quarters of 2010, compared to 88.5 percent through the first three quarters of 2009. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 87.2 percent through the first three quarters of 2010, compared to 86.2 percent through the first three quarters of 2009.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 5.6 percent increase in operating income to $52.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $50.0 million in the third quarter of 2009. Premium income for this line of business increased 2.2 percent to $300.0 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $293.4 million in the third quarter of 2009, reflecting favorable persistency.  The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2010 was 70.4 percent compared to 70.3 percent in the third quarter of 2009, reflecting consistent risk experience in this line of business.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products declined 12.3 percent in the third quarter of 2010 to $27.1 million from $30.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. Premium persistency in the gr oup life line of business was 91.8 percent through the first three quarters of 2010, compared to 86.8 percent through the first three quarters of 2009. Case persistency in the group life line of business through the first three quarters of 2010 was 88.3 percent compared to 86.9 percent through the first three quarters of 2009.

The Unum US supplemental and voluntary line of business reported a 2.8 percent increase in operating income to $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $72.1 million in the third quarter of 2009.  The increase is attributable to higher income in the voluntary benefits line of business.  Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 3.3 percent to $397.0 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $384.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.  Relative to the third quarter of 2009, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 26.8 percent in the third quarter of 2010, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line decreased 4.9 percent, and group long-term care sales increased 72.7 percent.
 
Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $47.2 million in the third quarter of 2010, a decrease of 19.6 percent from $58.7 million in the third quarter of 2009.  In local currency, operating income for the third quarter of 2010 decreased 15.1 percent, to 30.4 million from 35.8 million in the third quarter of 2009.
 
The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2010 was 66.9 percent, compared to 50.2 percent in the comparable quarter in 2009. The unusually low benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2009 resulted from the impact of lower inflation on claim reserves associated with inflation index-linked group policies as compared to higher inflation in the third quarter of 2010.  The higher benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2010 also reflects a lower rate of claim resolutions in the group disability product line when compared to the third quarter of 2009, which was partially offset by slightly favorable risk results for the group life line.  Premium income decreased 4.9 percent to $161.4 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $169.7 million in the third quarter of 2009.  In local currency, premium income incr eased 0.7 percent to 104.1 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to 103.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 91.1 percent through the first three quarters of 2010, compared to 87.7 percent through the first three quarters of 2009. Persistency in the group life line of business was 92.5 percent through the first three quarters of 2010, compared to 78.2 percent through the first three quarters of 2009. Sales decreased 7.8 percent to $29.6 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $32.1 million in the third quarter of 2009.  In local currency, sales for the third quarter of 2010 decreased 2.6 percent to 19.1 million, compared to 19.6 million in the third quarter of 2009.

Colonial Life Segment
 
 
Colonial Life reported a 5.8 percent increase in operating income to $74.5 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $70.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.  The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2010 was 49.9 percent, compared to 48.2 percent for the same period in 2009.  The benefit ratio increase resulted from a higher benefit ratio in the accident, sickness, and disability line which was partially offset by lower benefit ratios in both the cancer and critical illness line of business and the life line of business.  Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the third quarter of 2010 was lower relative to the third quarter of 2009 due to updates of estimated gross profits for certain interest-sensitive policies.  Premium income for the third quarter of 2010 increased 6.2 per cent to $269.3 million, compared to $253.5 million in the third quarter of 2009.  Sales increased 2.3 percent to $80.3 million in the third quarter of 2010 from $78.5 million in the third quarter of 2009, driven by strong sales in the commercial market which offset a decline in sales in the public sector market.  New accounts increased 10.2 percent in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009, and average weekly producers increased 7.4 percent compared to the third quarter of 2009.

Individual Disability  Closed Block Segment
 
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $9.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to a lower level of expenses.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 85.5 percent in the third quarter of 2010, compared to 81.6 percent in the third quarter of 2009.  Premium income declined 5.9 percent to $208.5 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $221.5 million in the third quarter of 2009 due to the expected run-off of this block.
 
Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $10.8 million in the third quarter 2010, compared to $13.7 million in the third quarter of 2009.  Higher net investment income and lower operating expense in this years third quarter were partially offset by increased interest expense, reflecting the debt issuances from September of 2010 and 2009.

Shares Outstanding

Shares outstanding totaled 317,790.0 at September 30, 2010.  During the third quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares at a total cost of $197.7 million.

Book Value
 
Book value per common share as of September 30, 2010 was $28.08 compared to $24.86 at September 30, 2009.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The Company anticipates after-tax operating income growth for full year 2010 to be at the lower end of its previously stated outlook of a range of four percent to six percent.  Including share repurchases, the Company expects after-tax operating income per share growth to be at the higher end of that target range.
 
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which may be recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt as well as unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluc tuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure.  For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.  We also believ e that the exclusion of certain other items specified and presented in the reconciliations on the segment financial results pages throughout this supplement enhances the understanding and comparability of our Companys performance and the underlying fundamentals in our operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
2010 Significant Transactions and Events
Share Repurchase Program
In May 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of Unum Groups common stock during a one-year period.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, we repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares for $197.7 million and 15.2 million shares for $327.5 million, respectively, including commissions of $0.2 million and $0.3 million.  The shares of stock repurchased are classified as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.
Financing
In September 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2020, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.625% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we made principal payments of $45.2 million and $7.5 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC and Tailwind Holdings, LLC, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.
Tax Law Change
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future

postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted.  Our income tax expense for the first nine months of 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change.
 
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
During 2009, we made principal payments of $48.0 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028 and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Accounting Developments
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009.  This adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The measure of impairment remains fair value.  Under the standard, an other-than-temporary
impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  In January 2008, we repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay was to be settled, at our option, in either cash or common stock.  The final settlement occurred during the second quarter of 2008, and in total, we repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock under this agreemen t. 
During August 2008, we repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares for $350.0 million, using an accelerated share repurchase agreement with terms similar to the earlier agreement.

2007 Significant Transactions and Events
Revised Claim Reassessment Reserve Estimate
In the second quarter of 2007, we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process $53.0 million before tax and $34.5 million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim.  The claim reassessment process was implemented as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in 2004 and 2005.

ASC 740 Income Taxes
In June 2006, the FASB issued an interpretation to provide authoritative accounting guidance, now included in ASC 740, for income tax positions.  This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Additionally, this interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007.  The cumulative effect of adopting this interpretation, effective January 1, 2007, increased our 2007 opening balanc e of retained earnings $22.7 million.
