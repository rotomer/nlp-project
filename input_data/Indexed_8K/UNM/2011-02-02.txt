(February 2, 2011)
 
Included in the results for the fourth quarter of 2010 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $17.2 million ($0.05 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after-tax investment losses of $18.9 million ($0.06 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net realized after-tax investment gains for the fourth quarter of 2010 include an after-tax gain of $16.1 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $22.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the fourth quarter of 2010 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $1.1 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to net after-tax losses of $41.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.

We are generally pleased with our fourth quarter results, and although not all of our businesses met our expectations, we again benefited from our diverse business portfolio, said Thomas R.

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Unum US Segment
 
           Unum US reported operating income of $206.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 1.5 percent from $203.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Premium income for the segment increased 0.3 percent to $1,211.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010; premium income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1,207.9 million.
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $77.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to operating income of $72.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The 6.1 percent increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher net investment income and an improvement in the benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2010 to 84.2 percent, compared to 84.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The lower benefit ratio resulted from a favorable rate of claim recoveries for group long-term disability, partially offset by a higher level of claim incidence rates for both group long-term and short-term disability. Premium income in group disability declined 4.0 percent to $514.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $535.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Ongoing price competition, along with challenging economic conditions which negatively impact employment levels and wage growth, and the Companys continued commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection were contributing factors to the decline in premium income. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased 10.7 percent to $67.3 million, compared to $75.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products increased 7.5 percent to $37.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $34.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 89.4 percent for full-year 2010, compared to 86.9 percent for full-year 2009. Case persistency for this line was 88.4 percent for full-year 2010, compared to 87.4 percent for full-year 2009. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 88.6 percent for full-year 2010, compared to 86.8 percent for full-year 2009. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 87.3 percent for full-year 2010, compared to 86.5 percent for full-year 2009.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported an 11.5 percent increase in operating income to $53.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $47.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Premium income for this line of business increased 4.6 percent to $302.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $289.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting favorable persistency.  The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 70.3 percent, compared to 69.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting slightly elevated mortality in this line of business.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products increased 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $85.9 million from $84.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 91.5 percent for full-year 2010, compared to 86.9 percent for full-year 2009. Case persistency in the group life line of business for full-year 2010 was 88.3 percent compared to 87.2 percent for full-year 2009.

The Unum US supplemental and voluntary line of business reported an 8.2 percent decline in operating income to $75.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $82.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The decline is primarily attributable to increased active life reserves in long-term care and an acceleration of amortization resulting from lower persistency for certain issue years in certain of the product lines.  Premium income for supplemental and voluntary lines increased 3.1 percent to $394.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $382.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Relative to the fourth quarter of 2009, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, sales in the individual disability  recently issued line decreased 7.4 percent, and group long-term care sales increased 31.9 percent.
 
Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $48.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of 21.5 percent from $61.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  In local currency, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased 18.9 percent, to 30.5 million from 37.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 71.7 percent, compared to 59.6 percent in the comparable quarter in 2009. The higher benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted from less favorable claim experience as well as from the impact of higher inflation on claim reserves associated with inflation index-linked group policies as compared to lower inflation in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The increase in inflation increased net investment income due to a higher return on index-linked bonds, partially offsetting the increase in claim reserves.  Premium income decreased 5.3 percent to $170.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $180.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  In local currency, premium income decreased 2.1 percent to 107.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to 110.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 91.3 percent for full-year 2010, compared to 88.5 percent for full-year 2009. Persistency in the group life line of business was 92.7 percent for full-year 2010, compared to 80.1 percent for full-year 2009. Sales decreased 22.4 percent to $32.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $42.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  In local currency, sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased 19.5 percent to 20.7 million, compared to 25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 were favorably impacted by the exit of another large insurance provider from the U.K. group risk market.

Colonial Life Segment
 
Colonial Life reported an 11.0 percent decrease in operating income to $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $68.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 53.4 percent, compared to 48.5 percent for the same period in 2009.  The benefit ratio increase resulted from a higher benefit ratio in the accident, sickness, and disability line which reflected an increase in the estimate of incurral trends resulting primarily from higher utilization.  Premium income for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 6.3 percent to $273.6 million, compared to $257.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Sales increased 1.3 percent to $121.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 from $119.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by strong sales in the commercial market which offset a decline in sales in the public sector market.  New accounts increased 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, and average weekly producers increased 6.2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Individual Disability  Closed Block Segment
 
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to a lower level of expenses.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 84.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to 81.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Premium income declined 3.4 percent to $212.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $219.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to the expected run-off of this block.

Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Higher net investment income and lower operating expense in this years fourth quarter were partially offset by increased interest expense, reflecting the debt issuance from September 2010.

Capital Management
 
At December 31, 2010, the weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional US insurance companies was approximately 398 percent; leverage was 22.8 percent; and cash and marketable securities in our holding companies equaled $1.2 billion.
 
Leverage is measured as total debt to total capital, which the Company defines as total long-term and short-term debt plus stockholders equity, excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges.  Leverage also excludes the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings, LLC and Northwind Holdings, LLC.
 
Book Value
 
Book value per common share as of December 31, 2010 was $28.25 compared to $25.62 at December 31, 2009.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The Company continues to anticipate growth in after-tax operating income per share for full year 2011 to be in the range of six percent to twelve percent, including the effect of expected share repurchases.
 
 
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which may be recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt of Northwind and Tailwind as well as unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure.  For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Notes to Statistical Supplement
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business. We believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.
 
2010 Significant Transactions and Events
Share Repurchase Program
InMay 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of Unum Groups common stock. The share repurchase program has an expiration date of May 2011. During 2010, we repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a cost of $356.0 million, including commissions of $0.3 million, under this share repurchase program. The dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this program was $144.3 million at December 31, 2010. Stock repurchases are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets.
Financing
In 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2020, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.625% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.  In addition, these notes are effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries.    
During 2010, we made principal payments of $58.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC and Tailwind Holdings, LLC, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.
Tax Law Change
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription
drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax

deductible after 2012. Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted. Our income tax expense for 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change.
 
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
 
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
During 2009, we made principal payments of $48.0 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028 and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008.
Accounting Developments
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009.  This adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The measure of impairment remains fair value.  Under the standard, an other-than-temporaryimpairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

2008 Significant Transactions and Events
Stock Repurchase Agreement

Financing
During 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes due May 2009 and $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes due May 2008.  We made principal payments of $59.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings and Tailwind Holdings, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.
