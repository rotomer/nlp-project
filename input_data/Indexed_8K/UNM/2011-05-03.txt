(May 3, 2011)
 
Included in the results for the first quarter of 2011 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $9.7 million ($0.03 per diluted common share), compared to net realized after-tax investment gains of $16.5 million ($0.05 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2010.  Also included in the results for the first quarter of 2010 is a tax charge of $10.2 million ($0.03 per diluted common share) related to the change in tax treatment of the Medicare subsidy for retiree health benefit plans.  Net realized after-tax investment gains for the first quarter of 2011 include an after-tax gain of $9.1 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the first quarter of 2011 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $0.6 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to net realized after-tax gains of $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $215.7 million ($0.69 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $223.5 million ($0.67 per diluted common share) in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Our first quarter results were generally in line with our expectations and represent a solid start to 2011, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer.  While the current environment still remains challenging, our disciplined approach to the business is serving us well, enabling us to continue to generate excess capital which gives us significant financial flexibility.

RESULTS BY SEGMENT
 
In the following discussions of the Companys operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses.  Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
 
Unum US Segment
 
           Unum US reported operating income of $209.1 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 5.0 percent from $199.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. Premium income for the segment increased 0.3 percent to $1,219.4 million in the first quarter of 2011; premium income in the first quarter of 2010 was $1,216.1 million.
 
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $73.5 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to operating income of $75.8 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The 3.0 percent decrease in operating income was driven by a decline in both premium and net investment income, the effects of which were partially offset by an improvement in the benefit ratio for the first quarter of 2011 to 83.9 percent, compared to 84.2 percent in the first quarter of 2010.  The lower benefit ratio resulted from a favorable rate of claim recoveries for group long-term disability, partially offset by a higher claim incidence rate for group long-term disability, although the claim incidence rate in the first quarter of 2011 was favorable to that of the fourth quarter of 2010.  Premium income in group disability declined 2.6 percent to $508.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $521.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. Ongoing price competition, along with challenging economic conditions which negatively impact employment levels and wage growth, and the Companys continued commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection were contributing factors to the decline in premium income. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the first quarter of 2011 increased 6.9 percent to $29.5 million, compared to $27.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products decreased slightly to $14.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2010.  Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 89.7 percent for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 90.0 percent for the first quarter of 2010. Case persistency for this line was 89.2 percent for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 88.6 percent for the first quarter of 2010. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 90.7 percent for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 89.4 percent for the first quarter of 2010. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 87.7 percent for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 87.6 percent for the first quarter of 2010.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 3.1 percent increase in operating income to $52.8 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. Premium income for this line of business increased 1.5 percent to $300.5 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $296.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, reflecting higher sales, partially offset by lower premium persistency in the large case group life segment.  The benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2011 was 70.0 percent, generally consistent with the 69.7 percent ratio reported for the first quarter of 2010.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products increased 4.1 percent in the first quarter of 2011 to $33.3 million from $32.0 million in the first quarter of 2010. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 86.4 percent for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 92.3 percent for the first quarter of 2010. Case persistency in the group life line of business for the first quarter of 2011, at 88.3 percent, was level with the first quarter of 2010.

The Unum US supplemental and voluntary line of business reported a 14.7 percent increase in operating income to $82.8 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $72.2 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The increase is primarily attributable to higher net investment income, higher premium income, and a favorable benefit ratio in the voluntary benefits product line.  Premium income for the supplemental and voluntary line increased 3.2 percent to $410.9 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $398.2 million in the first quarter of 2010.  Relative to the first quarter of 2010, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 9.6 percent in the first quarter of 2011 to $82.0 million.
 
Unum UK Segment
 
Unum UK reported operating income of $48.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of 19.6 percent from $60.6 million in the first quarter of 2010.  In local currency, operating income for the first quarter of 2011 decreased 21.9 percent, to 30.3 million from 38.8 million in the first quarter of 2010.
 
The benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2011 was 69.3 percent, compared to 63.1 percent in the comparable quarter in 2010. The higher benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2011 resulted from lower premium income, the impact of higher inflation on claim reserves associated with inflation index-linked group policies, and a lower level of claim resolutions in group long-term disability, partially offset by favorable group long-term disability claim incidence.  Premium income increased 0.8 percent to $167.1 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $165.8 million in the first quarter of 2010.  In local currency, premium income decreased 1.8 percent to 104.2 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to 106.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 83.5 percent for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 90.5 percent for the first quarter of 2010. Persistency in the group life line of business was 85.7 percent for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 94.7 percent for the first quarter of 2010. Sales decreased 27.3 percent to $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $24.2 million in the first quarter of 2010.  In local currency, sales for the first quarter of 2011 decreased 28.6 percent to 11.0 million, compared to 15.4 million in the first quarter of 2010.

Colonial Life Segment
 
Colonial Life reported a 5.5 percent decrease in operating income to $69.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $73.0 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The benefit ratio in the first quarter of 2011 was 51.4 percent, compared to 47.1 percent for the same period in 2010.
 
The overall benefit ratio was higher in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 due to less favorable risk results in the accident, sickness, and disability product line and in the life product line.  Accident, sickness, and disability risk results were less favorable due to a higher level of incurred claims.  Risk results for the life line of business were less favorable due to a larger than expected increase in open claims.  Cancer and critical illness risk results were in line with the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to similar levels of incurrals and large claims on the older block of cancer products. Premium income for the first quarter of 2011 increased 5.8 percent to $280.4 million, compared to $265.1 million in the first quarter of 2010.  Sales decreased 3.7 percent to $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2011 from $73.3 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to a decline in new account sales, partially offset by an increase in sales to existing customers.  New accounts decreased 3.6 percent in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010, while average weekly producers increased 2.4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2010.

Individual Disability  Closed Block Segment
 
The Individual Disability  Closed Block segment reported operating income of $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting a decline in both premium income and net investment income due to the expected run-off of this closed block of business.  Premium income declined 5.5 percent to $202.3 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $214.0 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the segment was 84.7 percent in the first quarter of 2011, compared to 84.5 percent in the first quarter of 2010. 
 
Corporate and Other Segment
 
The Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to a loss of $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The decline was driven by higher interest expense, reflecting the debt issuance from September 2010, as well as lower net investment income from private equity partnerships and investments in low-income housing tax credit partnerships.  The negative impact on net investment income from the increased level of investments in low-income housing tax credit partnerships is offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments.

At March 31, 2011, the weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional US insurance companies was approximately 395 percent; leverage was 20.9 percent; and cash and marketable securities in our holding companies equaled $816 million.
 
Leverage is measured as total debt to total capital, which the Company defines as debt plus stockholders equity, excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges.  Leverage also excludes the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings, LLC and Northwind Holdings, LLC.
 
Book Value
 
Book value per common share as of March 31, 2011 was $29.08 compared to $26.38 at March 31, 2010.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The Company continues to anticipate growth in after-tax operating income per share for full year 2011 to be in the range of six percent to twelve percent, including the effect of expected share repurchases.
 
 
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
 
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding certain tax items as well as realized investment gains and losses, which may be recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business.  Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Companys underlying business.  The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt of Northwind and Tailwind as well as unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure.  For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Companys performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income.  We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.  Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Companys underlying business.  We believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.
2011 Significant Transactions and Events
Share Repurchase Program
On February 2, 2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Unum Groups common stock, in addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the May 2010 $500.0 million authorization (see 2010 Significant Transactions and Events on page 15.1 for further discussion of the 2010 authorization).  The $1.0 billion share repurchase program has an expiration date of August 2012.
On February 4, 2011, we repurchased 7.1 million shares, at a cost of $200.0 million, using an accelerated repurchase agreement with a financial counterparty.  As part of this transaction, we simultaneously entered into a forward contract indexed to the price of Unum Group common stock, which subjected the transaction to a future price adjustment.  Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount.  Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of Unum Group common stock.  Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay would have been settled in either cash or common stock.  The final price adjustment settlement occurred on March 18, 2011 resulting in the delivery to us of 0.6 million additional shares.  In total, we repurchased 7.7 million shares pursuant to the accelerated repurchase agreement, which completed the $500.0 million repurchase authorization and initiated the $1.0 billion repurchase program.
In addition to these repurchases, we repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares on the open market at a cost of $23.6 million, for a total repurchase of 8.6 million shares at a cost of $223.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011.  The dollar value of shares remaining under the $1.0 billion repurchase program at March 31, 2011 is $920.7 million.
Pursuant to these repurchase programs, we retired 7.7 million shares during the first three months of 2011.  All other repurchased shares have been classified as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.

Financing
During the first three months of 2011, the remaining $225.1 million of our 7.625% senior notes due March 2011 matured.  We also made principal payments of $21.7 million and $2.5 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind) and Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind), respectively during the three months ended March 31, 2011.
2010 Significant Transactions and Events
Share Repurchase Program
InMay 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  The share repurchase program has an expiration date of May 2011.  During 2010, we repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a cost of $356.0 million, including commissions of $0.3 million, under this share repurchase program.
 
Financing
In 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2020, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.625% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.  In addition, these notes are effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries.    
During 2010, we made principal payments of $58.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind and Tailwind, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.
Tax Law Change
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted.  Our income tax expense for 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009.  This adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments.  The measure of impairment remains fair value.  Under the standard, an other-than-temporaryimpairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009.  The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Stock Repurchase Agreement
During 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Groups common stock.  During 2008, we repurchased $700.0 million or 29.9 million shares of common stock under this share repurchase program. 
Financing
During 2008, we purchased and retired $17.8 million of our outstanding 5.859% notes due May 2009 and $175.0 million of our 5.997% senior notes due May 2008.  We made principal payments of $59.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind and Tailwind, respectively.  We also purchased and retired $36.6 million of our 6.85% senior debentures due 2015.  The costs associated with this debt reduction decreased our 2008 income approximately $0.4 million before tax, or $0.3 million after tax.
