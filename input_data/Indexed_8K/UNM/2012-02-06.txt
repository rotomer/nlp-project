Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 6, 2012, Unum Group (Unum Group or the Company), a Delaware corporation, issued a news release reporting its results for the fourth quarter of 2011, a copy of which is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Also on February 6, 2012, Unum Group posted on its website at

the Statistical Supplement relating to its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011. A copy of the Statistical Supplement is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information included or incorporated in this Item 2.02, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall such information and exhibits be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 2.06    Material Impairments.
On February 3, 2012, the Company concluded that a pre-tax charge of $289.8 million as of December 31, 2011 was appropriate for the impairment of its long-term care deferred acquisition costs. This decision was reached at the conclusion of a comprehensive and strategic review of the Company's long-term care business. As part of the strategic review, the Company analyzed its reserve assumptions for long-term care in conjunction with its annual loss recognition testing of deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves. Included in the analysis was a review of the Company's reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions. The analysis considered the significant decline in long-term interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of 2011 as well as an updated industry study for long-term care experience which was made available mid-year 2011. Based on its analysis, as of December 31, 2011, the Company lowered the discount rate to reflect the lower interest rate environment and the Company's expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates. The Company also changed its mortality and morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging experience and to align more closely with the recently published industry study, which shows a declining trend in death rates and in claim termination rates, both of which increase expectations of the ultimate cost of benefits. Due to the intangible nature of the asset, the Company does not expect to incur any cash expenditures as a result of the impairment.

Unum Group Reports Fourth Quarter 2011 Results
Strong Fourth Quarter Underlying Operating Results
Exiting Long-term Care Business Following Strategic Review
2012 Outlook Maintained
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
(February 6, 2012)
- Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported a net loss of $425.4 million ($1.45 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to net income of $225.8 million ($0.71 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2010, due largely to an after-tax charge of $561.2 million the Company took following its strategic review of the long-term care business and decision to discontinue new group long-term care sales as well as an after-tax reserve charge of $119.3 million in the individual disability closed block.
Adjusting for this charge and other items listed below, operating income on an after-tax basis was $227.6 million ($0.78 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $208.6 million ($0.66 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2010.
I am very pleased with our continued ability to deliver strong underlying operating results, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. We remain focused on growing in our targeted markets and generating solid profitability in our core businesses, while at the same time maintaining a strong balance sheet and capital position. Exiting long-term care further sharpens our focus around businesses consistent with the strategic direction we have set for our Company. Our disciplined approach is working, as even in this difficult environment we achieved solid operating earnings per share growth in 2011 and finished the year with our highest level of risk-based capital.
The Company concluded its strategic review of its long-term care business and announced that it will discontinue new sales of group long-term care contracts during the first quarter of 2012 and reclassify the long-term care line of business from the Unum US segment to the Closed Block segment. The results for the fourth quarter of 2011 include an after-tax charge of $561.2 million ($1.92 per diluted common share) to reflect an increase to long-term care policy and claim reserves of $573.6 million before tax and an impairment of long-term care deferred acquisition costs of $289.8 million before tax.
The decision to discontinue new sales of group long term care policies and move this business to our closed block allows us to further refine our focus on the markets that provide the greatest long-term opportunity for our Company and create maximum value for Unum shareholders, added Watjen. We are well positioned financially to take this action, and this decision does not impact the general financial guidance we have provided for 2012. 
    
The results for the fourth quarter of 2011 also include an increase to claim reserves for the individual disability closed block of business of $183.5 million before tax which resulted in an after-tax decrease to net income of $119.3 million ($0.41 per diluted common share). Please refer to the Other Information section of this release for discussion of the long-term care and individual disability charges.
The results for the fourth quarter of 2011 also include net realized after-tax investment gains of $4.8 million ($0.02 per diluted common share), compared to $17.2 million ($0.05 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net realized after-tax investment gains for the fourth quarter of 2011 include an after-tax loss of $9.8 million resulting from changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance contract, compared to an after-tax gain of $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Also included in net realized after-tax investment gains for the fourth quarter of 2011 are net realized after-tax investment gains of $14.6 million related to sales and write-downs of investments, compared to net after-tax gains of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Additionally, the results for the fourth quarter of 2011 include net tax benefits of $22.7 million ($0.08 per diluted common share) related to an IRS settlement, net of taxes related to subsidiary dividends.
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
In the following discussions of the Company's operating segment results, operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses. Operating income or operating loss excludes income tax and net realized investment gains and losses.
The Company has modified its reporting segments by reclassifying its long-term care line of business from the Unum US segment to the Closed Block segment and reclassifying the other products no longer actively marketed from the Corporate and Other segment to the Closed Block segment. Refer to the Other Information section of this release for further discussion. Prior period segment results have been restated to reflect these reclassifications.
Unum US Segment
    
    Unum US reported operating income of $208.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 7.5 percent from $194.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium income for the segment increased 2.1 percent to $1,083.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011; premium income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1,060.3 million.
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported operating income of $77.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to operating income of $77.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium income in group disability declined 0.6 percent to $511.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $514.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Ongoing price competition in the large case market, along with challenging economic conditions which negatively impact employment levels and wage growth and the Company's continued commitment to disciplined pricing, renewals, and risk selection were contributing factors to the decline in premium income. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 84.7 percent, compared to 84.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting favorable claim incidence and claim recovery rates for group long-term disability which were offset by the decrease in the
    
discount rate for group long-term disability new claim incurrals that was implemented in the third quarter of 2011. Sales of fully insured group long-term disability products in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 11.7 percent to $75.2 million, compared to $67.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales of fully insured group short-term disability products increased 9.1 percent to $40.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $37.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 90.2 percent for full-year 2011, compared to 89.4 percent for full-year 2010. Case persistency for this line was 89.0 percent for full-year 2011, compared to 88.4 percent for full-year 2010. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 89.9 percent for full-year 2011, compared to 88.6 percent for full-year 2010. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 88.0 percent for full-year 2011, compared to 87.3 percent for full-year 2010.
The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 1.3 percent increase in operating income to $53.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $53.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium income for this line of business increased 2.1 percent to $309.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $302.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting higher group life sales. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 70.7 percent, compared to 70.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting slightly elevated mortality rates in this line of business. Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products increased 13.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $97.1 million from $85.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 88.0 percent for full-year 2011, compared to 91.5 percent for full-year 2010. Case persistency in the group life line of business for full-year 2011 was 88.6 percent compared to 88.3 percent for full-year 2010.
The Unum US supplemental and voluntary line of business, which includes the individual disability - recently issued and voluntary benefits lines of business, reported a 21.5 percent increase in operating income to $77.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $63.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium income for the supplemental and voluntary lines increased 8.0 percent to $262.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $243.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The benefit ratio declined to 51.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 54.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, with favorable risk experience in both the voluntary benefits and individual disability - recently issued lines of business. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, and sales in the individual disability - recently issued line increased 33.9 percent.
Unum UK Segment
Unum UK reported operating income of $53.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 11.6 percent from $48.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. In local currency, operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 12.1 percent, to 34.2 million from 30.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
    
Premium income decreased 0.8 percent to $169.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $170.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. In local currency, premium income decreased 0.3 percent to 107.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 107.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 69.1 percent, compared to 71.7 percent in the comparable quarter in 2010. The lower benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulted primarily from favorable mortality experience in the group life line of business and continued progress on implementing the new claim management processes. Sales increased 15.3 percent to $37.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $32.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. In local currency, sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 15.5 percent to 23.9 million, compared to 20.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 86.6 percent for full-year 2011, compared to 91.3 percent for full-year 2010. Persistency in the group life line of business was 89.3 percent for full-year 2011, compared to 92.7 percent for full-year 2010.
Colonial Life Segment
Colonial Life reported an 11.2 percent increase in operating income to $67.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium income for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 5.7 percent to $289.2 million, compared to $273.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.5 percent, compared to 53.4 percent for the same period in 2010. The benefit ratio decline resulted primarily from improved risk experience in the accident, sickness, and disability line. Sales increased 4.2 percent to $126.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $121.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by strong sales in the commercial market which offset a decline in sales in the public sector market. The number of new accounts increased 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and average weekly producers increased 1.6 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Closed Block Segment
The Closed Block segment, which now includes the results of the closed blocks of individual disability, long-term care, and other closed blocks previously reported in the Corporate and Other segment, reported an operating loss of $1,014.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to operating income of $29.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusting for the previously discussed reserve and deferred acquisition cost charges, the Closed Block segment reported operating income of $32.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Premium income for the Closed Block segment declined 4.6 percent to $347.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $363.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the reserve charge, the interest adjusted loss ratio was generally consistent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 for individual disability. For the long-term care line of business, the interest adjusted loss ratio, excluding the reserve charge, was higher in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due
primarily to an increase in active life reserves as a result of continued high persistency levels.
    
Corporate Segment
The Corporate segment, which includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business, reported an operating loss of $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to an operating loss of $23.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
OTHER INFORMATION
Strategic Review of Long-term Care Business
Following a comprehensive and strategic review of the long-term care business, the Company announced that it would discontinue selling group long-term care.  The Company discontinued selling individual long-term care during 2009.  Because both group and individual long-term care are now considered closed blocks of business, effective December 31, 2011, the Company reclassified the long-term care products from the Unum US segment to the Closed Block segment.  It also reclassified the other insurance products not actively marketed, including individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, group pension, health insurance, and individual annuities, which were previously reported in the Corporate and Other segment to the Closed Block segment.  The inclusion of all closed blocks of business into one operating segment aligns with the Company's reporting and monitoring of its closed blocks of business within a discrete segment and is consistent with the separation of these blocks of business from the lines of business which actively market new products. Prior period segment results have been restated to reflect these changes in our reporting classifications.
As part of the strategic review, and as is typical in the fourth quarter of each year, the Company analyzed its reserve assumptions for long-term care in conjunction with the annual loss recognition testing.  The Company generally performs loss recognition tests on its deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year, but more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test.  Included in the analysis was a review of the reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions.  The analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in long-term interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of 2011 due to the European Union debt crisis and the Federal Reserve's actions, including the announcement of "Operation Twist."  The Company also considered an updated industry study for long-term care experience which was made available mid-year 2011 from the Society of Actuaries.  The analysis of this study, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011, showed that lower termination rates than the Company had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in the industry.  Based on this analysis, as of December 31,2011 the Company lowered the discount rate to reflect the low interest rate environment and its expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates.  The Company also changed its mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an improvement in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize long-term care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives long-term care benefits.  The Company changed its morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as its own company experience.  While its morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible, the Company modified its assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study.  Using its revised best estimate assumptions, as of December 31, 2011 the Company
    
determined that its deferred acquisition costs of $289.8 million were not recoverable and that its policy and claim reserves should be increased by $573.6 million to reflect the current estimate of future benefit obligations.
Claim Reserve Increase of Individual Disability Closed Block Business
The Company calculates its claim reserves supporting the individual disability closed block business using assumptions based on actual experience believed to be currently appropriate.  Claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters the Company's view of future expectations. Claim resolution rates, which measure the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile.  The Company's claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is its expectation of the resolution rate expected to be experienced over the life of the block of business.  The Company is now able, with a higher degree of confidence, to assess its experience for older ages in its long duration lifetime claim block as its data has become credible. There is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits, as Unum Group's insurance subsidiaries were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered. These benefits were offered during the 1980s and 1990s, recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing the Company with data to build its claim experience base. Emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for the older age, longer duration disabled claimants, which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits.  As a result of this experience, as of December 31, 2011 the Company adjusted its mortality assumption within its claim resolution rate assumption and, as a result, increased the claim reserves for the individual disability closed block of business by $183.5 million.
Shares Outstanding
The Company's average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution, was 292.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 318.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Shares outstanding totaled 292.7 million at December 31, 2011. During the full year 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 25.4 million shares at a cost of $619.9 million.
Capital Management
At December 31, 2011, the weighted average risk-based capital for the Company's traditional US insurance companies was approximately 405 percent; leverage was 22.4 percent; and cash and marketable securities in the holding companies equaled $756 million.
Leverage is measured as total debt to total capital, which the Company defines as total long-term and short-term debt plus stockholders' equity, excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges. Leverage also excludes the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings, LLC and Northwind Holdings, LLC as well as the short-term debt arising from securities lending agreements.
Book Value
Book value per common share as of December 31, 2011 was $29.30 compared to $28.25 at December 31, 2010.
    
OUTLOOK
The Company continues to anticipate growth in after-tax operating income per share for full year 2012 to be in the range of six percent to twelve percent, including the effect of expected share repurchases of approximately $500 million in 2012. The Company also continues to anticipate that the weighted average risk-based capital for its traditional US insurance companies for year-end 2012 will be within a range of 375 percent to 400 percent, and cash and marketable securities in the holding companies will be within a range of $500 million to $800 million.
As previously reported, the Company will adopt an update to Accounting Standards Codification 944 Financial Services - Insurance effective January 1, 2012. The update addresses diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs. The Company had previously announced that its retrospective adoption of this update would result in a non-cash cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders' equity of between $400 million and $600 million in the year of adoption. As a result of the impairment of the long-term care deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2011, as well as continued refinements in the Company's estimate, the Company now expects that adoption of this standard during the first quarter of 2012 in will result in a cumulative effect decrease in stockholders' equity as of January 1, 2012 of approximately $400 million.
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. The Company believes operating income or loss, excluding realized investment gains and losses, which may be recurring, and excluding certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains and losses are primarily dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding the Company's underlying business.
The exclusion of certain other items specified in the non-GAAP reconciliation also enhances the understanding and comparability of the Company's performance and the underlying fundamentals in its operations, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur.
The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt of Northwind and Tailwind, the short-term debt arising from securities lending agreements, and the unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Unum Group Reserves
The increase in the Closed Block segment policy and claim reserves from December 31, 2010 is due primarily to the 2011 long-term care and individual disability reserve charges (see
Conclusion of Long-term Care Strategic Review
and
Claim Reserve Increase for Individual Disability Closed Block Business
in the "Notes to the Statistical Supplement" on pages 15 and 15.1). Excluding the reserve charge, total reserves for long-term care closed block increased due to normal growth in active life reserves. Excluding the reserve charge, claim reserves for individual disability closed block decreased due to higher claim recoveries partially offset by higher claim incidence rates.

Notes to Statistical Supplement
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Company's performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses, which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and general economic events and are not necessarily related to decisions regarding our Company's underlying business. We believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.
2011 Significant Transactions and Events
Conclusion of Long-term Care Strategic Review
Following a comprehensive and strategic review of our long-term care business, in February 2012 we announced that we would discontinue selling group long-term care.  We discontinued selling individual long-term care during 2009. Because both group and individual long-term care are now considered closed blocks of business, effective December 31, 2011, we reclassified our long-term care products from the Unum US segment to the Closed Block segment.  We also reclassified our other insurance products not actively marketed, including individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, group pension, health insurance, and individual annuities, which were previously reported in the Corporate and Other segment to the Closed Block segment. The inclusion of all closed blocks of business into one operating segment aligns with our reporting and monitoring of our closed blocks of business within a discrete segment and is consistent with our separation of these blocks of business from the lines of business which actively market new products.  Prior period segment results have been restated to reflect these changes in our reporting classifications.
As part of the strategic review, and as is typical in the fourth quarter of each year, we analyzed our reserve assumptions for long-term care in conjunction with our annual loss recognition testing. We generally perform loss recognition tests on our deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year, but more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test. Included in the analysis was a review of our reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions. Our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in long-term interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of 2011 due to the European Union debt crisis and the Federal Reserve's actions, including the announcement of "Operation Twist." We also considered an updated industry study for long-term care experience which was made available mid-year 2011 from the Society of Actuaries. Our analysis of this study, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011, showed that lower termination rates than we had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in industry and in our own company experience. Based on our analysis, as of December 31, 2011 we lowered the discount rate to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates. We also changed our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an improvement in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize long-term care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives long-term care benefits.  We changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience. While our morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible, we modified our assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study. Using our revised best estimate assumptions, as of December 31, 2011 we determined that our deferred acquisition costs of $289.8 million were not recoverable and that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $573.6 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations. These charges decreased our 2011 net income by $561.2 million. The increase in reserves represented a 10.5 percent increase in long-term care policy and claim reserves as of December 31, 2011, which equal $5.4 billion subsequent to the charge. 
Claim Reserve Increase for Individual Disability Closed Block Business
Claim reserves supporting our individual disability closed block of business are calculated using assumptions based on actual experience believed to be currently appropriate. Claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations. Claim resolution rates, which measure
the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business. We are now able, with a higher degree of confidence, to assess our own experience for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block as our data has become credible. There is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits, as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered. These benefits were offered during the 1980s and 1990s, recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing us with data to build our claim experience base. Emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age, longer duration disabled claimants, which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits. As a result of this experience, as of December 31, 2011 we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption and, as a result, increased our claim reserves for our individual disability closed block of business by $183.5 million and decreased net income by $119.3 million. The increase in reserves represented a 1.5 percent increase in individual disability policy and claim reserves as of December 31, 2011, which equal $11.9 billion subsequent to the charge. 
Share Repurchase Program
In February 2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Unum Group's common stock, in addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the May 2010 $500.0 million authorization (See 2010 Significant Transactions and Events on page 15.2 for further discussion of the 2010 authorization). The $1.0 billion share repurchase program has an expiration date of August 2012.
In February 2011, we repurchased 7.1 million shares, at a cost of $200.0 million, using an accelerated repurchase agreement with a financial counterparty. As part of this transaction, we simultaneously entered into a forward contract indexed to the price of Unum Group common stock, which subjected the transaction to a future price adjustment. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount. Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of Unum Group common stock. Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay would have been settled in either cash or common stock at our option. The final price adjustment settlement occurred in March 2011, resulting in the delivery to us of 0.6 million additional shares. In total, we repurchased 7.7 million shares pursuant to the accelerated repurchase agreement, which completed the May 2010 $500.0 million repurchase authorization and initiated the $1.0 billion repurchase program.
In addition to these repurchases, during 2011, we repurchased an additional 17.7 million shares on the open market at a cost of $419.9 million, including commissions of $0.3 million. The dollar value of shares remaining under the $1.0 billion repurchase program at December 31, 2011 was $524.7 million.
Pursuant to these repurchase programs, we retired 7.7 million shares during 2011. All other repurchased shares have been classified as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.
Income Tax
Our income tax for 2011 includes $41.3 million of tax benefits recognized due to a final settlement with the IRS with respect to our appeal of audit adjustments for the tax years 1996 to 2004. Our income tax for 2011 was unfavorably impacted by an $18.6 million tax charge related to the repatriation of 150.0 million of dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries.
The income tax rate in the U.K. is expected to be reduced annually, at least one percent per year, beginning in April 2011, with the ultimate goal of reducing the rate from 28 percent to 23 percent. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities through income on the date of enactment of a rate change, the first of which occurred during the third quarter of 2010. An additional rate change was enacted during the third quarter of 2011. We recorded a reduction of $6.8 million and $2.7 million to our income tax expense during 2011 and 2010, respectively, to reflect the impact of the rate changes on our net deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations.
Financing
During 2011, the remaining $225.1 million of our 7.625% senior notes due March 2011 matured. We also made principal payments of $74.4 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind) and Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind), respectively, during 2011. At December 31, 2011, short-term debt consisted of $312.3 million of securities lending agreements.
Accounting Developments
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 944 Financial Services - Insurance
In October 2010, the FASB issued an update to address the diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs.  The amendments in the update modify the existing guidance and require that only incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract can be capitalized. All other costs are to be expensed as incurred. The amendments in the update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011 and permit retrospective application.
We had previously announced that our retrospective adoption of this update would result in a non-cash cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders' equity of between $400 million and $600 million in the year of adoption. As a result of the impairment of the long-term care deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2011, as well as continued refinements in our estimate, we now expect that adoption of this standard during the first quarter of 2012 will result in a cumulative effect decrease in stockholders' equity as of January 1, 2012 of approximately $400 million.
2010 Significant Transactions and Events
Share Repurchase Program
In
May 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of Unum Group's common stock. During 2010, we repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a cost of $356.0 million under this share repurchase program.
Financing
In 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2020, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.625% and are payable semi-annually.  The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.  In addition, these notes are effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries.    
During 2010, we made principal payments of $58.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind and Tailwind, respectively. We also purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.
Tax Law Change
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted.  Our income tax expense for 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change.
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
During 2009, we made principal payments of $48.0 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind and Tailwind, respectively. We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028 and repaid $58.3 million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2008.
 
Accounting Developments
ASC 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and interpretive releases, which may not be included in their entirety within the Codification, will remain as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  We adopted Codification effective July 1, 2009. This adoption of Codification had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amended the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments. The measure of impairment remains fair value. Under the standard, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
