Unum Group Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
(October 31, 2012)
- Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $230.2 million ($0.83 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $202.0 million ($0.68 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2011.
Included in the results for the third quarter of 2012 is a net after-tax gain of $6.2 million ($0.03 per diluted common share) resulting from the combined impact of net realized investment gains on the Company's investment portfolio and the amortization of prior period actuarial losses on the Company's pension plan. This compares to a net after-tax loss of $21.1 million ($0.07 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2011.
Adjusting for these items, income on an after-tax basis was $224.0 million ($0.80 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $223.1 million ($0.75 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2011.
I continue to be pleased with the overall performance of the Company, especially the premium growth and profitability we are generating in our core U.S. based businesses, our solid investment performance, and our strong capital position, which gives us significant financial flexibility, said Thomas R. Watjen, president and chief executive officer. While our U.K. business is not meeting our expectations and today's low interest rates present challenges, I am confident that the actions we are taking will enable us to continue to deliver solid financial results and consistently return capital to our shareholders.
    
RESULTS BY SEGMENT
In the following segment financial data, "operating revenue" excludes net realized investment gains or losses. "Operating income" or "operating loss" excludes net realized investment gains or losses, non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, and income tax.
Unum US Segment
    
    Unum US reported operating income of $216.3 million in the third quarter of 2012, an increase of 3.4 percent from $209.2 million in the third quarter of 2011. Premium income for the segment increased 3.5 percent to $1,111.9 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to premium income in the third quarter of 2011 of $1,074.4 million.
Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported a 2.5 percent increase in operating income, with $74.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $72.7 million in the third quarter of 2011. Premium income in group disability increased 0.7 percent to $512.5 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $508.9 million in the third quarter of 2011, driven primarily by sales growth and stable premium persistency. The benefit ratio for the third quarter of 2012 was 84.9 percent, compared to 85.5 percent in the third quarter of 2011. Underlying these results were higher claim recoveries for group long-term disability, partially offset by an increase in claim incidence rates as well as a higher average weekly indemnity for group short-term disability in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year period. Also impacting year over year comparisons was a 50 basis point decrease in the claim discount rate during the third quarter of 2012 for group long-term disability new claim incurrals compared to a 25 basis point decrease in the third quarter of 2011. Group long-term disability sales increased 7.3 percent to $23.6 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $22.0 million in the third quarter of 2011. Group short-term disability sales increased 13.7 percent to $14.1 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $12.4 million in the third quarter of 2011. Premium persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 90.7 percent through the first nine months of 2012, compared to 90.1 percent through the first nine months of 2011. Case persistency for this line was 88.3 percent through the first nine months of 2012, compared to 88.7 percent through the first nine months of 2011. Premium persistency in the group short-term disability line of business was 88.5 percent through the first nine months of 2012, compared to 90.2 percent through the first nine months of 2011. Case persistency for the short-term disability line was 88.1 percent through the first nine months of 2012, compared to 87.8 percent through the first nine months of 2011.
The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported a 7.3 percent increase in operating income to $56.1 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $52.3 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase was driven by favorable premium growth and a lower expense ratio, which offset an increase in the benefit ratio. Premium income for this line of business increased 6.9 percent to $326.5 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $305.3 million in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting higher year-to-date sales and favorable premium persistency. The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2012 was 72.3 percent, compared to 70.2 percent in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting a higher average claim size. Sales of
group life and accidental death and dismemberment products decreased 4.0 percent in the third quarter of 2012 to $26.7 million from $27.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Premium persistency in the group life line of business was 91.1 percent through the first nine months of 2012, compared to 87.7 percent through the first nine months of 2011. Case persistency in the group life line of business through the first nine months of 2012, at 88.0 percent, was down slightly from 88.5 percent through the first nine months of 2011.
The supplemental and voluntary line of business reported a 1.8 percent increase in operating income to $85.7 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $84.2 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase was driven by growth in the individual disability - recently issued lines of business and stable results in the voluntary benefits line of business. Premium income for this line of business increased 4.9 percent to $272.9 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $260.2 million in the third quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales in the voluntary benefits line of business. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability - recently issued line of business in the third quarter of 2012 increased slightly to 31.7 percent from 30.7 percent in the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to lower claim recoveries. The benefit ratio for voluntary benefits, at 50.4 percent in the third quarter of 2012, was essentially unchanged from 50.3 percent in the third quarter of 2011. Sales in the individual disability - recently issued line of business increased 13.2 percent in the third quarter of 2012 to $14.6 million. Relative to the third quarter of 2011, sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2012 to $43.8 million.
Unum UK Segment
Unum UK reported operating income of $27.5 million in the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of 20.7 percent from $34.7 million in the third quarter of 2011. In local currency, operating income for the third quarter of 2012 decreased 19.5 percent, to 17.3 million from 21.5 million in the third quarter of 2011.
Premium income declined 0.2 percent to $175.2 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $175.5 million in the third quarter of 2011. In local currency, premium income increased 1.6 percent to 110.8 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 109.1 million in the third quarter of 2011. The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2012 was 77.7 percent, compared to 78.8 percent in the comparable quarter in 2011. The lower benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2012 reflects favorable risk experience in the group disability line of business, partially offset by unfavorable group life risk experience. The favorable risk experience in group disability resulted from improved claim recoveries and incidence levels. The unfavorable risk experience in group life resulted from a higher average claim size and higher claim volumes in the third quarter of 2012 relative to the third quarter of 2011.
Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 82.9 percent through the first nine months of 2012, compared to 87.1 percent through the first nine months of 2011. Persistency in the group life line of business was 80.3 percent through the first nine months of 2012, compared to 88.7 percent through the first nine months of 2011. Sales decreased 20.2 percent to $17.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $21.3 million in the third quarter of 2011. In local currency, sales for the third quarter of 2012 decreased 19.5
percent to 10.7 million, compared to 13.3 million in the third quarter of 2011 as lower group life sales more than offset an increase in sales in the group long-term disability line of business.
Colonial Life Segment
Colonial Life reported a 3.0 percent increase in operating income to $68.7 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $66.7 million in the third quarter of 2011, as an increase in premium income more than offset the impact of a slightly higher benefit ratio in the quarter.
Premium income for the third quarter of 2012 increased 5.5 percent to $299.4 million, compared to $283.7 million in the third quarter of 2011. The benefit ratio in the third quarter of 2012 was 52.9 percent, compared to 52.6 percent for the same period in 2011, as higher mortality in the life line of business more than offset favorable experience in the cancer and critical illness and accident, sickness, and disability lines of business.
Sales decreased 5.8 percent to $78.4 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $83.2 million in the third quarter of 2011, driven primarily by a decline in new account sales. Commercial market sales in the third quarter of 2012 were lower than the same period of 2011, driven primarily by a decline in sales to the large case commercial market, which we define as accounts with more than 1,000 lives. Sales in the public sector were also lower in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the same period of 2011. The number of new accounts decreased 8.2 percent in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011.
Closed Block Segment
The Closed Block segment reported operating income of $25.6 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $30.8 million in the third quarter of 2011, driven by a decline in income in the long-term care line of business, partially offset by higher income from the individual disability line of business.
Premium income for the individual disability line of business declined 6.8 percent in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the comparable year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the expected run-off of this block of business. The interest adjusted loss ratio for this line of business was 82.5 percent in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 84.9 percent in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting higher claim recovery rates. 
Premium income for the long-term care line of business increased 4.8 percent to $159.4 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $152.1 million in the third quarter of 2011, driven by continued high premium persistency, issuances of group long-term care policies, and the implementation of rate increases on certain of our individual long-term care policies. While the Company announced in the first quarter of 2012 that it would discontinue sales of new long-term care business, there were several group cases which were already in the quoting and/or underwriting process for which policies have now been issued. The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care increased to 91.3 percent in the third quarter of 2012 from 86.0 percent in the third quarter of 2011, due to higher claim incidence rates and higher average new claim size.
Corporate Segment
The Corporate segment reported an operating loss of $27.4 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to a loss of $20.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. The higher operating loss in the third quarter of 2012 was driven primarily by lower net investment income and slightly higher interest expense due to the issuance of $250 million of debt during the third quarter of 2012. Net investment income was lower in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011 due to lower asset levels, a lower proportion of assets invested at long-term interest rates, and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax-credit partnerships. However, the negative impact on net investment income from the tax-credit partnerships was offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments.
OTHER INFORMATION
Shares Outstanding
The Company's average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution, was 278.5 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to 299.2 million for the third quarter of 2011. Shares outstanding totaled 275.1 million at September 30, 2012. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares at a cost of $100.2 million.
Share Repurchase Authorization
During the third quarter of 2012, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a $750 million share repurchase program with an expiration date of January 2014. This new authorization supersedes and replaces the previous authorization for $1 billion that was scheduled to expire in August 2012.
Tax Rate
During the third quarters of 2012 and 2011, an income tax reduction was enacted which reduced the tax rates in the U.K.  The Company adjusted its deferred tax assets and liabilities through income on the date of the enactment of the rate changes and recorded a reduction to income tax expense of $9.3 million in third quarter of 2012 and $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2011.
Capital Management
At September 30, 2012, the weighted average risk-based capital for the Company's traditional US insurance companies was approximately 407 percent; leverage was 25.2 percent; and cash and marketable securities in the holding companies equaled $762 million.
Leverage is measured as total debt to total capital, which the Company defines as debt plus stockholders' equity, excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges. Leverage also excludes the non-recourse debt and associated capital of Tailwind Holdings, LLC and Northwind Holdings, LLC and the short-term debt arising from securities lending agreements.
Book Value
Book value per common share as of September 30, 2012 was $31.53, compared to $30.77 at September 30, 2011.
Outlook
The Company anticipates growth in after-tax operating income per share for full year 2012 to be in the range of three percent to six percent, including the effect of expected share repurchases.
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
The Company analyzes its performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes operating income or loss which excludes the specified items listed in its reconciliation is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in its business. Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of the Company's segments. The Company's investment focus is on investment income to support its insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although the Company may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since the Company's underlying business is long-term in nature, and the Company needs to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating its liabilities. Certain components of the net periodic benefit cost for the Company's pensions and other postretirement benefit plans, namely the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, are primarily driven by market performance and are not indicative of the operational results of the Company's businesses. The Company believes that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses from operating income by segment provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of operating results. However, although the Company manages its non-operating retirement-related gains or losses separately from the operational performance of its business, these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of the Company and will increase or decrease over time, depending on market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in the Company's pensions and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company believes leverage excluding the non-recourse debt of Northwind and Tailwind, the short-term debt arising from securities lending agreements, and the unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges, which also tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, is an important measure. For reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, refer to the attached digest of earnings.

Unum Group Financial Highlights
Effective January 1, 2012 we adopted an accounting standards update regarding the capitalization of costs associated with the acquisition of insurance contracts (ASU 2010-26) and applied the amendments retrospectively, adjusting all prior period information presented in this statistical supplement, as applicable.
Our reporting segments are comprised of Unum US, Unum UK, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate. Effective with the fourth quarter of 2011 we modified our reporting segments to reclassify our long-term care products from the Unum US segment to the Closed Block segment.  We also reclassified our other insurance products not actively marketed which were previously reported in the Corporate and Other segment to the Closed Block segment. Also, we previously allocated the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, a component of the net periodic benefit costs for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans, to our Corporate segment. During the first quarter of 2012, we determined that we would modify our segment reporting, effective January 1, 2012, to exclude the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses from operating income or operating loss by segment. Prior period segment results have been adjusted to conform to these changes.

Notes to Statistical Supplement
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We analyze our Company's performance using non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items and the related tax thereon from net income. We believe operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains or losses and non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, both of which are recurring, is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. Both realized investment gains or losses and non-operating retirement-related gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our Company. The exclusion of these items from our performance does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability. We also believe book value per common share excluding the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, certain of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends, are important measures.
2012 Significant Transactions and Events
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 944 "Financial Services - Insurance
In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to address the diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs.  The amendments in the update require that only incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract can be capitalized. All other costs are to be expensed as incurred. We adopted this update effective January 1, 2012 and applied the amendments retrospectively, adjusting all prior periods.
Financing
In August 2012, we issued
$250.0 million
of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due in 2042, bear interest at a fixed rate of
5.75%
and are payable semi-annually. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. We also made principal payments of $38.1 million and $7.5 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind) and Tailwind Holdings, LLC (Tailwind), respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. At September 30, 2012, short-term debt consisted of $458.3 million of securities lending transactions.
Share Repurchase Program
In July 2012, our board of directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program with an expiration date of January 2014. This program superseded and replaced the February 2011 $1.0 billion share repurchase program. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2012, we repurchased 5.1 million and 18.6 million shares on the open market at a cost of $100.2 million and $400.5 million, respectively, including commissions of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The dollar value of shares remaining under the $750.0 million repurchase program was approximately $650.0 million at September 30, 2012.
2011 Significant Transactions and Events
Conclusion of Long-term Care Strategic Review
Following a comprehensive and strategic review of our long-term care business, in February 2012 we announced that we would discontinue selling group long-term care.  We discontinued selling individual long-term care during 2009. Because both group and individual long-term care are now considered closed blocks of business, effective
December 31, 2011, we reclassified our long-term care products from the Unum US segment to the Closed Block segment.  We also reclassified our other insurance
products not actively marketed, including individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, group pension, health insurance, and individual annuities, which were previously reported in the Corporate and Other segment to the Closed Block segment. The inclusion of all closed blocks of business into one operating segment aligns with our reporting and monitoring of our closed blocks of business within a discrete segment and is consistent with our separation of these blocks of business from the lines of business which actively market new products.  Prior period segment results have been restated to reflect these changes in our reporting classifications.
As part of the strategic review, and as is typical in the fourth quarter of each year, we analyzed our reserve assumptions for long-term care in conjunction with our annual loss recognition testing. We generally perform loss recognition tests on our deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year, but more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test. Included in the analysis was a review of our reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions. Our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in long-term interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of 2011 due to the European Union debt crisis and the Federal Reserve's actions, including the announcement of "Operation Twist." We also considered an updated industry study for long-term care experience which was made available mid-year 2011 from the Society of Actuaries. Our analysis of this study, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011, showed that lower termination rates than we had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in industry and in our own company experience. Based on our analysis, as of December 31, 2011 we lowered the discount rate to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates. We also changed our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an improvement in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize long-term care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives long-term care benefits.  We changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience. While our morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible, we modified our assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study. Using our revised best estimate assumptions, as of December 31, 2011 we determined that our deferred acquisition costs of $196.0 million were not recoverable and that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $573.6 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations. These charges decreased our 2011 net income by $500.3 million. The increase in reserves represented a 10.5 percent increase in long-term care policy and claim reserves as of December 31, 2011, which equaled $5.4 billion subsequent to the charge. 
Claim Reserve Increase for Individual Disability Closed Block Business
Claim reserves supporting our individual disability closed block of business are calculated using assumptions based on actual experience believed to be currently appropriate. Claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations. Claim resolution rates, which measure the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business. We are now able, with a higher degree of confidence, to assess our own experience for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block as our data has become credible. There is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits, as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered. These benefits were offered during the 1980s and 1990s, recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing us with data to build our claim experience base. Emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age, longer duration disabled claimants, which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits. As a result of this experience, as of December 31, 2011 we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption and, as a result, increased our claim reserves for our individual disability closed block of business by $183.5 million and decreased net income by $119.3 million. The increase in reserves represented a 1.5 percent increase in individual disability policy and claim reserves as of December 31, 2011, which equaled $11.9 billion subsequent to the charge. 
Share Repurchase Program
In February 2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Unum Group's common stock, in addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the May 2010 $500.0 million authorization. The $1.0 billion share repurchase program had an expiration date of August 2012.
In February 2011, we repurchased 7.1 million shares, at a cost of $200.0 million, using an accelerated repurchase agreement with a financial counterparty. As part of this transaction, we simultaneously entered into a forward contract indexed to the price of Unum Group common stock, which subjected the transaction to a future price adjustment. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount. Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of Unum Group common stock. Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay would have been settled in either cash or common stock at our option. The final price adjustment settlement occurred in March 2011, resulting in the delivery to us of 0.6 million additional shares. In total, we repurchased and retired 7.7 million shares pursuant to the accelerated repurchase agreement, which completed the May 2010 $500.0 million repurchase authorization and initiated the $1.0 billion repurchase program.
In addition to these repurchases, during 2011, we repurchased an additional 17.7 million shares on the open market at a cost of $419.9 million, including commissions of $0.3 million. The dollar value of shares remaining under the $1.0 billion repurchase program at December 31, 2011 was $524.7 million.
Pursuant to these repurchase programs, we retired 7.7 million shares during 2011. All other repurchased shares are classified as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.
Income Tax
Our income tax for 2011 includes $41.3 million of tax benefits recognized due to a final settlement with the IRS with respect to our appeal of audit adjustments for the tax years 1996 to 2004. Our income tax for 2011 was unfavorably impacted by an $18.6 million tax charge related to the repatriation of 150.0 million of dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries.
Financing
During 2011, the remaining $225.1 million of our 7.625% senior notes due March 2011 matured. We also made principal payments of $74.4 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind and Tailwind, respectively, during 2011. At December 31, 2011, short-term debt consisted of $312.3 million of securities lending agreements.
2010 Significant Transactions and Events
Share Repurchase Program
In
May 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of Unum Group's common stock. During 2010, we repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a cost of $356.0 million under this share repurchase program.
Financing
In 2010, we issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering.  These notes, due in 2020, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.625% and are payable semi-annually.
During 2010, we made principal payments of $58.3 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse floating rate notes issued by Northwind and Tailwind, respectively. We also purchased and retired $10.0 million of our 7.08% medium-term notes due 2024.
Tax Law Change
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Among other things, the new legislation reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Under the new legislation, to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program, the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Employers that receive the subsidy must recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted.  Our income tax expense for 2010 includes a non-cash tax charge of $10.2 million to reflect the impact of the tax law change.
2009 Significant Transactions and Events
Financing
In September 2009, we issued $350.0 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering. These notes, due in 2016, bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.125% and are payable semi-annually.
During 2009, we made principal payments of $48.0 million and $10.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse variable rate notes issued by Northwind and Tailwind, respectively. We also purchased and retired the remaining $132.2 million of our 5.859% senior notes due May 2009, $1.2 million aggregate principal of our 7.19% medium-term notes due 2028, and $0.6 million aggregate principal of our 6.75% notes due 2028.
ASC 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities
In April 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, now included in ASC 320, which amended the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands and increases the frequency of previously existing disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments. The measure of impairment remains fair value. Under the standard, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2009. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this standard increased the April 1, 2009 opening balance of retained earnings $14.3 million, net of tax of $7.7 million, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
