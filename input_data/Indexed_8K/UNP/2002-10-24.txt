EXHIBIT 99 RECORD QUARTER FOR UNION PACIFIC FOURTH STRAIGHT QUARTER OF DOUBLE-DIGIT EPS GROWTH FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: OMAHA, NE, OCTOBER 24 - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) today reported an all-time record net income for the third quarter of $437 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. This is compared to net income of $267 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001. Third quarter results included income gains from a transaction with the Utah Transit Authority, as well as a tax settlement. Excluding these items, quarterly earnings were $1.19 per diluted share - a 14 percent increase over third quarter 2001. "Union Pacific combined record revenues with all-time productivity levels to produce great results," said Dick Davidson, chairman and chief executive officer. "We achieved double-digit growth in earnings per share for the fourth straight quarter. This trend is further proof that our business strategy is on target." THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS For the third quarter, Union Pacific Corporation, excluding Overnite, reported record operating income of $619 million compared to $556 million for the same period in 2001. o All-time quarterly records were: o Operating Revenue - $2.85 billion o Commodity Revenue - $2.73 billion -more-

"We have been facing some challenges in the wake of the port disruption," said Davidson. "Fortunately, our strong rail franchise gives us the revenue diversity and network flexibility to rebound rapidly. We remain focused on reducing costs and improving service as we work to meet Union Pacific's commitment to our customers and shareholders."
