EXHIBIT 99 RECORD QUARTER, RECORD YEAR FOR UNION PACIFIC FOURTH STRAIGHT YEAR OF EARNINGS IMPROVEMENT OMAHA, NE, JANUARY 22, 2003 - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) today reported a fourth quarter record net income of $378 million, or $1.41 per diluted share. This is a 37 percent increase over the 2001 level of $275 million, or $1.06 per diluted share. The 2002 quarterly results include one-time gains of $0.16 per diluted share from the sale of land and track to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority as well as $0.15 per diluted share for tax adjustments. Without these transactions, the Corporation earned $1.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002. For the year, net income increased by 39 percent to a record $1.341 billion, or $5.05 per diluted share, compared to $966 million, or $3.77 per diluted share in 2001. Excluding one-time items totaling $0.75 per diluted share that Union Pacific reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2002, full year earnings were $4.30 per diluted share, a 14 percent increase over 2001 earnings. "This was a remarkable year for Union Pacific," Dick Davidson, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "While it was a very difficult economic environment, and the West Coast port disruption temporarily slowed our momentum, the men and women of Union Pacific answered every challenge. "Our 2002 earnings performance accelerated our ability to strengthen the balance sheet and position ourselves for continued long-term growth." -m o r e-

The operating ratio was 94.7 percent in 2002, compared to 95.0 in 2001. 2003 OUTLOOK "The outlook for our core business remains strong," said Davidson. "We would expect moderately improved revenue growth throughout the year, but we're concerned about the potential impact of an uncertain economy and high energy prices." Union Pacific Corporation is one of America's leading transportation companies. Its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad, is the largest railroad in North America, covering 23 states across the western two-thirds of the United States. A strong focus on quality and a strategically advantageous route structure enable the company to serve customers in critical and fast growing markets. It is a leading carrier of low-sulfur coal used in electrical power generation and has broad coverage of the large chemical-producing areas along the Gulf Coast. With competitive long-haul routes between all major West Coast ports and eastern gateways, and as the only railroad to serve all six gateways to Mexico, Union Pacific has the premier rail franchise in North America. The Corporation's trucking operations include Overnite Corporation, which owns less-than-truckload carriers Overnite Transportation and Motor Cargo.
