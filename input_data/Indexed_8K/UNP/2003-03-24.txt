EXHIBIT 99 UNION PACIFIC UPDATES EARNINGS OUTLOOK HIGH FUEL PRICES IMPACTING BUSINESS RESULTS OMAHA, NEB., MARCH 24, 2003 - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) today announced that its first quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the $0.58 to $0.60 range. This compares to $0.86 in the first quarter of 2002 and is lower than the Company's initial target estimate for the quarter. During the quarter, war fears dramatically increased the Company's fuel cost and contributed to a recent softening in economic demand. In addition, winter storms have had an impact on financial results. "Average diesel fuel prices for the quarter are almost $0.40 per gallon more than we paid a year ago. Operating costs for the entire transportation industry have been inflated by fuel prices that reached all-time highs during the quarter," said Dick Davidson, chairman and chief executive officer. "In addition, while first quarter revenues started out fairly strong, as war tensions increased and crude oil prices rose, we saw a weakening in some customer shipments. As a result, we have not experienced the growth we'd expected, particularly in March, which is typically the strongest month of the quarter." 2003 FIRST QUARTER IMPACTS Key factors affecting the quarterly earnings results include: o Rising diesel fuel prices will add approximately $130 million to operating expenses, or costing nearly $0.30 per diluted share from 2002 to 2003. o Coal inventory adjustments at utility plants and the operational impact of a severe March storm will result in lower than expected Energy revenues. o Softening demand toward the end of the quarter has resulted in lower than expected growth in our domestic intermodal and chemicals businesses. -more-
-2- o Severance costs will total $0.04 per diluted share in the quarter. Work force level reductions are on plan, but overall costs are less than anticipated due to higher attrition rates and lower severance payments. Excluding the effects of increased fuel prices and one-time severance payments, Union Pacific Railroad's operating margin will likely match, or be slightly better than last year's rate. FAS 143 In the first quarter, the Company will also report a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that will add approximately $250 to $300 million after tax to Union Pacific's first quarter net income. This change results from the adoption of FAS 143 (Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations). This new standard is being adopted by all rail transportation companies and changes the way the rail industry accounts for track structure removal costs. This change will have no impact on liquidity. 2003 OUTLOOK "It appears that high fuel prices and economic weakness in the first half of the year will challenge the Company's ability to reach our 2003 goal of 5 to 10 percent earnings growth over 2002 core earnings* of $4.30 per diluted share," said Davidson. "In the face of these head winds, however, the men and women of Union Pacific remain dedicated to achieving continued productivity gains, improved service reliability and increased customer satisfaction. "Looking ahead, I'm hopeful that a quick and positive outcome to the war in Iraq will restore consumer confidence, strengthen the economy and continue to drive fuel prices lower, thus helping to drive a strong second half performance for the Company.
