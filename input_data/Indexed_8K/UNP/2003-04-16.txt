EXHIBIT INDEX

UNION PACIFIC CAPITAL TRUST TO REDEEM $500 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OMAHA, NEB., APRIL 16, 2003 - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) today announced that it would exercise its option to redeem $500 million of the $1.5 billion Union Pacific Capital Trust 6 1/4% Convertible Preferred Securities Term Income Deferrable Equity Securities (TIDES) on May 16, 2003. The TIDES redemption is part of Union Pacific's ongoing efforts to strengthen its financial position and increase shareholder value. In addition to improving its balance sheet, Union Pacific will also benefit from reducing its annual interest expense by $31.25 million and decreasing the dilutive effect of the TIDES by 7.3 million shares. The redemption will have an on-going quarterly earnings benefit; however, second quarter earnings in 2003 will be reduced by an estimated $0.03 per diluted share due to the net impact of one-time redemption costs. The net full-year benefit is expected to be approximately $0.04 per diluted share in 2003 and is estimated at $0.12 per diluted share in 2004. The TIDES were originally offered on April 1, 1998 at a price of $50 each. TIDES will be redeemed, as determined by the Trustee, on a pro rata basis at a price of $50.52, which includes a one percent redemption premium. TIDES holders will be receiving official redemption notices with appropriate instructions from the Trustee, The Bank of New York. Holders with questions should contact the Trustee at 212-815-5091.
