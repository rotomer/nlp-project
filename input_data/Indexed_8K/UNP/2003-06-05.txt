EXHIBIT INDEX

UNION PACIFIC CAPITAL TRUST TO REDEEM $500 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: OMAHA, NEB., JUNE 5, 2003 - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) today announced that it would exercise its option to redeem $500 million of the remaining $1.0 billion Union Pacific Capital Trust 6 1/4% Convertible Preferred Securities Term Income Deferrable Equity Securities (TIDES) on July 7, 2003. The TIDES redemption is part of Union Pacific's ongoing efforts to improve free cash flow by leveraging interest rates that are at 40-year lows. The redemption will be financed with the proceeds from the Corporation's recent $500 million debt issuance, which has an average yield of 4.42%. Union Pacific's annual interest savings from this refinancing will be approximately $9 million and the full-year dilutive effect of the TIDES will be reduced by 7.3 million shares. The redemption will have an on-going earnings benefit; however, this benefit will be offset by one-time redemption costs of approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003. The estimated earnings impact of this refinancing will be a reduction of $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter and a fourth quarter addition of $0.02 per diluted share. The full year 2004 benefit is estimated at $0.07 per diluted share. The TIDES were originally offered on April 1, 1998 at a price of $50 each. TIDES will be redeemed at a price of $50.52, which includes a one percent redemption premium, plus accrued interest up to July 7, 2003. TIDES holders will receive appropriate redemption notices with instructions from the Trustee, The Bank of New York. Holders with questions should contact the Trustee at 212-815-5091. -m o r e-
