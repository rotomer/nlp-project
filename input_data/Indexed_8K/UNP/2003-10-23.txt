EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99 RECORD REVENUE FOR UNION PACIFIC STRONG PERFORMANCE IN AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND ENERGY OMAHA, NEB., OCTOBER 23, 2003 - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) today reported net income for the third quarter of $317 million or $1.21 per diluted share. This compares to $437 million or $1.63 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2002, which included income gains from a major real estate sale, as well as a tax settlement. These two items added $0.44 per diluted share to the 2002 quarterly earnings. "As in the first half of the year, fuel prices continued to be a drain on earnings, adding nearly $50 million to third quarter expenses," said Dick Davidson, chairman and chief executive officer. "On the plus side, however, we achieved record revenue of nearly $3 billion - a four percent increase over last year." THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS For the third quarter, Union Pacific Corporation reported operating income from continuing operations of $592 million compared to $619 million for the same period in 2002. o Revenue was a record $3.0 billion - up 4 percent versus 2002 o Operating Margin of 20 percent - down 1.7 points versus 2002, primarily as a result of higher energy costs THIRD QUARTER RAILROAD BUSINESS REVENUE SUMMARY VERSUS 2002 Overall, commodity revenue was up 4 percent with three groups, Agricultural, Industrial Products and Energy all achieving best ever quarterly revenue as follows: -more-
-2- o Agricultural up 10 percent o Industrial Products up 7 percent o Energy up 6 percent o Chemicals and Intermodal were flat o Automotive down 3 percent "Even in the face of some operational challenges, we leveraged Union Pacific's diverse businesses into a solid revenue performance," said Davidson. "This competitive advantage enabled us to see strong demand in three of our six business groups and more than offset weaknesses in finished vehicle and chemical demand." OVERNITE'S THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Due to the pending IPO of Overnite Corporation, the company's results are reported as Discontinued Operations. Overnite reported a 13 percent increase in third quarter operating income of $28.8 million compared to $25.6 million in 2002. Operating revenues increased 8 percent to $384.2 million compared to $354.7 million last year. Overnite's 2003 operating ratio improved 0.3 percentage points to 92.5 percent from 92.8 percent in 2002. YEAR-TO-DATE SUMMARY For the first nine months of 2003, Union Pacific Corporation reported operating income from continuing operations of $1.54 billion compared with $1.69 billion in 2002, down 9 percent. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, rose 7 percent to $1.03 billion versus $963 million for the same period a year ago. The $1.03 billion includes $274 million from the cumulative effect of an accounting change recorded in the first quarter of 2003. -more-
-3- OUTLOOK "We're fairly optimistic that we'll see continued broad-based growth in our business and improving economic conditions as we round out 2003," Davidson said. "While we have been experiencing some operational difficulties in the second half of the year, we expect operations to improve throughout the fourth quarter, enabling Union Pacific to enter 2004 with a balanced, fluid system that is positioned for new growth and new business."
