Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On April 6, 2005, Union Pacific Corporation (the Company) was served with a complaint in a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit, which names as defendants all the current directors and one former director of the Company. The complaint was filed in state court in Salt Lake County, Utah on April 5, 2005. The complaint alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the Company and its shareholders by, among other things, disregarding problems relating to railroad safety, compliance with governmental regulations, including reporting requirements with respect to rail accidents, and the handling of evidence in rail accident cases. The complaint contends that, as a consequence of such alleged breach of duty, the Company suffered substantial monetary losses and other injuries and seeks, among other things, an award of compensatory damages against the defendant directors, other non-monetary remedies and relief, and an award of the plaintiff's reasonable expenses and attorneys fees. The Company will provide updates concerning any material developments in this lawsuit in its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005 and in its periodic reports thereafter in accordance with applicable rules governing disclosure of legal proceedings.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
