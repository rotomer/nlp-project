FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
OMAHA, Neb., July 20, 2006
 
 
 
 
Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) today reported second quarter 2006 net income of $390 million or $1.44 per diluted share, compared to $233 million, or $.88 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Operating income during the second quarter of 2006 was $717 million, up from $468 million reported in the second quarter of 2005.
"Quarterly operating income was the best ever in the history of the railroad," said Jim Young, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Reaching this milestone so early in the year is a clear indication that the demand environment remains very strong, and that we are moving volume more efficiently. The accomplishment I'm most pleased with is that we converted strong demand and yield gains into our best operating ratio in over two years. In addition, customers are seeing our service reliability improve."

"The biggest challenge ahead for us will be to continue to make progress on our operating initiatives, productivity and service reliability in the face of record volume."
