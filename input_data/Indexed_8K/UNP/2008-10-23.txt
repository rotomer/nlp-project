* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. The reclassifications include reporting freight revenues instead of commodity revenues. In addition, we modified our operating expense categories to report fuel used in railroad operations as a stand-alone category, to combine purchased services and materials into one line, and to reclassify certain other expenses among operating expense categories. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported operating revenues, operating expenses, operating income or net income. See Union Pacific Web site under Investor Relations for reclassified 2007, 2006 and 2005 quarterly numbers.
