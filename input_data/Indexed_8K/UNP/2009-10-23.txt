Item 8.01. Other Events.
In media interviews on October 22, 2009, Union Pacific Corporation (the Company) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Young indicated that challenging economic conditions in the year ahead would likely result in close to flat traffic volume in 2010 for Union Pacific Railroad Company, the principal operating subsidiary of the Company. Given the tremendous uncertainty regarding the direction of the economy and the speed of any economic recovery, these statements should not be viewed as the Company's guidance regarding traffic volume for 2010.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: October 23, 2009
