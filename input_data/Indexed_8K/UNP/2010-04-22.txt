"Union Pacific's record first quarter was a strong start for the year," said Jim Young, Union Pacific chairman and chief executive officer. "We saw quarterly volume growth on our railroad for the first time in two years, and we leveraged that volume by running a safe, service-focused, and efficient network. These efforts resulted in a best ever first quarter operating ratio and generated strong cash from operations, setting a solid foundation for future opportunity and growth."
First Quarter Summary
First quarter business volumes, as measured by total revenue carloads, grew 13 percent versus the prior year's recession-impacted levels. Five of Union Pacific's six business groups reported quarterly growth, with only Energy volumes declining versus first quarter 2009. Quarterly volume growth contributed to a 16 percent increase in first quarter 2010 operating revenues of $4.0 billion versus $3.4 billion in the first quarter 2009. In addition:

Outlook

"Our plan is to remain flexible and run a safe, efficient network that generates significant volume leverage. As customers continue to benefit from UP's strong value proposition, we expect to attract new business to the railroad while delivering higher shareholder returns."
