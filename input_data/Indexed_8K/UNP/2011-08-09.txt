(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A) the unaudited financial statements, if any, included or incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or are not in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement;
(B) the unaudited capsule information, if any, included in the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement does not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which it was derived or was not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement;
(C) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the Terms Agreement, there was any change in the common stock or any increase in debt due within one year or debt due after one year of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, there was any decrease in common shareholders' equity, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included in the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement; or
(D) for the period from the date of the latest income statement included in the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the Terms Agreement, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, in consolidated operating revenues, operating income, income before extraordinary items or net income; except in all cases set forth in clauses (C) and
 
(D) above for changes or decreases which the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement disclose have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(iii) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information included in the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are contained in the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter. All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement shall be deemed included in the General Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement, respectively.
(g) The Representatives shall have received a letter dated the Closing Date, of Deloitte & Touche LLP, or any successor firm, which meets the requirements of subsection (f) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than five days prior to the Closing Date for purposes of this subsection and all references to the General Disclosure Package shall be references to the Final Prospectus.
The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably request.
7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement at any time, any Statutory Prospectus as of any time, the Final Prospectus or an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is
Indemnification and Contribution.
 
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package at any time, the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought
 
under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend,
 
upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
8. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under this Agreement and the Terms Agreement, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, such Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 9. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. The respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts of the Securities set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by the Company.
Default of Underwriters.
The foregoing obligations and agreements set forth in this Section will not apply if the Terms Agreement specifies that such obligations and agreements will not apply.
9. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Representatives have been retained solely to act as underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities and that no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Company and the Representatives has been created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the related Terms Agreement, the General Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, irrespective of whether the Representatives have advised or is advising the Company on other matters; (b) the price of the Securities set forth in the Terms Agreement was established by the Company following discussions and arms-length negotiations with the Representatives; (c) the Company has been advised that the Representatives and their affiliates are engaged in a broad range of transactions which may involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the Representatives have no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions to the Company by virtue of any fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship.
Absence of Fiduciary Relationship

10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters under the Terms Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 8 or the occurrence of any event specified in Section 6(b), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Securities.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.

provided, however,
"Primary Treasury Dealer"
means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations"
Notice of the redemption will be mailed to Holders of Notes by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, the particular Notes or portions thereof for redemption from the Outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, the notice of any such redemption occurring before March 15, 2041 need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price for any such redemption promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation.
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above, and notice of such redemption has been given to the Holders of the Notes in accordance with the Indenture, the Company will be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Holder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following a Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to a Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and
 
offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
"Exchange Act"
On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer;
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Paying Agent the Notes properly accepted, together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being purchased by the Company and that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture to the repurchase offer and to the repurchase by the Company of the Notes pursuant to the repurchase offer have been complied with.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of an integral multiple of $1,000.
The Company will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
means, with respect to the Notes on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control; or (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention by the Company to effect a Change of Control, the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies.
"Below Investment Grade Ratings Event"
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Ratings Event).
means the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" or "group" (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or its subsidiaries, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.
"Change of Control"
means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event with respect to the Notes.
"Change of Control Repurchase Event"
means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody's); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P); and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company.
"Investment Grade"
means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
"Moody's"
means (1) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
"Rating Agency"
means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc.
"S&P"
of any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
"Voting Stock"
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into supplemental indentures to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series under the Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected thereby on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series. The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults and their consequences with respect to such series under the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the place, rate and respective times and in the coin or currency herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions therein set forth, including the deposit of certain trust funds in trust, the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by, and the obligations under, the Securities of any series and to have satisfied all the obligations (with certain exceptions) under the Indenture relating to the Securities of such series.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, designated for such purpose, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture.

No charge shall be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
This Note shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefits under the Indenture, or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

In connection with this opinion, I, or attorneys under my supervision, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents and proceedings as I have considered necessary for the purposes of this opinion. I, or attorneys under my supervision, have also examined and am familiar with the proceedings taken by the Company to authorize the issuance and sale of the Notes. In addition, I have examined a copy of the Registration Statement, including the exhibits thereto, and a copy of the Prospectus dated February 10, 2010 (the ) included in the Registration Statement and a copy of a Prospectus Supplement to the Prospectus, dated August 4, 2011 (the ).

In rendering this opinion I have assumed, without independent investigation: (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals; (ii) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted as certified or photostatic copies; and (iii) the genuineness
of all signatures. As to questions of material fact relating to the opinions expressed herein, I have relied upon such certificates of public officials, corporate agents and officers of the Company and such other certificates as I have deemed relevant.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and other qualifications and limitations set forth herein, I am of the opinion that when the Notes have been duly executed, delivered and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and the consideration for the Notes has been duly received by the Company, all in the manner contemplated by the said Registration Statement, the Notes will be legally issued and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
My opinion is limited in all respects to the corporate laws of the State of Utah, the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the United States of America, and I express no opinion with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction. Please note that I am opining only as to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion should be inferred as to any other matters. This opinion is provided as of the date hereof and is based upon currently existing statutes, rules, regulations and judicial decisions, and I disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of these sources of law or subsequent legal or factual developments that might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.
In addition, I hereby consent to the use of my opinion included herein and to the use of my name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement.
