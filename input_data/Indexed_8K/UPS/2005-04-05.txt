ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. Beginning with our fiscal year that commenced on January 1, 2005, we have changed our reporting segments to reflect recent changes in our business. Prior to this change, our reporting segments were U.S. Domestic Package, International Package and Non-package. Our reporting segments now are U.S. Domestic Package, International Package and Supply Chain Solutions. The revised segment information sets forth our restated consolidated financial information by segment for each of the years in the four-year period ended December 31, 2004, corresponding to our change in reporting segments. This change does not affect our consolidated revenue, operating profit, net income or cash flows. U.S. domestic package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States. The domestic portion of the former excess value package insurance business has been discontinued and replaced by a declared value product that is managed as part of this segment. Consequently, the revenue and expenses in prior periods associated with the domestic portion of the former excess value package insurance business have been moved to the U.S. Domestic Package segment for comparative purposes. In addition, intersegment operating profit previously included in the results of our former Non-package segment has been eliminated within the U.S. domestic package segment. International package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the U.S., as well as shipments with either origin or destination outside the U.S. Our international package reporting segment includes the operations of our Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Americas regions. The international portion of the former excess value package insurance business has been discontinued and replaced by a declared value product that is managed as part of this segment. Consequently, the revenue and expenses in prior periods associated with the international portion of the former excess value package insurance business have been moved to the International Package segment for comparative purposes. Supply Chain Solutions includes our freight services and logistics operations and other aggregated business units. Our freight services and logistics operations are comprised of our former UPS Freight Services and UPS Logistics Group, including the operations acquired with the purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding. Freight services and logistics includes supply chain design and management, freight distribution and customs brokerage services. Other aggregated business units within this segment include Mail Boxes, Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes, Etc. and The UPS Store), UPS Capital, mail, consulting and professional services. The revised segment information was posted on the investor relations page of our website located at www.shareholder.com/ups on April 5, 2005 to provide historical data in a format consistent with how we anticipate reporting first quarter 2005 operating results later in April.
