On August 29, 2007, the Board of Directors of United Parcel Service, Inc. (the "Company") elected F. Duane Ackerman, the former chairman and CEO of BellSouth, to serve as a Director. Mr. Ackerman was appointed to serve on the Compensation Committee. He will stand for election at the annual meeting of shareowners in May 2008.
Mr. Ackerman's compensation for his services as a director will be consistent with that of the Company's other non-employee directors, as described in the Company's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 19, 2007. Other than the standard compensation arrangements, there are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Ackerman and any other person pursuant to which he was appointed as a director. Mr. Ackerman is not a party to any transaction with the Company that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
