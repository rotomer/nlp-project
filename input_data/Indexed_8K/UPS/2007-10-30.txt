     The Board of Directors of United Parcel Service, Inc. ("UPS") approved an increase in its share repurchase program, authorizing UPS to purchase up to $2.0 billion of UPS common stock. This replaces the approximately $50 million that remained available under the February 2007 share repurchase authorization of $2.0 billion. Effective immediately, purchases under the program may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
