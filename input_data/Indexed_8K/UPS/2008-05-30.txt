This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company designated as its Medium-Term Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes are issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of August 26, 2003 (herein called the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.

The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. shall act as Trustee with respect to the Notes (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee with respect to the Notes under the Indenture). The terms of individual Notes may vary with respect to interest rates or interest rate formulas, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000.
Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, the Notes will be issued in global form only registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee. The Notes will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and ownership of the Notes shall be maintained in book entry form by DTC for the accounts of participating organizations of DTC ("DTC Participants").
This Note is not subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise provided above in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs, is not redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
If no Redemption Date is set forth above, this Note may not be redeemed prior to the Stated Maturity Date. If so provided above, this Note may be redeemed by the Company on any Redemption Date specified above in whole or part in increments of $1,000 (unless specified otherwise in an Addendum attached hereto, and provided that any remaining principal hereof shall be at least $1,000) at the option of the Company at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined below) together with accrued interest hereon at the applicable rate payable to the applicable Redemption Date upon notice by first-class mail, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date specified in such notice. In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the surrender hereof.
Unless otherwise specified in an Addendum attached hereto, the "Redemption Price" shall be 100% of the principal amount of this Note.
Unless otherwise specified in an Addendum attached hereto, this Note is not subject to repayment at the option of the Holder other than pursuant to the Survivor's Option (as defined below). If this Note shall be repayable at the option of the Holder as specified in an attached Addendum hereto, unless otherwise specified in such Addendum, on any Optional Repayment Date, this Note shall be repayable in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 (unless specified otherwise in an Addendum attached hereto, and provided that any remaining principal hereof shall be at least $1,000) at the option of the Holder hereof at the applicable Repayment Price set forth on the face hereof, together with interest thereon payable to the date of repayment. If specified as repayable at the option of the Holder in such Addendum, for this Note to be repaid in whole or in part at the option of the Holder hereof, this Note and a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby must be received by the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or such
address which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holders of the Notes, not more than 45 nor less than 30 days prior to the related Optional Repayment Date or such other time as is specified in an Addendum attached hereto. Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable.
If so specified on the face hereof, the holder of this Security shall have the option to elect repayment of this Security in the event of the death of the beneficial owner of this Security (the "Survivor's Option"). The provisions of this section ("Survivor's Option") shall apply only if the Survivor's Option is so specified on the face of this Security. If the Survivor's Option is so specified, the Company shall, at its option, repay or purchase this Security (or portion thereof) properly tendered for repayment by or on behalf of the person (the "Representative") that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased owner of the beneficial interest in this Security under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative, executor, surviving joint tenant or surviving tenant by the entirety of such deceased beneficial owner) at a price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of this Security (or, if this is a zero-coupon Security, the amortized face amount of this Security on the date of such repayment), and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such repayment, subject to the following limitations. The Survivor's Option may not be exercised until twelve (12) months following the Original Issue Date. In addition, the Company may, in its sole discretion, limit the aggregate principal amount of Securities (or portions thereof) as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in any calendar year (the "Annual Put Limitation") to the greater of one percent (1%) of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Securities as of December 31 of the most recently completed year, or $1,000,000. The Company may limit to $200,000, or such greater amount as the Company in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of Securities (or portions thereof) as to which exercise of the Survivor's Option will be accepted in such calendar year with respect to any individual deceased owner or beneficial interests in Securities with the Survivor's Option (the "Individual Put Limitation"). The Company shall not make principal repayments pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option in amounts that are less than $1,000, and in the event that the limitations described in the preceding sentence would result in the partial repayment of this Security, the principal amount of this Security remaining outstanding after repayment must be at least $1,000 (the minimum Authorized Denomination). Except as provided in the immediately succeeding paragraph, exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be irrevocable.
Each Security with the Survivor's Option (or portion thereof) that is tendered pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted promptly in the order all such Securities are tendered, except for any Security (or portion thereof) the acceptance of which would contravene (i) the Annual Put Limitation, if applied, or (ii) the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, with respect to the relevant individual deceased owner of beneficial interests therein. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of Securities (or portions thereof) that have been accepted pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option during such year has not exceeded the Annual Put Limitation, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to Securities (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, with respect to an individual deceased owner of beneficial interests therein shall be accepted in the order all such Securities (or portions thereof) were tendered, to the extent that any such exercise would not trigger the Annual Put Limitation for such calendar year. This Security (or any portion hereof) accepted for payment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be repaid no later than the first January 15 or June 15 that occurs at least 20 calendar days after the date of such acceptance. If such date is not a Business Day, payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day. This Security (or any portion hereof) tendered for repayment that is not accepted in any calendar year due to the application of the Annual Put Limitation shall be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order in which all Securities subject to the Survivor's Option (or portions thereof) were originally tendered, unless any such Security (or portion thereof) is withdrawn by the Representative for the deceased owner prior to its repayment. Other than as described in the immediately preceding sentence, Securities delivered upon exercise of the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn. In the event that this Security (or any portion hereof) tendered for repayment pursuant to the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Trustee shall deliver a notice by first-class mail to the holder hereof at its last known address as indicated in the Register that states the reason this Security (or portion hereof) has not been accepted for payment.
Subject to the foregoing, in order for a Survivor's Option to be validly exercised with respect to this Security (or portion hereof), the Trustee must receive from the Representative of the deceased owner (i) a written request for repayment signed by the Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) tender of this Security (or portion to be repaid hereof) to the Trustee, (iii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Trustee that (A) the Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner, (B) the death of such beneficial owner has occurred and (C) the deceased was the owner of a beneficial interest in this Security at the time of death, (iv) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, and (v) if the beneficial interest in this Security is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Trustee from such nominee attesting to the deceased's ownership of a beneficial interest in this Security. Subject to the Company's right hereunder to limit the principal amount of Securities as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in any one calendar year due to the Annual Put Limitation or the Individual Put Limitation, all questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Trustee, in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties.
The death of a person owning this Security in joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety with another or others shall be deemed the death of the holder of this Security, and the entire principal amount of this Security so held shall be subject to repayment, together with interest accrued thereon to the repayment date. The death of a person owning this Security by tenancy in common shall be deemed the death of a holder of this Security only with respect to the deceased holder's interest in this Security so held by tenancy in common; except that in the event this Security is held by a husband and wife as tenants in common, the death of either shall be deemed the death of the holder of this Security, and the entire principal amount of this Security shall be subject to repayment. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of this Security shall be deemed the death of the holder thereof for the purpose of this provision, regardless of the registered holder, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Trustee. Such beneficial interest shall be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife and trust arrangements where one person has substantially all of the beneficial ownership interest in this Security during his or her lifetime.
For so long as this Security is a Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee shall be the holder of this Security and shall be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option for the beneficial holders of this Security. To exercise the Survivor's Option with respect to this Security, the Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in this Security is held by the deceased owner (i) the documents described in clauses (i) and (iii) of the second preceding paragraph and (ii) instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depositary of such Representative's desire to obtain repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option. Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Trustee (i) the documents received from the Representative referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and (ii) a certificate satisfactory to the Trustee from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option to the appropriate Representative.
In the event of redemption or repayment of this Security or the exercise of the Survivor's Option in part only, the principal amount of this Security shall be reduced.
The interest rate borne by this Note shall be determined as follows:
1. If this Note is designated as a Regular Floating Rate Note above, then, except as described below, this Note shall bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the applicable Interest Rate Basis shown above (i) plus or minus the applicable Spread, if any, and/or (ii) multiplied by the applicable Spread Multiplier, if any, specified and applied in the manner described

Unless otherwise specified above, interest with respect to Notes for which the interest rate is calculated with reference to two or more Interest Rate Bases will be calculated in the same manner as if only one of the applicable Interest Rate Bases applied.

"CPI(t-12)" means the Index Level of CPI for the calendar month that is 12 calendar months prior to the calendar month of the Index Level of CPI used for purposes of CPI(t). If the CPI for the second calendar month preceding the applicable CPI Adjustment Rate Interest Determination Date is not reported on Bloomberg CPURNSA or any successor service by 3:00 PM on the CPI Adjustment Rate Interest Determination Date, but has otherwise been published by the BLS, the Calculation Agent will determine the CPI as published by the BLS for such second calendar month preceding the applicable CPI Adjustment Rate Interest Determination Date using such other source as on its face, and after consultation with the Company, appears to accurately set forth the CPI, as published by the BLS.
Determination of CPI Adjustment Rate
In calculating CPI(t) and CPI(t-12) on the applicable CPI Adjustment Rate Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will use the most recently available Index Level of the CPI for the applicable second month preceding the applicable CPI Adjustment
Rate Interest Determination Date, even if such Index Level has been adjusted from a prior reported value for the relevant month. However, if a value of CPI(t) or CPI(t-12) used by the Calculation Agent on any CPI Adjustment Rate Interest Determination Date to determine the interest rate on the Notes of this series (an "Initial CPI") is subsequently revised by the BLS, the Calculation Agent will continue to use the Initial CPI, and the interest rate determined will not be revised.

If, while Floating Rate Notes bearing interest at the CPI Adjustment Rate are outstanding, the CPI is discontinued or, in the opinion of the BLS, as evidenced by a public release, which opinion is concurred with by the Company, substantially altered, the applicable substitute index for such Floating Rate Notes will be that chosen by the Secretary of the Treasury for the Department of Treasury's Inflation-Linked Treasuries as described at 62 Federal Register 846-874 (January 6, 1997), and the procedures described in above will be adapted by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Company in accordance with general market practice at the time for calculating an interest rate based on changes in such substitute index, provided that the procedure for determining the resulting interest rate is administratively acceptable to the Calculation Agent.
If, while Floating Rate Notes bearing interest at the CPI Adjustment Rate are outstanding, the CPI is discontinued or, in the opinion of the BLS, as evidenced by a public release, which opinion is concurred with by the Company, substantially altered, and if at such time or thereafter no Inflation-Linked Treasuries are outstanding, at such time as no Inflation-Linked Treasuries are outstanding the applicable substitute index for such Floating Rate Notes will be determined by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Company in accordance with general market practice at the time, and the procedures described above will be adapted by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Company in accordance with general market practice at the time for calculating an interest rate based on changes in such substitute index, provided that the procedure for determining the resulting interest rate is administratively acceptable to the Calculation Agent.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for United Parcel Service, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement dated May 30, 2008 (the "Distribution Agreement") among the Purchasing Agent named therein and the Company, pursuant to which the Purchasing Agent may solicit from time to time offers to purchase up to $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of UPS Notes (the "Notes") registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and issued pursuant to the Indenture dated as of August 26, 2003 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Indenture"). Capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Distribution Agreement.
We have reviewed such matters of law and examined original, certified, conformed or photographic copies of such other documents, records, agreements and certificates as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In such review we have assumed the genuineness of signatures on all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all copies submitted to us as certified, conformed or photographic copies, and, as to certificates of public officials, we have assumed the same to be accurate and to have been given properly. We have relied, as to the matters set forth therein, on certificates of public officials.
We have assumed that the Indenture is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Trustee. We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures on the Indenture and the Notes.
As to certain matters of fact material to this opinion, we have relied to the extent we deemed appropriate, without independent verification, upon (i) certificates of officers of the Company and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
Distribution Agreement. This opinion is limited in all respects to the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York and the Delaware General Corporation Law, and no opinion is expressed with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction or any effect that such laws may have on the opinions expressed herein. This opinion is limited to the matters stated herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when the terms thereof have been established in accordance with the Indenture and when executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in the manner provided for in the Indenture against payment therefor in the manner provided for in the Distribution Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
This opinion is delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, may be relied upon only by you in connection therewith, may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or by anyone else for any purpose, and may not be quoted, published or otherwise disseminated without our prior written consent.
This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update this opinion letter to reflect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in any laws or regulations that may hereafter occur.
Very truly yours,

Dear Sirs:
United Parcel Service, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Purchasing Agent") with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its UPS Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of August 26, 2003, as amended or modified from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Citibank, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee"). As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to U.S.$500,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of the Notes to or through the Purchasing Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold to or through the Purchasing Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.
This Agreement specifies the terms and conditions on which the Notes may be sold by the Company (i) to the Purchasing Agent as principal for resale and (ii) directly to investors and other purchasers through the Purchasing Agent as an agent of the Company in soliciting offers for the purchase of the Notes.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-147737) providing for the registration of the sale of certain securities of the Company, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"), and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes. Such registration statement became effective upon filing with the
Commission pursuant to Section 462(e) of the 1933 Act Regulations ("Rule 462(e)") and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement (as so amended from time to time prior to any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes) is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and the final prospectus and all applicable amendments or supplements thereto (including the final prospectus supplement and pricing supplement relating to such offer of Notes), in the form first furnished or otherwise made available to the Purchasing Agent for use in connection with such offer of Notes, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus". A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus, prospectus supplement and/or pricing supplement used before the acceptance by the Company of an offer for a purchase of Notes which omitted information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations ("Rule 424(b)"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, all references to the "Registration Statement", the "Prospectus" and any preliminary prospectus shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), prior to any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "disclosed", "contained", "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which are incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the 1933 Act Regulations to be part of or included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or a preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, prior to any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to include information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the 1933 Act Regulations to be part of or included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or such preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, at or after any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes.
SECTION 1. .
Appointment as Purchasing Agent
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf, the Company hereby agrees that the Notes will be sold exclusively to or through the Purchasing Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Company agrees that it will not appoint any other agents to act on its behalf, or to assist it, in the placement of the Notes.
Appointment
(b) . The Company shall not sell or approve the solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time or in excess of the aggregate initial offering price of Notes registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Purchasing Agent shall have no responsibility for maintaining
Sale of Notes
 
records with respect to the aggregate initial offering price of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale, under the Registration Statement.
(c) . The Purchasing Agent shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal. However, absent an agreement between the Purchasing Agent and the Company for the Purchasing Agent to act as an agent for the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall be deemed to be acting as principal in connection with any offering of Notes by the Company. Accordingly, the Purchasing Agent may agree from time to time to purchase Notes from the Company as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers determined by such Purchasing Agent. Any purchase of Notes from the Company by the Purchasing Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof.
Purchases as Principal
(d) . If agreed upon between the Purchasing Agent and the Company, the Purchasing Agent, acting solely as an agent for the Company and not as principal, will solicit offers for the purchase of Notes. The Purchasing Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer for the purchase of Notes solicited by it on an agency basis other than those offers rejected by the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any offer for the purchase of Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein. The Company may accept or reject any offer for the purchase of Notes, in whole or in part. The Purchasing Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer for the purchase of Notes has been solicited by it on an agency basis and accepted by the Company. The Purchasing Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event that any such purchase is not consummated for any reason other than to repay the Company any commission paid to the Purchasing Agent with respect thereto. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer has been solicited by the Purchasing Agent on an agency basis and accepted by the Company, the Company shall hold the Purchasing Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company.
Solicitations as Agent
(e) . The Company and the Purchasing Agent agree that any Notes purchased from the Company by the Purchasing Agent as principal shall be purchased, and any Notes the placement of which the Purchasing Agent arranges as an agent of the Company shall be placed by the Purchasing Agent, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.

(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Purchasing Agent and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, counsel to the indemnified shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
Actions Against Parties; Notification
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 or 9 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
SECTION 9. .
Contribution
If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and bear to the total discount or commission received by the Purchasing Agent, as the case may be.
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasing Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Purchasing Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Purchasing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any applicable untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) the Purchasing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount or commission received by the Purchasing Agent in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification exceeds the amount of any damages which the Purchasing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any applicable untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls the Purchasing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Purchasing Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, and each officer and director of such person shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
