The representative or representatives of the Underwriters, if any, specified in Schedule I hereto are hereinafter referred to as the "Representatives".
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-170435), including the related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses, which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). Such registration statement covers the registration of the Designated Securities under the Act. Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B and Rule 424(b) under the Act. Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information."

430B or Rule 430C under the Act shall be considered to be included in such registration statement, as amended, as of the time specified in Rule 430B or 430C, as the case may be. The final prospectus in the form first furnished to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement and any preliminary prospectuses that form a part thereof, is herein called the "Prospectus."

(iv) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture and this Agreement by the Company, the issuance and sale of the Designated Securities by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein by the Company (a) do not and will not result in any violation of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company and (b) do not and will not result in a breach or violation by the Company of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default by the Company under, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any Significant Subsidiary filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or the documents incorporated by reference therein. The Company has the corporate
 
power and authority to issue and sell the Designated Securities as contemplated by this Agreement.
(v) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture, this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Designated Securities by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein by the Company do not and will not result in a violation of any existing material law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company.
(vi) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required to be obtained by the Company for the issuance, sale and delivery of the Designated Securities by the Company or for the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such as have been obtained and made under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under state securities laws.
(vii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(viii) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act, and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending under the Act; and the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of its issue date and the Time of Delivery, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations (in each case other than the financial statements and notes thereto, the financial statement schedules and other financial data and Form T-1 included or incorporated by reference therein).
(ix) The Company is not required, and upon the issuance and sale of the Designated Securities as herein contemplated and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be required, to register as an "investment company" under the 1940 Act.

In addition, such counsel shall state that, in its capacity as counsel for the Company, it has rendered legal advice and assistance in connection with the Company's preparation of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. Rendering such assistance included, among other things, discussions and inquiries concerning various legal matters, the review of certain documents, and participating in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the Company's independent auditors and representatives of the
 
Underwriters and their counsel during which the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and reviewed. Such counsel shall state that although it is not passing upon and does do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, except as set forth in Section (d)(iii) above, on the basis of the information that was developed in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, nothing has come to its attention that causes it to believe that (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (b) that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company, as of the issue date thereof and as of the Time of Delivery, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; except that, with respect to clauses (a), (b) and (c), such counsel does not express a belief with respect to the financial statements and notes thereto and the financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, and with respect to clause (a), such counsel does not express a belief with respect to the Form T-1.
(e) A representative of the Legal Department of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives shall have furnished to the Representatives his or her written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
(i) The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases material properties or in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification and in which the failure to be so qualified would result in a Material Adverse Change.
(ii) Each subsidiary of the Company that is a "significant subsidiary", as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Act (each a "Significant Subsidiary"), has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases substantial properties or in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Change.
(iii) The statements in (a) the documents incorporated by reference into the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus under the captions "Government
 
Regulation" and "Legal Proceedings" in the Company's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1 of the Company's subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, if any (or comparable paragraphs under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part I, Item 2 of such Quarterly Reports or Form 10-Q, as the case may be), and (b) the Registration Statement under Item 15, insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of the documents (or provisions thereof), statutes (or provisions thereof) or legal proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information required to be described with respect to such documents (or provisions thereof), statutes (or provisions thereof) or legal proceedings and accurately summarize in all material respects such documents (or provisions thereof), statutes (or provisions thereof) or legal proceedings.
(iv) To the knowledge of such counsel, (a) there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party, or to which any of the properties of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is subject, that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and are not so described, and (b) there are no statutes, regulations or contracts that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.
(v) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture, this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Designated Securities by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein by the Company do not and will not result in a violation of any material judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree known to such counsel of any governmental authority or court having jurisdiction over the Company.
(f) As of the date hereof, the Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
At the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter, dated as of the Time of Delivery, to the effect that they reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to this first paragraph of this subsection (f), except that the specified date referred to shall be a date not more than three business days prior to the Time of Delivery.
(g) Since the execution and delivery of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained any loss or interference with its business from any calamity, labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of
 
this Agreement), and there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than changes due to (i) repurchases of common stock of the Company pursuant to previously announced stock repurchase programs, (ii) issuances or other transfers of capital stock in the ordinary course of business pursuant to the Company's employee benefit plans and (iii) conversions of shares of the Company's class A common stock into shares of the Company's class B common stock) or a material increase in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or any change, or any development reasonably likely to result in a change, in or affecting the business, financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement) reviewed by the Representatives at the time of execution and delivery of this Agreement, the effect of which in any such case is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the General Disclosure Package.
(h) On or after the date of this Agreement (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 15E of the Exchange Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock.
(i) On or after the date of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any material adverse change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the General Disclosure Package.
(j) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 4(c) hereof.
(k) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (h) of this Section 6 and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become
 
subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or the General Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus, relating to the Designated Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use therein relating to the Designated Securities.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 7, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus, including any pricing supplement, relating to the Designated Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.
In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnified party or parties
 
shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one proceeding or series of related proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such proceeding).
No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
 
prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to the Designated Securities and not joint.
pro rata
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to the Designated Securities and not joint and in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
8. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person
 
substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
10. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 5 and 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 5 and 7 hereof.
 
 
11. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in Schedule I to this Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in Schedule I to this Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
12. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Designated Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arms-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (b) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, or its stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (c) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and (e) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
13. In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
 
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, DC is open for business.
16. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
17. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
18. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.
 
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us four counterparts hereof, and upon acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this Agreement shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this Agreement on behalf of each of the Underwriters is or will be pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on the part of the Representatives as to the authority of the signers thereof.

In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series issued under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.

The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment or delivery of
the Maturity Consideration hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall affect or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the Maturity Consideration and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the manner, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and in this Security, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the Maturity Consideration and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series issued under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.
