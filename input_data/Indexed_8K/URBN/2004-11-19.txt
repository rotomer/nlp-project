Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 15, 2005, Urban Outfitters, Inc. entered into an Acquisition and Development Agreement with the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development. The Company has agreed to purchase, for nominal consideration, certain properties, and to lease certain other properties located in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The Company intends to relocate its corporate headquarters to this new location after it completes the necessary renovation and development. The Company believes the new headquarters, when completed, will accommodate its anticipated growth.
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company has also been granted options to purchase and rights of first offer with respect to additional properties located in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The renovation and development of the properties will be at the Company's sole expense, although the Company will be reimbursed for a portion of its fit-out costs and will be provided certain enumerated services and amenities. The agreement provides for a due diligence period, during which the Company will conduct an investigation of the properties, including without limitation, environmental and structural testing, as well as the availability of certain tax incentives. The closing of the transaction described in the Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
