Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle consumer products company operating under the Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters brands, today announced sales for the three months ended April 30, 2005.
 
Total Company sales for the first quarter jumped 36% over the same period last year to a record $231.3 million. The following factors drove this increase:
 
An 11% increase in total Company comparable store sales
A 29% increase in the number of stores in operation resulting in new and noncomparable store sales increases of $30.8 million
A 54% gain in direct-to-consumer sales; and
A 69% jump in Free People wholesale sales
The total Company comparable store sales increase of 11% during the first quarter anniversaries a 32% 'comp' increase during the same period last year. 'Comp' store sales at the Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters brands increased by 9%, 45% and 13% respectively.
 
"The bar was high and our merchants did a terrific job of increasing productivity in existing stores," said Richard A. Hayne, Chairman and President. "It's very gratifying to deliver the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit 'comp' store sales growth. The Direct and Wholesale businesses continue to provide strong growth and all major merchandise categories delivered year-over-year gains. These trends bode well for summer business," Mr. Hayne added.
 
Net sales for the three months were as follows:
 
Management expects to release financial results for the three months ended April 30, 2005 on May 12, 2005. During the first three months the Company opened two Anthropologie and two Urban Outfitters stores and expects to open a total of 30-32 new stores, including two to three Free People stores, in the current fiscal year.
