Method of Exercising Option
 
The Option Price shall be paid to the Company:

The Company shall be entitled to restrict the transferability of the shares issued upon any such exercise to the extent necessary to avoid a risk of violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or of any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.
