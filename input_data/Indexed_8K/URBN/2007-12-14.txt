On December 11, 2007, we excuted a renewal and amendment of our line of credit facility (the "Line") with Wachovia Bank, NA. The Line is a three-year $60.0 million revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase to $100.0 million at the Company's discretion. The Line contains a sub-limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by the Company. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability for share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends on our common shares.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
