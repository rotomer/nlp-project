MINNEAPOLIS, July 16, 2002  U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported operating earnings of $869.8 million for the second quarter of 2002, compared with $818.6 million for the second quarter of 2001. Operating earnings of $.45 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2002 were higher than the same period of 2001 by $.02 (4.7 percent). Return on average common equity and return on average assets, excluding merger and restructuring-related items, were 21.2 percent and 2.06 percent, respectively, in the second quarter of 2002, compared with returns of 21.0 percent and 1.99 percent in the second quarter of 2001.
     Including after-tax merger and restructuring-related items of $(46.7) million in the second quarter of 2002 and $(256.3) million the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded net income for the
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 2
second quarter of 2002 of $823.1 million, or $.43 per diluted share, compared with $562.3 million, or $.29 per diluted share, for the same period of 2001.
     U.S. Bancorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "I am very pleased with our second quarter operating results. We experienced solid core revenue growth over the same quarter of last year, and even more rewarding for me, core revenue growth of well over 14 percent annualized from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2002. We achieved this growth despite a challenging economy and having a significant amount of resources dedicated toward the successful completion of the integration of Firstar Corporation and the former U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis. Eighty-five percent of our customers are now on common deposit systems and we are on-track to be at 100 percent by the end of the third quarter. I am very proud of the hard work and accomplishments of our employeesnot only achieving outstanding revenue growth and flawlessly integrating the two companies, but for also embracing our Five Star Service Guarantee by continuing to deliver the high level of service that our customers have come to expect."
     Total revenue, before merger and restructuring-related gains, on a taxable-equivalent basis for the second quarter of 2002 grew by $276.7 million (9.7 percent) over the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to improvement in the net interest margin, acquisitions and core banking growth, partially offset by the impact of portfolio sales in 2001 and capital markets-related revenue.
     Total noninterest expense, before merger and restructuring-related items, increased over the second quarter of 2001 by $106.9 million (8.0 percent), primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions, core banking growth and impairment of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR"), partially offset by the impact to goodwill and other intangible expense with the required adoption of new accounting standards and cost savings from the Company's on-going integration efforts
.
     Provision for credit losses, before merger and restructuring-related items, for the second quarter of 2002 increased by $95.0 million (39.6 percent), from the second quarter of 2001, primarily reflecting higher net charge-offs and changes in the credit risk profile of the portfolio given the sluggish economic conditions.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 3
     Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2002 were $330.5 million, compared with the first quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $335.0 million and second quarter of 2001 net charge-offs of $240.3 million. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2002 reflected continuing weakness in the transportation, manufacturing, communications and technology sectors. Nonperforming assets increased from $1,110.8 million at March 31, 2002, to $1,147.7 million at June 30, 2002. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 241 percent at June 30, 2002, compared with 250 percent at March 31, 2002.
     During the first quarter of 2002, the Company fully adopted new accounting standards with respect to accounting for business combinations (SFAS 141) and goodwill and other intangible assets (SFAS 142). Management anticipates that applying the provisions of SFAS 141 to recent acquisitions and the provisions of SFAS 142 to purchase acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001, will increase after-tax income for the year ending December 31, 2002, by approximately $200 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Additionally, the Company recognized an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $37.2 million in the first quarter of 2002, primarily related to the purchase of a transportation leasing company in 1998 by the equipment leasing business. This charge was recognized as a "cumulative effect of change in accounting principles" in the income statement.
     On April 1, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of Cleveland-based The Leader Mortgage Company, LLC ("Leader Mortgage"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Defiance Financial Corp., in a cash transaction. Leader Mortgage had $506 million in assets at December 31, 2001, and an $8.6 billion servicing portfolio. In 2001 it had $2.1 billion in mortgage production.

Net Interest Income
     Second quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,689.8 million, compared with $1,574.8 million recorded in the second quarter of 2001. Average earning assets for the period increased over the second quarter of 2001 by $2.4 billion (1.6 percent), primarily driven by increases in the investment portfolio, core retail loan growth and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $1.0 billion reduction related to transfers of short-term, high credit quality, low margin commercial loans to Stellar Funding Group, Inc. (the "loan conduit"), a $616 million decline in residential mortgages and the securitization of a discontinued unsecured small business product in 2001.   The net interest margin in the second quarter of 2002 was 4.59 percent, compared with 4.62
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 5
percent in the first quarter of 2002 and 4.34 percent in the second quarter of 2001. The improvement in the net interest margin in the second quarter of 2002 over the second quarter of 2001 reflects the funding benefits of the declining rate environment, a more favorable funding mix and improving spreads due to product re-pricing dynamics and loan conduit transfers, partially offset by lower yields on the investment portfolioNet interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the second quarter of 2002 was higher than the first quarter of 2002, primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in average earning assets, driven by investment securities activities and the acquisition of Leader Mortgage, and day basis, which totaled $11.5 million, offset somewhat by a shift in funding mix toward longer term fixed-rate funding sources.

     Average loans for the second quarter of 2002 were $5.5 billion (4.6 percent) lower than the second quarter of 2001. Year-over-year loan growth was impacted by several management actions, including, the securitization of a discontinued unsecured small business product, branch divestitures, and transfers of short-term, high credit quality, low margin commercial loans to the loan conduit. On a core basis, average loans declined approximately $3.9 billion (3.2 percent) with growth in average retail loans more than offset by a decline in average residential mortgages, commercial and commercial real estate loans.
     Average loans for second quarter of 2002 were higher than the first quarter of 2002 by $309 million (.3 percent) reflecting growth in retail loans and the net run-off of commercial loans. Investment securities at June 30, 2002, were $9.6 billion higher than at June 30, 2001, and $5.9 billion higher than at March 31, 2002. Average investment securities for the second quarter of 2002
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 7
were $6.8 billion (31.8 percent) and $1.4 billion (5.2 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2001 and first quarter of 2002, respectively, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from loan sales and declines in commercial and commercial real estate loan balances. During the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold $2.4 billion of fixed-rate securities. A portion of the fixed-rate securities sold were replaced with floating-rate securities in conjunction with the Company's interest rate risk management strategies.

     Average noninterest-bearing deposits in the second quarter of 2002 were higher than the second quarter of 2001 by $2.8 billion (11.2 percent). Average interest-bearing deposits, however, declined by $7.6 billion (9.2 percent) from the second quarter of 2001. Growth in average savings products (2.9 percent) year-over-year was more than offset by reductions in the average balances of higher cost time certificates (17.9 percent) and time deposits greater than $100,000 (29.5 percent). The decline in time certificates and time deposits greater than $100,000 reflected funding decisions toward more favorably priced wholesale funding sources given the recent rate environment.

Noninterest Income
     Second quarter noninterest income, before merger and restructuring-related gains, was $1,437.3 million, an increase of $161.7 million (12.7 percent) from the same quarter of 2001, and a $110.4 million (8.3 percent) increase over the first quarter of 2002. The growth in noninterest income over the second quarter of 2001 was primarily driven by acquisitions, including NOVA Corporation ("NOVA"), Pacific Century Bank and Leader Mortgage, which contributed approximately $127.3 million of the favorable variance. Increases in revenue associated with the Company's core banking products also contributed to the strong revenue growth over the same period of 2001. Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and ATM processing services were higher in the second quarter of 2002 than the second quarter of 2001 by $18.0 (7.9 percent), primarily reflecting
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 9
growth in card usage. Merchant processing services grew by $113.0 million year-over-year, primarily due to the acquisition of NOVA. Trust and investment management fees improved in the second quarter of 2002 relative to a year ago by $6.9 million (3.0 percent) primarily due to growth in new business. Cash management fees and commercial product revenue grew by $19.4 million (22.9 percent) and $22.0 million (21.0 percent), respectively, in the second quarter of 2002 over the same period of 2001. The increase in cash management fees and commercial product revenue was primarily driven by growth in core business, loan conduit activities and product enhancements. In addition to the impact of Leader Mortgage, mortgage banking revenue increased in the second quarter of 2002 compared with the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to gains on the sale of servicing rights of $5.9 million. Offsetting these favorable variances were declines in capital markets-related revenue of $13.7 million (5.7 percent), reflecting softness in the equity capital markets, and a decrease in deposit service charges of $6.5 million (3.7 percent) from the same period of 2001.
        Noninterest income increased in the second quarter of 2002 by $110.4 million (8.3 percent) over the first quarter of 2002. Leader Mortgage contributed approximately $14.0 million to the growth in revenue, while gains on the sale of securities declined by approximately the same amount. The Company experienced strong growth in the second quarter of 2002 over the first quarter of 2002 in credit and debit card revenue (20.0 percent), as well as corporate payment products revenue (9.7 percent) and merchant processing services (8.1 percent), which were driven by higher sales/charge volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased 4.7 percent due, in part, to seasonal tax filing services in the second quarter of 2002. Deposit service charges increased 11.5 percent relative to the first quarter of 2002, while cash management fees were essentially unchanged. The growth in deposit service charges was primarily due to seasonality and revenue enhancement initiatives. In addition to the acquisition of Leader Mortgage, mortgage banking revenue increased in the second quarter of 2002 over the first quarter of 2002 due to higher gains on the sale of servicing rights. Capital markets-related revenues increased $13.2 million (6.2 percent) from the first quarter of 2002, while commercial product revenue increased $8.1 million (6.8 percent) over the same time period.

Noninterest Expense
     Second quarter noninterest expense, before merger and restructuring-related charges, totaled $1,448.8 million, an increase of $106.9 million (8.0 percent) over the second quarter of 2001. The increase in expense year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions, including NOVA, Pacific Century and Leader Mortgage, which accounted for approximately $113.5 million of the increase. In addition, the second quarter of 2002 included $14.3 million of MSR impairment and higher expenses due to core banking growth. Offsetting the increases in expense were the Company's on-going integration activities and the impact of adopting new accounting standards related to business combinations and the amortization of intangibles.
     Second quarter of 2002 noninterest expense, before merger and restructuring-related charges, was higher than the first quarter of 2002 by $86.2 million (6.3 percent). The unfavorable variance was primarily due to higher expenses related to capital markets activities, growth in payment processing, the acquisition of Leader Mortgage and a $14.3 million mortgage servicing rights impairment
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 11
recorded in the second quarter of 2002, in addition to seasonally higher operating expenses, including legal and professional, travel and entertainment and marketing and public relations.
     Earnings in the second quarter of 2002 included pre-tax net merger and restructuring-related items of $71.6 million. The total merger and restructuring-related items included $60.5 million of net expense associated with the Firstar/U.S. Bancorp merger. In addition, $11.1 million of expense was included in the second quarter of 2002 for NOVA and other smaller acquisitions.
     The $60.5 million of merger and restructuring-related items associated with the Firstar/U.S. Bancorp merger in the second quarter of 2002 was primarily related to systems conversions and integration and asset write-downs and lease terminations. Offsetting a portion of these costs were asset gains on the sale of a non-strategic investment in a sub-prime mortgage lending business.

Credit Quality
     The allowance for credit losses was $2,466.4 million at June 30, 2002, compared with the allowance for credit losses of $2,461.5 million at March 31, 2002. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 241 percent at June 30, 2002, compared with 250 percent at March 31, 2002. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.15 percent at June 30, 2002, equal to the ratio at March 31, 2002. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2002 were $330.5 million, compared with the first quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $335.0 million and the second quarter of 2001 net charge-offs of $240.3 million.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 13
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $152.2 million for the second quarter of 2002, or .88 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $163.3 million, or .94 percent of average loans outstanding, in the first quarter of 2002.
     Retail loan net charge-offs of $174.4 million in the second quarter of 2002 were higher than the first quarter of 2002 by $5.4 million (3.2 percent) and $24.3 million (16.2 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2001. The increase in retail loan net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2002 from the first quarter of 2002 was primarily due to seasonal increases in credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were 1.93 percent in the second quarter of 2002, compared with 1.95 percent and 1.83 percent in the first quarter of 2002 and second quarter of 2001, respectively.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 14
     The level of net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2002 reflects current economic conditions and continued weakness in the transportation, manufacturing, communications and technology sectors. Net charge-offs are expected to remain at elevated levels but are expected to trend lower by the end of the year.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 15
     Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2002, totaled $1,147.7 million, compared with $1,110.8 million at March 31, 2002, and $1,215.1 million at June 30, 2001. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 1.00 percent at June 30, 2002, compared with .97 percent at March 31, 2002, and 1.02 percent at June 30, 2001. Nonperforming assets are expected to remain at elevated levels for the remainder of the year and are expected to increase in the third quarter of 2002. The Company does not expect to see a significant reduction in the level of nonperforming assets until the economy rebounds.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 16
     Total shareholder's equity was $16,650 billion at June 30, 2002, compared with $15,456 billion at June 30, 2001. The increase was the result of corporate earnings, including merger and restructuring-related items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, offset by dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions.
     Tangible common equity to assets was 5.7 percent at June 30, 2002, compared with 5.8 percent at March 31, 2002, and 6.6 percent at June 30, 2001. The tier 1 capital ratio was 7.9 percent at June 30, 2002, compared with 7.7 percent at March 31, 2002, and 8.0 percent at June 30, 2001. The total risk-based capital ratio was 12.5 percent at June 30, 2002, compared with 12.4 percent at March 31, 2002, and 11.2 percent at June 30, 2001. The improvement in the total risk-based capital ratio in the second quarter of 2002 primarily reflects changes in the mix of investment securities in addition to the issuance of "trust preferred" securities in both the second and fourth quarters of 2001. The leverage ratio was 7.8 percent at June 30, 2002, compared with 7.6 percent at March 31, 2002, and 8.0 percent at June 30, 2001. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of stated "well capitalized" requirements.

     On December 18, 2001, the board of directors of U.S. Bancorp approved an authorization to repurchase 100 million shares of outstanding common stock over the next 24 months. During the second quarter of 2002, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock related to this authorization.

Lines of Business
     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business which include: Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, Payment Services, Capital Markets, and Treasury and Corporate Support. Business line results are derived from the Company's business unit profitability reporting systems. Designations, assignments and allocations may change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. All results for 2002 and 2001 have been restated to present consistent methodologies for all business lines.
     Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking contributed $378.9 million of the Company's operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002, a 5.2 percent decrease from the same period of 2001 and a 3.5 percent decline from the first quarter of 2002. The reduction in Wholesale Banking's second quarter 2002 contribution to operating earnings from the second quarter of 2001 was the result of lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense, offset slightly by a
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 19
favorable variance in the provision for credit losses. Total net revenue in the second quarter of 2002 was lower than the second quarter of 2001 by 3.4 percent, with a favorable variance in noninterest income (18.3 percent) more than offset by a decrease in net interest income (9.7 percent). The reduction in net interest income was primarily due to lower average loans outstanding (14.3 percent), partially offset by an increase in average deposits (13.0 percent) and a higher net interest margin. The transfer of short-term, high credit quality, low margin commercial loans to the loan conduit contributed $1.0 billion of the unfavorable variance in average loans outstanding year-over-year. Partially offsetting the decline in net interest income was an increase in noninterest income year-over-year, which was driven by cash management fees and commercial product revenue. Noninterest expense increased by 10.8 percent in the second quarter of 2002 over the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to asset write-downs related to the equipment finance business. Wholesale Banking's provision for credit losses improved by $2.5 million (9.2 percent) in the second quarter of 2002 over the same period of 2001, primarily due to a reduction in loans outstanding and an improvement in the overall credit risk profile of the business line's loan portfolio. The reduction in Wholesale Banking's contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 from the first quarter of 2002 was the result of essentially flat net revenue and unfavorable variances in noninterest expense (15.2 percent), driven by equipment finance losses, and provision for credit losses (25.3 percent).
     Consumer Banking delivers products and services to the broad consumer market and small businesses through banking offices, telesales, on-line services, direct mail and automated teller machines ("ATMs"). It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, small business banking, consumer lending, mortgage banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking, and investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking also includes the residential mortgage portfolio. Consumer Banking contributed $397.2 million of the Company's operating income in the second quarter of 2002, a 2.5 percent increase over the same period of 2001, and a 17.3 percent increase over the first quarter of 2002. The increase in Consumer Banking's second quarter 2002 contribution to operating earnings over the second quarter of 2001 was the result of a slight increase in net revenue (.9 percent) and a favorable variance in provision for credit losses (17.1 percent), partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense (2.2 percent). Although net interest income was flat compared with the same period of 2001, noninterest income rose by 3.1 percent. The growth in noninterest income was due to increases in mortgage banking revenue, cash management fees, securities gains, and investment products fees and commissions, offset by decreases in deposit
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 20
service charges, trust and investment management fees and other revenue. The increase in mortgage banking revenue can be attributed to the acquisition of Leader Mortgage and higher gains on the sale of servicing rights. Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2002 was higher than the second quarter of 2001 (2.2 percent), primarily due to the acquisition of Leader Mortgage and MSR impairment. The provision for credit losses was lower by $15.1 million (17.1 percent) in the second quarter of 2002 than the same period of 2001, primarily due to a reduction in charge-offs and an improvement in the portfolio's overall credit risk profile. The increase in Consumer Banking's contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 over the first quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
     Private Client, Trust and Asset Management provides mutual fund processing services, trust, private banking and financial advisory services through four businesses, including: the Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Institutional Trust and Custody, and Mutual Fund Services, LLC. The business segment also offers investment management services to several client segments including mutual funds, institutional customers, and private asset management. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed $119.2 million of the Company's operating income in the second quarter of 2002, a .6 percent decrease from the same period of 2001 and a 5.0 percent increase over the first quarter of 2002. The slight decrease in the business line's contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 from the second quarter of 2001 was the result of favorable variances in net revenue (1.9 percent) and provision for credit losses (45.0 percent), offset by an increase in noninterest expense (8.0 percent). Growth in net interest income (3.7 percent) in the second quarter of 2002 over the second quarter of 2001 was primarily driven by growth in average loans outstanding (7.8 percent). Noninterest income rose by 1.3 percent over the same period of 2001, due to an increase in trust and investment management fees. Noninterest expense was higher in the second quarter of 2002 than the same quarter of 2001, primarily due to a favorable loss recovery in the second quarter of 2001. Provision for credit losses was lower by $1.8 million (45.0 percent) in the second quarter of 2002 than the same period of 2001 due to lower net charge-offs. The increase in the business line's contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 over the first quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue, lower provision for credit losses, and a slight decrease in noninterest expense.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2002 Results July 16, 2002 Page 21
     Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $169.3 million of the Company's operating income in the second quarter of 2002, a 51.2 percent increase over the same period of 2001 and a 17.9 percent increase over the first quarter of 2002. The increase in Payment Services' contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 over the second quarter of 2001 was the result of higher net revenue (36.4 percent) and lower provision for credit losses (17.0 percent), offset by higher noninterest expense (74.3 percent). The growth in net revenue year-over-year was primarily due to the acquisition of NOVA, which contributed approximately $111.1 million to net revenue in the second quarter of 2002. In addition, credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and ATM processing services increased in total by $18.0 million in the second quarter of 2002 over the same period of 2001. Noninterest expense grew by $85.4 million in the second quarter of 2002 over the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to the acquisition of NOVA. The year-over-year reduction in provision for credit losses (17.0 percent) was primarily due to an improvement in the portfolio's overall credit risk profile. The increase in Payment Services' contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 over the first quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue, driven by improving sales volume, slightly lower provision for credit losses, and a slight decrease in noninterest expense.
     Capital Markets engages in equity and fixed income trading activities, offers investment banking and underwriting services for corporate and public sector customers and provides financial advisory services and securities, mutual funds, annuities and insurance products to consumers and regionally-based businesses through a network of brokerage offices. Capital Markets contributed $10.8 million of the Company's operating income in the second quarter of 2002, a 45.2 percent decline from the second quarter of 2001 and a 25.0 percent decrease from the first quarter of 2002. The decrease in Capital Market's contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 from the second quarter of 2001 was the result of a decline in net revenue (12.7 percent), partially offset by a favorable variance in noninterest expense (7.5 percent). The unfavorable variance in net revenue in the second quarter of 2002 to the same period of 2001 was primarily due to lower trading, investment products fees and commissions and investment banking revenues. The decrease in Capital Market's contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 from the first quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue (10.7 percent) that was more than offset by growth in noninterest expense (16.0 percent).

The slight reduction in the operating loss year-over-year was the net result of a $148.0 million increase in net interest income, offset by a $136.6 million increase in the residual allocation of the provision for credit losses. The decrease in the business line's contribution to operating earnings in the second quarter of 2002 from the first quarter of 2002 was the result of lower net revenue (3.6 percent), higher noninterest expense (6.5 percent) and an unfavorable variance in provision for credit losses (28.2 percent).
