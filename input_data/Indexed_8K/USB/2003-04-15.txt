Exhibit 99.1 [LOGO] US BANCORP News Release Contact: Steve Dale H.D. McCullough Judith T. Murphy Media Relations Investor Relations Investor Relations (612) 303-0784 (612) 303-0786 (612) 303-0783 U.S. BANCORP REPORTS 20.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR FIRST QUARTER 2003 MINNEAPOLIS, April 15, 2003 - U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") of $911.2 million for the first quarter of 2003, compared with $756.0 million for the first quarter of 2002. Net income of $.47 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2003 was higher than the same period of 2002 by $.08 (20.5 percent). Return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.01 percent and 20.0 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2003, compared with returns of 1.83 percent and 19.0 percent in the first quarter of 2002. Net income in the first quarter of 2003 included after-tax merger and restructuring-related items of ($11.5) million, or ($.01) per share, compared with ($48.4) million, or ($.03) per share, in the first quarter of 2002. Net income in the first quarter of 2002 also included an after-tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principles of ($37.2) million, or ($.02) per share. In accordance with new SEC rules required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, U.S. Bancorp's press release has been re-designed to
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 2 eliminate discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including operating earnings and per share information excluding the impact of merger and restructuring-related items. The Company's results for the first quarter of 2003 improved over the same period of 2002, primarily due to strong growth in consumer banking and payment services revenue, offset somewhat by lower investment banking activity. Notable favorable items in the current quarter included gains on the sale of securities of $140.7 million, an increase of $96.6 million over the first quarter of 2002. Offsetting this favorable item was the recognition of $120.9 million of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") impairment, driven by lower interest rates and related prepayments. U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "We are continuing to make good progress towards achieving our long-term goals and, as first quarter results demonstrate, we are also well on our way towards reaching our financial objectives for 2003. This quarter marked our second anniversary as the "new" U.S. Bancorp - a now fully integrated U.S. Bancorp. During the past two years, we capitalized on our operating synergies, expanded our business into new markets, reduced our risk profile, improved market share, increased our service capabilities, increased our purchasing power and leverage, lowered our overall cost structure, and enhanced our ability to launch new development and delivery technologies. As we move into our third year as the "new" U.S. Bancorp, we stand on a very solid foundation. For the first time in five years our management team is working together without the distraction of a major integration. We have financial stability and a clear customer focus. We have reinforced our commitment to the communities in which we do business. Our objectives for 2003 and beyond are clear. We need to increase the rate of organic growth by providing first-class products and services and delivering them in a superior way. We need to further enhance our already high service levels - it is our brand and we are committed to instilling its value both internally and externally. We need to remain disciplined in our desire to reduce volatility and the risk profile of the organization. Finally, we need to maintain tight expense control - one goal that will always be a part of this Company's agenda. I am proud of what we have accomplished but will not be satisfied until we deliver on the great potential of this new Company." Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the first quarter of 2003 grew by $303.3 million (10.1 percent) over the first quarter of 2002. This growth was primarily due to increases in net interest income, gains on the sale of securities, growth in consumer banking and payment services revenue, mortgage banking activities, and acquisitions. These positive variances were
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 3 partially offset year-over-year by lower capital markets activities. Approximately $70.1 million of the increase in net revenue year-over-year was due to acquisitions, including The Leader Mortgage Company, LLC ("Leader"), the 57 branches of Bay View Bank in California, and the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street Corporate Trust"). Total noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2003 was higher than the first quarter of 2002 by $131.2 million (9.1 percent), primarily reflecting the $120.9 million MSR impairment taken in the first quarter of 2003 and acquisitions, which accounted for approximately $53.2 million of expense growth year-over-year. Partially offsetting these increases in expense over the first quarter of 2002 was a reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges of $56.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. Provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2003 was $335.0 million, equal to the provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2002. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2003 were $333.8 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $378.5 million and first quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $335.0 million. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2003 reflected continuing weakness in the communications, transportation and manufacturing sectors, as well as the impact of the economy on highly leveraged enterprise value financings. Total nonperforming assets declined slightly from $1,373.5 million at December 31, 2002, to $1,362.6 million at March 31, 2003. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 194 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 196 percent at December 31, 2002, and 250 percent at March 31, 2002. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company recognized an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $37.2 million, primarily related to the purchase of a transportation leasing company in 1998 by the equipment leasing business. This charge was recognized as a "cumulative effect of change in accounting principles" in the income statement. On February 19, 2003, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to effect a spin-off of its capital markets business unit, including investment banking and brokerage activities primarily conducted by its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. It is anticipated that the spin-off will be completed in the third quarter of 2003.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 4 Net Interest Income First quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,783.8 million, compared with $1,670.4 million recorded in the first quarter of 2002. Average earning assets for the period increased over the first quarter of 2002 by $11.8 billion (8.1 percent), primarily driven by increases in investment securities, loans held for sale and retail loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. The net interest margin in the first quarter of 2003 was 4.56 percent, compared with 4.63 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 4.62 percent in the first quarter of 2002. The decline in the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2003 from the first quarter of 2002 primarily reflected the growth in investment securities as a percent of total earning assets. The decline in the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2003 from the fourth quarter of 2002 also reflected the change in mix towards lower rate investment securities. Despite the decline in
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 5 the net interest margin, net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2003 was higher than the fourth quarter of 2002, by $8.8 million (.5 percent), primarily due to a $5.2 billion increase in average earning assets, driven by investment securities, loans held for sale and growth in both residential mortgages and retail loans and partially offset by a $24.6 million decrease due to day basis.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 6 Average loans for the first quarter of 2003 were $2.6 billion (2.3 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2002. Strong growth in average retail loans of $2.6 billion (7.5 percent) and residential mortgages of $2.2 billion (27.2 percent) year-over-year was partially offset by an overall decline in commercial loans of $3.8 billion (8.4 percent), driven by the current credit market and soft economic conditions. Included in the change in the average of both commercial and commercial real estate loans outstanding in the first quarter of 2003 from the first quarter of 2002 was a reclassification of approximately $1.2 billion of commercial loans to other loan categories, including the commercial real estate category ($.5 billion) and residential mortgages ($.7 billion), in connection with conforming loan classifications at the time of system conversions during the third quarter of 2002. Prior quarters were not restated, as it was impractical to determine the extent of reclassification for all periods presented. Average loans for the first quarter of 2003 were higher than the fourth quarter of 2002 by $905 million (.8 percent), reflecting growth in retail loans and residential mortgages, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. The change in commercial
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 7 loans reflects slightly higher corporate-based loans offset by lower corporate purchasing card balances, leasing and mortgage warehousing loans. The impact of loan reclassifications relative to the fourth quarter was not significant. Average investment securities for the first quarter of 2003 were $7.6 billion (28.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2002, reflecting reinvestment of proceeds from loan sales, declines in commercial loan balances and deposits assumed in connection with the Bay View Bank branch acquisition. Investment securities at March 31, 2003, were $5.7 billion higher than at March 31, 2002, and $2.0 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2002. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold $5.7 billion of fixed-rate securities. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in the first quarter of 2003 were higher than the first quarter of 2002 by $5.3 billion (19.4 percent), primarily due to higher business and government banking demand deposit balances year-over-year. Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $8.5 billion (11.4 percent) over the first quarter of 2002. Approximately $3.5 billion of the increase in average interest-bearing deposits was due to acquisitions, while the remaining $5.0 billion of growth was driven by increases in savings products balances and the Company's funding decision to increase time deposits greater than $100,000.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 8 Total deposits in the first quarter of 2003 were $4.8 billion (4.3 percent) higher on average than the fourth quarter of 2002. Approximately $1.6 billion of the linked quarter growth was due to acquisitions, while the remaining increase of $3.2 billion (2.9 percent), principally in non-interest bearing deposits and savings products, was primarily attributable to growth in the Wholesale Banking business line. Noninterest Income First quarter noninterest income was $1,522.9 million, an increase of $189.9 million (14.2 percent) over the same quarter of 2002, but a $27.9 million (1.8 percent) decrease from the fourth quarter of 2002. The growth in noninterest income over the first quarter of 2002 was driven by net securities gains, payment services and consumer banking revenue, mortgage banking activity, and acquisitions, including Leader, the branches of Bay View Bank, and State Street Corporate Trust, which contributed approximately $45.3 million in noninterest revenue in the first quarter of 2003. Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and ATM processing services revenue in the Payment Services line of business were higher in the first quarter of 2003 than the
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 9 first quarter of 2002 by $34.9 million (16.2 percent), primarily reflecting growth in sales and card usage. Merchant processing services revenue was lower by $6.3 million (4.7 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to lower processing spreads resulting from changes in the mix of merchants. The favorable variance in trust and investment management fees of $6.0 million (2.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2003 over the same period of 2002 was driven by the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust, which contributed $19.2 million in fees during the first quarter of 2003, partially offset by the impact of a decline in equity valuations. Deposit service charges increased by $13.0 million (8.3 percent) over the first quarter of 2002, primarily due to volume and fee enhancements within the Consumer Banking line of business. Cash management fees revenue grew by $7.8 million (7.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2003 over the same period of 2002, with the majority of the variance within the Wholesale Banking line of business. The increase in cash management fees over the first quarter of 2002 was driven by growth in sales, product enhancements and lower earning credit rates to customers. Mortgage banking revenue in the Consumer Banking line of business increased by $43.4 million (83.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2003 over the first quarter of 2002 due to higher mortgage servicing, originations and sales and the acquisition of Leader, which contributed $22.2 million of the favorable variance. Offsetting these favorable variances was a decline in commercial products revenue of $18.0 million (14.7 percent) and capital markets-related revenue of $15.4 million (7.2 percent). The decline in commercial products revenue reflected lower conduit servicing fees, while the capital markets-related revenue continued to reflect softness in the equity capital markets. Somewhat offsetting the reduction in investment products fees and commissions within the Capital Markets group, was an increase in investment products fees and commissions of $3.0 million year-over-year within the Consumer Banking line of business, reflecting the expansion of investment product sales programs throughout the branch network, plus acquisitions. Other income was higher in the first quarter of 2003 over the same quarter of 2002 by $27.9 million (41.5 percent), due in part to favorable variances in income from equity investments. Noninterest income decreased in the first quarter of 2003 by $27.9 million (1.8 percent) from the fourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to seasonally lower credit and debit card revenue, merchant processing services revenue and deposit service charges, as well as lower capital markets related revenue, commercial products revenue and other income. The unfavorable variance in commercial products revenue was the result of a decline in conduit servicing revenue, partially
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 10 offset by higher lease-related revenues relative to the fourth quarter of 2002, which included a lease residual write-down. Offsetting these negative variances was an increase in net securities gains, cash management fees and revenue from acquisitions. Trust and investment fees included $19.2 million from the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust. Other fees were lower relative to the fourth quarter due to a gain on sale of a co-branded credit card portfolio recognized in the fourth quarter of 2002. Noninterest Expense First quarter noninterest expense totaled $1,574.1 million, an increase of $131.2 million (9.1 percent) over the first quarter of 2002. The increase in expense year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in MSR impairment of $120.9 million and the impact of recent acquisitions, including Leader, the branches of Bay View Bank and State Street Corporate Trust, which accounted for approximately $53.2 million of the increase. Offsetting these increases was a $56.6 million reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges. The Company's first quarter of 2003 employee benefits costs were higher than prior quarters partially due to a change in the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets in the third quarter of 2002 and, again, in the first quarter of 2003. The Company utilized a long-term rate of
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 11 return of 11.9 percent in the first six months of 2002 and 9.9 percent in the second six months of 2002. The long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was lowered to 8.9 percent for 2003. These changes, among other pension assumptions, resulted in an incremental expense of approximately $15 million over the first quarter of 2002 and approximately $5 million over the fourth quarter of 2002. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2003 was lower than the fourth quarter of 2002 by $89.7 million (5.4 percent). The favorable variance was primarily due to a decrease in merger and restructuring-related charges of $90.3 million (83.7 percent) from the fourth quarter of 2002 and a decline in other expense of $98.3 million (24.6 percent), primarily due to lower marketing and public relations, legal, and travel expenses and the impact of a $50.0 million litigation charge, including investment banking regulatory matters at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, that was taken in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, an incremental $31.4 million charge, primarily personnel-related, for rationalizing the Company's post-integration technology was taken in the fourth quarter of 2002 and contributed to the favorable variance in expense quarter-over-quarter. Partially offsetting these favorable variances were an increase in MSR impairment of $66.8 million and the impact of acquisitions, which added $32.0 million of expense for the quarter.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 12 Credit Quality The allowance for credit losses was $2,408.5 million at March 31, 2003, compared with the allowance for credit losses of $2,422.0 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 194 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 196 percent at December 31, 2002. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.06 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 2.08 percent at December 31, 2002. Total net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2003 were $333.8 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $378.5 million and the first quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $335.0 million.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 13 Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $164.8 million for the first quarter of 2003, or .98 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $207.5 million, or 1.19 percent of average loans outstanding, in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $163.3 million, or .94 percent of average loans outstanding, in the first quarter of 2002. Included in the fourth quarter of 2002 total commercial loan net charge-offs was a $36 million charge-off of a leveraged lease to a single U.S. airline entering bankruptcy. Retail loan net charge-offs of $163.1 million in the first quarter of 2003 were lower than the fourth quarter of 2002 by $1.3 million (.8 percent) and $5.9 million (3.5 percent) lower than the first quarter of 2002. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were 1.75 percent in the first quarter of 2003, compared with 1.74 percent and 1.95 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 and first quarter of 2002, respectively. Lower levels of retail loan net charges-offs principally reflected the Company's improvement in ongoing collection efforts and risk management as a result of the successful completion of the integration process.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 14 The level of net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2003 reflected current economic conditions and weakness in the communications, transportation and manufacturing sectors, as well as the impact of the economy on highly leveraged enterprise value financings. Assuming no further deterioration in the economy, however, the Company expects net charge-offs to trend lower.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 15 Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2003, totaled $1,362.6 million, compared with $1,373.5 million at December 31, 2002, and $1,110.8 million at March 31, 2002. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 1.16 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 1.18 percent at December 31, 2002, and ..97 percent at March 31, 2002. Assuming no further deterioration in the economy, the Company expects nonperforming assets to remain stable.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 16 Total shareholders' equity was $18.5 billion at March 31, 2003, compared with $15.9 billion at March 31, 2002. The increase was the result of corporate earnings offset by dividends and share buybacks. Tangible common equity to assets was 5.8 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 5.6 percent at December 31, 2002, and 5.8 percent at March 31, 2002. The tier 1 capital ratio was 8.0 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 7.8 percent at December 31, 2002, and 7.7 percent at March 31, 2002. The total risk-based capital ratio was 12.4 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 12.2 percent at December 31, 2002, and 12.4 percent at March 31, 2002. The leverage ratio was 7.4 percent at March 31, 2003, compared with 7.5 percent at December 31, 2002, and 7.6 percent at March 31, 2002. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of stated "well capitalized" requirements.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 17 On December 18, 2001, the board of directors of U.S. Bancorp approved an authorization to repurchase 100 million shares of outstanding common stock through 2003. There are approximately 91.5 million shares remaining to be repurchased under this authorization.
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 18 Lines of Business Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, Payment Services, Capital Markets, and Treasury and Corporate Support. Business line results are derived from the Company's business unit profitability reporting systems. Designations, assignments and allocations may change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. All results for 2002 have been restated to present consistent methodologies for all business lines. Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking's pre-provision contribution was $603.9 million in the first quarter of 2003, a 6.3 percent increase over the same period of 2002 and a 4.3 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in Wholesale Banking's first quarter 2003 pre-provision contribution over the first quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue (6.1 percent), partly offset by higher noninterest expense (5.1
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 19 percent). Total net revenue in the first quarter of 2003 was higher than the first quarter of 2002, with favorable variances in both net interest income (4.9 percent) and noninterest income (9.4 percent). The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a significant increase in average deposits (40.6 percent) and higher spreads, partially offset by a reduction in average loans outstanding. Wholesale Banking's favorable variance in noninterest income year-over-year was driven by higher cash management fees and other income, partially offset by lower commercial products revenue, which was primarily the result of lower loan conduit servicing fees. The increase in Wholesale Banking's pre-provision contribution in the first quarter of 2003 over the fourth quarter of 2002 was the result of favorable variances in both net revenue (3.5 percent) and noninterest expense (1.0 percent). Net revenue in the first quarter of 2003 was higher than the previous quarter primarily due to an increase in cash management fees and a lease residual write-down taken in the fourth quarter of 2002. Consumer Banking delivers products and services to the broad consumer market and small businesses through banking offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and automated teller machines ("ATMs"). It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, small business banking, consumer lending, mortgage banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking, and investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking's pre-provision contribution was $712.3 million in the first quarter of 2003, a 12.5 percent increase over the same period of 2002 and a .3 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in Consumer Banking's first quarter 2003 pre-provision contribution over the first quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue (20.9 percent), partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense (32.6 percent). Net interest income improved year-over-year by $66.9 million (8.5 percent), the result of an increase in retail loans, higher spreads and acquisitions. The growth in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in gains on the sale of securities, mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges. The Consumer Banking group also posted increases in investment products fees and commissions (9.7 percent). The $105.8 million of gains on the sale of securities recognized by the business line in the first quarter of 2003 represent an economic hedge to a portion of the MSR impairment of $120.9 million caused by declining interest rates. The increase in mortgage banking revenue can be attributed to higher mortgage loan servicing, originations and sales and the acquisition of Leader. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2003 was higher than the first quarter of 2002 (32.6 percent), primarily due to the increase in MSR
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 20 impairment and the impact of acquisitions. The improvement in Consumer Banking's pre-provision contribution in the first quarter of 2003 over the fourth quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue (4.1 percent), partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense (8.9 percent). The Consumer Banking business line benefited overall from strong mortgage banking results in the current quarter. Due to the increase in activity, mortgage banking's pre-provision contribution increased by $28.6 million and $12.5 million over the first quarter of 2002 and fourth quarter of 2002, respectively. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management provides mutual fund processing services, trust, private banking and financial advisory services through four businesses, including: the Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Institutional Trust and Custody, and Fund Services, LLC. The business segment also offers investment management services to several client segments including mutual funds, institutional customers, and private asset management. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management's pre-provision contribution was $183.6 million in the first quarter of 2003, 1.2 percent higher than the same period of 2002 and 3.1 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2002. The favorable variance in the business line's pre-provision contribution in the first quarter of 2003 over the first quarter of 2002, was the result of a favorable variance in net revenue of $14.7 million (4.9 percent) and an unfavorable variance in noninterest expense of $12.6 million (10.5 percent). The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust, which added approximately $23.9 million of net revenue in the first quarter of 2003, offset by lower equity market valuations for assets under management given equity capital market conditions. The unfavorable variance in expense was, also, primarily due to the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust. The $5.6 million (3.1 percent) increase in the business line's pre-provision contribution in the first quarter of 2003 over the fourth quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue (8.7 percent), partially offset by higher noninterest expense (17.4 percent). The increase in both net revenue and noninterest expense was primarily driven by the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust. Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing, merchant processing, and debit cards. Payment Services' pre-provision contribution was $375.1 million in the first quarter of 2003, a 12.5 percent increase over the same period of 2002 and a 16.1 percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in Payment Services' pre-provision contribution in the first quarter
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 21 of 2003 over the first quarter of 2002 was the result of higher net revenue (5.0 percent) and lower noninterest expense (7.5 percent). The growth in net revenue year-over-year was primarily due to growth in credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and ATM processing services (15.9 percent), offset by a decrease in merchant processing revenue (4.7 percent). Noninterest expense decreased by $15.1 million (7.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2003 from the first quarter of 2002, primarily due to reduced fraud losses, third party merchant processing costs and marketing expense. The decrease in Payment Services' pre-provision contribution in the first quarter of 2003 from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower net revenue (13.1 percent), the result of a credit card portfolio sale in the fourth quarter and seasonally lower processing revenues in the first quarter, partially offset by lower noninterest expense (6.4 percent). The reduction in noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was driven by lower intangible amortization, fraud losses and marketing expense. Capital Markets engages in equity and fixed income trading activities, offers investment banking and underwriting services for corporate and public sector customers and provides financial advisory services and securities, mutual funds, annuities and insurance products to consumers and regionally based businesses through a network of brokerage offices. Capital Markets' pre-provision contribution was $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with a pre-provision contribution of $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2002 and a pre-provision loss of $36.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Pre-provision contribution was lower in the first quarter of 2003 than the same quarter of 2002, primarily due to lower net revenue (4.8 percent), driven by reductions in investment products fees and commissions and investment banking revenues, partially offset by an increase in trading account profits and commissions and higher other income. The increase in Capital Markets' pre-provision contribution in the first quarter of 2003 over the previous quarter was primarily the result of a $50.0 million litigation charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2002. Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances, and the change in residual allocations associated with the provision for credit losses. It also includes business activities managed on a corporate basis, including enterprise-wide operations and administrative support functions. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded a pre-provision loss of $131.9 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with pre-provision losses of $97.7 million in the first quarter of 2002 and $107.9 million
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2003 Results April 15, 2003 Page 22 in the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in the pre-provision loss year-over-year was the result of a $38.7 million increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in net revenue. The increase in net revenue over the first quarter of 2002 was primarily due to higher net interest income (9.8 percent), driven by the investment securities portfolio. The unfavorable variance in noninterest expense year-over-year was principally due to employee benefits, including pension costs, affordable housing and bank-wide communication expense. The increase in the business line's pre-provision loss in the first quarter of 2003 from the fourth quarter of 2002 was the result of unfavorable variances in net revenue (7.4 percent) and noninterest expense (1.2 percent). The change in net revenue was due to the net effect of higher net interest income (22.0 percent), offset by a reduction in gains from the sale of securities.
