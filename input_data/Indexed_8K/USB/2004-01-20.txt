     99.1 Press Release issued by U.S. Bancorp on January 20, 2004.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
     DATE: January 20, 2004

 
     (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $977.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $819.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income of $.50 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003 was higher than the same period of 2002 by $.07 (16.3 percent). Return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.05 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with returns of 1.83 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2003 included after-tax merger and restructuring-related items of ($5.0)

million, which had an immaterial impact on earnings per share, compared with ($69.9) million, or ($.03) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002.
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "2003 concluded a 5-year period dominated by transformational acquisitions and their resulting integration activities. Due to the dedication and support of our exceptional employees, we now have a company that is uniquely positioned to achieve consistent earnings growth as a result of our balanced business mix, advantaged scale, reduced risk profile, low-cost leadership position and emphasis on customer service.
     "Specific to 2003, we achieved our earnings objectives, despite the soft economy, increasing net income by 17.8 percent while producing industry-leading returns on assets and equity of 1.99 percent and 19.2 percent, respectively. In addition, we completed the spin-off of Piper Jaffray to our shareholders, a company with a market value of approximately $880 million, increased our cash dividend twice during the year resulting in a increase of 23.1 percent from the rate paid in the fourth quarter of 2002 and announced our intention to return 80 percent of earnings to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases.
     "Looking forward to 2004, we see business conditions improving, as evidenced by the significant improvements we saw in the fourth quarter of 2003 in credit quality, as well as improving trends in our fiduciary and payments businesses. In this improving environment, we intend to achieve our stated long-term earnings per share growth goal of 10 percent, while continuing to make the investments that are necessary to ensure top line growth.
     "In closing, I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and commitment in making 2003 a year of significant progress. Their focus on service quality, expanding existing customer relationships and acquiring new customer relationships was apparent in 2003 and will be critical to achieving our objectives in the future."
     The Company's results for the fourth quarter of 2003 improved over the same period of 2002, primarily due to growth in net interest income and fee based products and services, as well as controlled operating expense and lower credit costs. Net income from continuing operations was $970.3 million, or $.50 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $858.6 million, or $.45 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2002, representing an 11.1 percent annual growth rate.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 3  
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $37.7 million (1.2 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2002, which primarily reflected the net reduction in securities gains (losses) of $106.3 million, in addition to an unfavorable variance in commercial products revenue and lower year-over-year gains from the sale of assets. Otherwise, favorable revenue growth occurred in net interest income, payment systems revenue, cash management fees, trust and investment management fees, and mortgage banking revenue. Acquisitions, including the 57 branches of Bay View Bank in California and the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street Corporate Trust"), contributed approximately $33.0 million of additional net revenue year-over-year.
     Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 was lower than the fourth quarter of 2002 by $144.2 million (9.7 percent), primarily reflecting a $99.7 million reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges, a $54.1 million favorable change in the recognition of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") impairment and cost savings from completed merger and restructuring-related activities. These positive variances were partially offset by expense increases due to acquisitions, which accounted for approximately $16.0 million of expense growth year-over-year.
     Provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $286.0 million, a decrease of $63.0 million (18.1 percent) from the fourth quarter of 2002. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $285.1 million, compared with the third quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $309.9 million and the fourth quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $378.5 million. The decline in losses from a year ago was primarily the result of an improving credit risk profile and collection efforts. Total nonperforming assets declined to $1,148.1 million at December 31, 2003, from $1,318.3 million at September 30, 2003 (12.9 percent), and $1,373.5 million at December 31, 2002 (16.4 percent). The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 232 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 202 percent at September 30, 2003, and 196 percent at December 31, 2002.
     On December 31, 2003, the Company announced that it had completed the spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies (NYSE: PJC). The Company distributed one share of Piper Jaffray Companies common stock for every 100 shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock held by shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m., EST, on December 22, 2003, by means of a special dividend. In connection with the spin-off, accounting rules require that the financial statements be restated for all prior periods. As such, historical financial results related to Piper Jaffray have been segregated and accounted for
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 4  
in the Company's financial statements as discontinued operations. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2003 included after-tax income from the discontinued operations of Piper Jaffray Companies of $6.7 million, which had an immaterial impact on diluted earnings per share. This compared with an after-tax loss of ($38.9) million, or ($.02) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. For the full year 2003, net income included after-tax income from discontinued operations of $22.5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with an after-tax loss of ($22.7) million, or ($.01) per diluted share, for the full year 2002.
     Effective January 8, 2004, the Company elected to adopt the "fair value" method of accounting for stock-based compensation. This resulted in the Company recognizing compensation expense for the estimated fair value of all employee stock options granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The company has implemented this accounting change utilizing the "retroactive restatement method," which requires all financial statement periods to be restated for all stock-based compensation. Consequently, the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003, full year 2003 and all respective prior periods have been restated to reflect this change in accounting. The impact of this change on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fourth quarter of 2003 and fourth quarter of 2002 was ($.02) and ($.01), respectively. In addition, the impact on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for full year 2003 and 2002 was ($.06) and ($.05), respectively, due to this change. The impact of this change on diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 was ($.01) and ($.02), respectively, and ($.06) per diluted share for both full year 2003 and 2002.

Net Interest Income
     Fourth quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,816.7 million, compared with $1,765.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002. Average earning assets for the period increased over the fourth quarter of 2002 by $12.6 billion (8.3 percent), primarily driven by increases in investment securities, residential mortgages, and retail loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans and loans held for sale related to mortgage banking activities. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2003 was 4.42 percent, compared with 4.43 percent in the third quarter of 2003 and 4.65 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the fourth quarter of 2002 primarily reflected growth in lower-yielding investment securities as a percent of total earning assets, a change in loan mix, and
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 6  
a decline in the margin benefit from net free funds due to lower interest rates. In addition, the net interest margin declined year-over-year as a result of consolidating loans from Stellar Funding Group, Inc., a commercial loan conduit, onto the Company's balance sheet during the third quarter of 2003. The slight decline in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the third quarter of 2003 also reflected a similar change in earning asset mix.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 7  
     Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $3.9 billion (3.4 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to growth in average residential mortgages of $4.4 billion (49.2 percent) and retail loans of $1.1 billion (2.9 percent) year-over-year. Total commercial loans declined by $2.3 billion (5.3 percent), while total commercial real estate loans increased by $647 million (2.4 percent). Although the consolidation of loans from the Stellar commercial loan conduit had a positive impact on average loan balances year-over-year, current credit markets and soft economic conditions throughout much of 2003 led to the overall decrease in total commercial loans. Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2003 were lower than the third quarter of 2003 by $682 million (.6 percent), reflecting reductions in commercial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by growth in both residential mortgages and retail loans.
     Average investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $10.4 billion (34.1 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2002, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from loan sales, declines in commercial loan balances and additional deposits assumed in connection with the Bay

View Bank branch acquisition. Investment securities at December 31, 2003, were $14.8 billion higher than at December 31, 2002, and $8.3 billion higher than the balance at September 30, 2003. The increase from the third quarter primarily reflects the timing of securities sales late in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company continued to acquire floating-rate securities and shorter-term fixed-rate securities as part of its asset/liability management activities.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits in the fourth quarter of 2003 were lower than the fourth quarter of 2002 by $1.6 billion (5.0 percent). The change is primarily due to lower mortgage banking activities and a decline in Federal government deposits related to their decision in the third quarter to pay for treasury management services rather than maintain compensating balances. Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $6.8 billion (8.6 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2002. Approximately $1.7 billion of the increase in average interest-bearing deposits was due to acquisitions, while the remaining $5.1 billion of growth was driven by increases in savings products balances, partially offset by decreases in time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and time deposits greater than $100,000.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $2.3 billion (7.1 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2003 due to lower government-related deposits, while average interest-bearing deposits were slightly higher (.7 percent). Noninterest-bearing deposits at
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 9  
December 31, 2003, were essentially flat compared to September 30, 2003, and $2.6 billion (7.5 percent) lower than at December 31, 2002.
Noninterest Income
     Fourth quarter noninterest income was $1,296.6 million, a decrease of $89.1 million (6.4 percent) from the same quarter of 2002, and a $119.2 million (10.1 percent) increase over the third quarter of 2003. The decline in noninterest income from the fourth quarter of 2002 was driven by a net reduction in gains (losses) on the sale of securities, other income and commercial products revenue, partially offset by increases in payment services revenue, cash management fees, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking revenue, and the effects of acquisitions, including the branches of Bay View Bank and State Street Corporate Trust, which contributed approximately $24.3 million in additional noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2003. Credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue were higher in the fourth quarter of 2003 than the fourth quarter of 2002 by $9.7 million (6.8 percent) and $8.3 million (10.3 percent), respectively. Although credit and debit card revenue grew year-over-year, the growth was somewhat muted due to the impact of the settlement of the antitrust litigation brought against VISA USA and Mastercard
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 10  
by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co. and other retailers, which lowered the interchange rate on signature debit transactions beginning August 1, 2003. The year-over-year impact of the VISA settlement on credit and debit card revenue was approximately $12.6 million. This change in the interchange rate, in addition to higher customer loyalty rewards expenses, however, were more than offset by increases in transaction volumes and other rate adjustments. The corporate payment products revenue growth reflected growth in sales and card usage. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in the fourth quarter of 2003 than the same quarter of 2002 by $4.0 million (2.8 percent), due to an increase in transaction volume, which was partially offset by lower processing spreads resulting from changes in the mix of merchants. The favorable variance in trust and investment management fees of $33.0 million (15.4 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2003 over the same period of 2002 was principally driven by the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust, which contributed approximately $21.1 million in fees during the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, trust and investment management fees benefited from higher equity market valuations and account growth year-over-year. Cash management fees grew by $13.7 million (13.4 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2003 over the same period of 2002. The increase in cash management fees year-over-year was primarily driven by a change during the third quarter of 2003 in the Federal government's payment methodology for treasury management services from compensating balances, reflected in net interest income, to fees. Mortgage banking revenue increased by $3.5 million (4.0 percent) over the same period of 2002 due to higher loan servicing revenue, which was slightly offset by a decline in origination and sales revenue. Offsetting these favorable variances were declines in other income and commercial products revenue year-over-year. Other income declined primarily due to a $46.5 million gain on the sale of a co-branded credit card portfolio recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002. Commercial products revenue declined by $9.8 million (9.0 percent) year-over-year, principally reflecting lower commercial loan conduit servicing fees, which resulted, in part, from unwinding the Stellar commercial loan conduit.
     Noninterest income increased in the fourth quarter of 2003 by $119.2 million (10.1 percent) over the third quarter of 2003, primarily due to the net favorable change in gains (losses) on the sale of securities of $108.8 million and increases in credit and debit card revenue and trust and investment management fees. These favorable variances were partially offset by lower corporate payment product fees and cash management fees. Credit and debit card revenue in the fourth quarter was seasonally higher than the third quarter of 2003. The VISA USA settlement had a
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 11  
slight negative impact of $4.9 million, as the reduced interchange rates became effective August 1, 2003. Trust and investment management fees increased by $6.8 million (2.8 percent) over the third quarter of 2003 due to the impact of improving equity market valuations, annual fees and core account growth. Corporate payment products fees were seasonally lower than the third quarter of 2003, primarily due to the government purchasing card sales volumes, while cash management fees declined from the prior quarter due to lower fees from government-related sources.
Noninterest Expense
     Fourth quarter noninterest expense totaled $1,342.4 million, a decrease of $144.2 million (9.7 percent) from the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline in expense year-over-year was primarily due to a $99.7 million reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges, the favorable change in MSR impairment of $54.1 million and cost savings from merger and restructuring-related activities. These positive variances were partially offset by the impact of recent acquisitions, including the branches of Bay View Bank and State Street Corporate Trust. The acquisitions contributed approximately $16.0 million of expense growth to the quarter.
     Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 was higher than the third quarter of 2003 by $89.1 million (7.1 percent). The unfavorable variance was primarily due to the MSR repairment ($108.5 million) taken in the third quarter of 2003. No expense was recorded in the fourth quarter
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 12  
of 2003 related to changes in MSR valuations. Partially offsetting this negative variance was other expense, which was $21.7 million (5.9 percent) lower than the prior quarter, primarily reflecting a decline in tax-related liabilities and merchant processing expenses.

Credit Quality
     The allowance for credit losses was $2,368.6 million at December 31, 2003, compared with the allowance for credit losses of $2,367.7 million at September 30, 2003, and $2,422.0 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 232 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 202 percent at September 30, 2003, and 196 percent at December 31, 2002. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.00
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 14  
percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 1.98 percent at September 30, 2003, and 2.08 percent at December 31, 2002. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $285.1 million, compared with the third quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $309.9 million and the fourth quarter of 2002 net charge-offs of $378.5 million.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $128.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, or .76 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $153.6 million, or .88 percent of average loans outstanding, in the third quarter of 2003 and $207.5 million, or 1.19 percent of average loans outstanding, in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline in net charge-offs was broad-based across most industries within the commercial loan portfolio.
     Retail loan net charge-offs of $149.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 were essentially flat to the third quarter of 2003 and $15.2 million (9.2 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2002. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were 1.53 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with 1.54 percent and 1.74 percent in the third quarter of 2003 and fourth quarter of 2002, respectively. Lower levels of retail loan net charges-offs principally reflected the Company's improvement in ongoing collection efforts and risk management.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 15  
     The overall level of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2003 continued to reflect current economic conditions. Due to the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the organization, net charge-offs are expected to continue to trend lower.

     Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2003, totaled $1,148.1 million, compared with $1,318.3 million at September 30, 2003, and $1,373.5 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was .97 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 1.10 percent at September 30, 2003, and 1.18 percent at December 31, 2002. Given the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the organization, nonperforming assets are expected to continue to trend lower.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 17  
     Total shareholders' equity was $19.2 billion at December 31 2003, compared with $18.4 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase was the result of corporate earnings offset primarily by dividends, including the special dividend of $685 million related to the spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies.
     Tangible common equity to assets was 6.5 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 6.6 percent at September 30, 2003, and 5.7 percent at December 31, 2002. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.2 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 9.0 percent at September 30, 2003, and 8.0 percent at December 31, 2002. The total risk-based capital ratio was 13.6 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 13.5 percent at September 30, 2003, and 12.4 percent at December 31, 2002. The leverage ratio was 8.0 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 8.0 percent at September 30, 2003, and 7.7 percent at December 31, 2002. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of stated "well capitalized" requirements.

On December 16, 2003, the board of directors of U.S. Bancorp approved an authorization to repurchase 150 million shares of outstanding common stock over the next 24 months. This repurchase program replaced the Company's previous program, which was set to expire in December 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased 15.0 million shares of common stock in both open market and privately negotiated transactions under these authorizations. As of December 31, 2003, there were approximately 142 million shares remaining to be repurchased under the current authorization.

Lines of Business
     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. Business line results are derived from the Company's business unit profitability reporting systems. Designations, assignments and allocations may change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. During 2003, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, results for 2003 and 2002 have been restated and presented on a comparable basis.
     Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking contributed $307.2 million of the Company's operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003, a 17.2 percent increase over the same period of 2002, but slightly less than the third quarter of 2003. The increase in Wholesale Banking's fourth quarter 2003 contribution over the fourth quarter of
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 20  
2002 was the result of essentially flat net revenue, lower noninterest expense (8.4 percent), and a favorable variance in the provision for credit losses (45.6 percent). Total net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003 was essentially flat to the fourth quarter of 2002, the net effect of an unfavorable variance in net interest income (1.3 percent) and higher noninterest income (3.8 percent). The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to declines in average total loans outstanding (3.7 percent), partially offset by increases in average total deposits (20.4 percent). Higher cash management fees (20.0 percent) primarily drove Wholesale Banking's favorable variance in noninterest income year-over-year. The increase in cash management fees was principally driven by a change during the third quarter of 2003 in the Federal government's payment methodology for treasury management services from compensating balances to fees. Wholesale Banking's favorable variance in noninterest expense year-over-year was driven by a decrease in other expense, the result of lower loan workout-related expense relative to the fourth quarter of 2002. The slight decrease in Wholesale Banking's contribution to operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the third quarter of 2003 was the net result of an unfavorable variance in net revenue (3.7 percent) and higher noninterest expense (6.2 percent), offset by a favorable reduction in the provision for credit losses (26.8 percent). Net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003 was lower than the previous quarter due to decreases in both net interest income (3.1 percent) and noninterest income (5.1 percent). The change in net interest income reflected reductions from the prior quarter in the business line's average loans outstanding and average deposits, while declines in cash management fees and commercial products revenue led to the unfavorable variance in noninterest income quarter to quarter. The increase in noninterest expense was principally due to higher legal and professional expenses. Lower net charge-offs from improving credit quality drove the favorable variance in provision for credit losses.
     Consumer Banking delivers products and services to the broad consumer market and small businesses through banking offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and automated teller machines ("ATMs"). It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, small business banking, consumer lending, mortgage banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking, and investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking contributed $419.8 million of the Company's operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003, a 7.5 percent increase over the same period of 2002, but a 4.8 percent decline from the third quarter of 2003. The increase in Consumer Banking's fourth quarter 2003 contribution over the fourth quarter of 2002
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 Results January 20, 2004 Page 21  
was the result of lower noninterest expense (7.6 percent) and provision for credit losses (16.5 percent), partially offset by an unfavorable variance in net revenue (1.3 percent). Net interest income improved year-over-year (1.8 percent), the result of increases in average loans and average deposits, as well as the acquisition of the Bay View Bank branches in California. Noninterest income also improved in the fourth quarter of 2003 over the same period of 2002, primarily due to positive changes in mortgage banking revenue and investment products fees and commissions. Offsetting the favorable variances in net interest income and noninterest income was a net reduction in gains (losses) on the sale of securities of $38.3 million. Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 was lower than the fourth quarter of 2002 (7.6 percent), mainly due to the change in MSR valuation, partly offset by the impact of the acquisition of the Bay View Bank branches. The decline in Consumer Banking's contribution in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the third quarter of 2003 was primarily the result of a decrease in net interest income (2.7 percent). Variances in noninterest income and noninterest expense were largely offsetting due to the change in MSR valuation and the net reduction in gains (losses) on sale of securities, respectively, quarter to quarter.
     Private Client, Trust and Asset Management provides trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund processing services through five businesses: Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Asset Management, Institutional Trust and Custody, and Custody and Fund Services, LLC. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed $134.5 million of the Company's operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003, 20.8 percent higher than the same period of 2002 and 3.6 percent higher than the third quarter of 2003. The favorable variance in the business line's contribution in the fourth quarter of 2003 over the fourth quarter of 2002 was the result of a favorable variance in net revenue (18.4 percent), partly offset by an unfavorable variance in noninterest expense of (16.9 percent). The increase in net revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust, which added approximately $30.5 million of net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003, and increases due to higher equity market valuations and core account growth. Higher total deposit balances (48.2 percent) favorably impacted net interest income year-over-year. The unfavorable variance in expense was, also, primarily due to the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust, partly offset by business line cost savings year-over-year. The increase in the business line's contribution (3.6 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2003 over the prior quarter of 2003 was the result of higher net revenue (1.4 percent),

lower noninterest expense (1.0 percent) and a $1.3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses. The increase in net interest income from the third quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2003 was primarily driven by an increase in average total deposits (4.7 percent), while noninterest income benefited from higher equity market valuations, annual fees and core customer growth.
     Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing, merchant processing, and debit cards. Payment Services contributed $196.6 million of the Company's operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003, an 8.2 percent decrease from the same period of 2002, but a 4.0 percent increase over the third quarter of 2003. The decline in Payment Services' contribution in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the same period of 2002 was the result of lower net revenue (7.2 percent), partially offset by a decline in noninterest expense (5.8 percent) and a lower provision for credit losses (6.3 percent). The reduction in net revenue year-over-year was primarily due to lower net interest income (12.2 percent), which reflected lower spreads on retail credit cards and a reduction in loan fees relative to the prior year's quarter, in addition to a reduction in other revenue. Other revenue decreased due to gains of $46.5 million on the sale of a co-branded credit card loan portfolio that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2002. Partially offsetting these declines were growth in credit and debit card revenue (6.7 percent), corporate payment products revenue (10.3 percent) and merchant processing services revenue (2.8 percent). Although credit and debit card revenue was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2003 by the VISA debit card settlement and higher customer loyalty rewards expenses, increases in transaction volumes and other rate adjustments more than offset these detrimental changes. Noninterest expense declined (5.8 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the fourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to savings from the completion of systems integration activity. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the fourth quarter of 2003 over the previous quarter was primarily due to seasonally higher net revenue from retail credit and debit card products, partially offset by seasonally lower corporate payment products revenue and higher provision for credit losses.
     Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances and business activities managed on a corporate basis, including enterprise-wide operations and administrative support functions. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded an operating loss of ($82.8) million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with

operating losses of ($49.6) million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and ($120.9) million in the third quarter of 2003. The increase in the loss year-over-year was largely the result of a decrease in net revenue (10.6 percent) and a $29.6 million increase in provision for credit losses relative to the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline in net revenue from the fourth quarter of 2002 was primarily due to a net reduction in gains (losses) on the sale of securities. The decrease in the business line's loss in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the third quarter of 2003 was the result of favorable variances in net revenue (18.5 percent) and noninterest expense (5.0 percent).
