     99.1 Press Release issued by U.S. Bancorp on April 20, 2004.
ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On April 20, 2004, U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") issued a press release discussing first quarter 2004 results. The press release is included as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company and includes a cautionary statement identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
     DATE: April 20, 2004

 
(NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $1,008.4 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared with $884.8 million for the first quarter of 2003. Net income of $.52 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2004 was higher than the same period of 2003 by $.06 (13.0 percent). Return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.14 percent and 20.7 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2004, compared with returns of 1.95 percent and 19.1 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2003.
     MINNEAPOLIS, April 20, 2004  U.S. Bancorp
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "Our Company's first quarter results, highlighted by achieving record net income of $1 billion, demonstrate that we are well on our way toward reaching our financial goals for 2004. We expect our industry-leading return on average assets and return on average equity of 2.14 percent and 20.7 percent, respectively, to show modest improvement as the year progresses. We had continued improvement in our credit quality, growth in our fee based businesses and improvement in our overall operating efficiency. During the first quarter, we continued to benefit from growth in both
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 2
consumer deposit accounts and loans, and we began to see signs of growth in commercial loans. As the economy improves, we are optimistic that this segment will become even stronger.
     "With all integration activity completed and credit quality issues abating, we are now focused on generating revenue growth. We remain committed to growing revenue faster than expense, achieving industry leading performance metrics, reaching the top quartile in credit quality, sustaining industry leading capital generation, and returning 80% of our earnings to shareholders; all while providing exceptional customer service. We have the people, the products and services, the advanced technology, the low-cost provider leadership position and the commitment to customer service we need to continue to build and grow this franchise. I am looking forward to the rest of 2004 and what our Company can, and will, accomplish."
     The Company's results for the first quarter of 2004 improved over the same period of 2003, primarily due to growth in fee based products and services, as well as controlled operating expense and lower credit costs. Included in the current quarter was a $90.0 million reduction in income tax expense related to the resolution of federal tax examinations covering substantially all of the Company's legal entities for the years 1995 through 1999. The first quarter of 2004 also included the recognition of $109.3 million ($71.7 million on an after-tax basis) of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") impairment, driven by lower interest rates and related prepayments, and a $35.4 million expense ($23.2 million on an after-tax basis) associated with the prepayment of a portion of the Company's long term debt. The Company took no securities gains in the quarter to offset MSR impairment.
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the first quarter of 2004 was $45.5 million (1.4 percent) lower than the first quarter of 2003, primarily reflecting a $140.7 million reduction in gains on the sale of securities. Favorable revenue growth in the majority of fee based products and services categories partially offset the reduction in securities gains.
     Total noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2004 was essentially flat to the first quarter of 2003, primarily reflecting a $17.6 million reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges, an $11.6 million favorable change in the recognition of MSR impairment and cost savings from completed integration activities. These positive variances were partially offset by expense increases in employee benefits, professional services, marketing and business development and other expense, the latter of which included a $35.4 million charge related to the debt prepayment.

     Provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2004 was $235.0 million, a decrease of $100.0 million (29.9 percent) from the first quarter of 2003. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2004 were $233.9 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $285.1 million and the first quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $333.8 million. The decline in losses from a year ago was primarily the result of an improving credit risk profile and collection efforts. Total nonperforming assets declined to $1,046.6 million at March 31, 2004, from $1,148.1 million at December 31, 2003 (8.8 percent), and $1,362.6 million at March 31, 2003 (23.2 percent). The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 258 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with 232 percent at December 31, 2003, and 194 percent at March 31, 2003.
     On December 31, 2003, the Company completed the spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies (NYSE: PJC). In connection with the spin-off, accounting rules require that the financial statements be restated for all prior periods. As such, historical financial results related to Piper Jaffray Companies have been segregated and accounted for in the Company's financial statements as discontinued operations. Net income in the first quarter of 2003 and fourth quarter of 2003 included after-tax income from the discontinued operations of Piper Jaffray Companies of $.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, which had an immaterial impact on diluted earnings per share.

Net Interest Income
     First quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,779.0 million, compared with $1,776.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2003. Average earning assets for the period increased over the first quarter of 2003 by $10.2 billion (6.6 percent), primarily driven by increases in investment securities, residential mortgages, and retail loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans and loans held for sale related to mortgage banking activities. The net interest margin in the first quarter of 2004 was 4.29 percent, compared with 4.42 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 4.59 percent in the first quarter of 2003. The decline in the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2004 from the first quarter of 2003 primarily reflected growth in lower-yielding investment securities as a percent of total earning assets, a change in loan mix, and a decline in the margin benefit from net free funds due to lower interest rates. In addition, the net interest margin declined year-over-year as a result of consolidating high credit quality, low margin
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 5
loans from Stellar Funding Group, Inc., a commercial loan conduit, onto the Company's balance sheet during the third quarter of 2003. The decline in the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2004 from the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected a similar change in earning asset mix.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 6
     Average loans for the first quarter of 2004 were $2.5 billion (2.1 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2003, primarily due to growth in average residential mortgages of $3.5 billion (34.4 percent) and retail loans of $1.7 billion (4.6 percent) year-over-year. Total commercial loans declined by $3.1 billion (7.4 percent), while total commercial real estate loans increased by $327 million (1.2 percent). Although the consolidation of loans from the Stellar commercial loan conduit had a positive impact on average loan balances year-over-year, soft economic conditions throughout much of 2003 led to the overall decrease in total commercial loans. Average loans for the first quarter of 2004 were lower than the fourth quarter of 2003 by $490 million (.4 percent), reflecting reductions in commercial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by growth in both residential mortgages and retail loans. While average commercial loans declined for the quarter, the Company's ending commercial loan balances increased by $480 million from December 31, 2003.
      Average investment securities in the first quarter of 2004 were $10.5 billion (30.8 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2003, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from declining
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 7
commercial loan balances and deposit growth from a year ago. Investment securities at March 31, 2004, were $15.0 billion higher than at March 31, 2003, and $2.1 billion higher than the balance at December 31, 2003. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company continued to acquire floating-rate securities and shorter-term fixed-rate securities as part of its asset/liability management activities.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the first quarter of 2004 were lower than the first quarter of 2003 by $3.8 billion (11.6 percent). The change was primarily due to lower deposits associated with mortgage banking activities and a decline in Federal government deposits related to their decision in the third quarter of 2003 to pay for treasury management services rather than maintain compensating balances. Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $4.0 billion (4.8 percent) over the first quarter of 2003, driven by increases in savings products balances, partially offset by decreases in time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and time deposits greater than $100,000.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the first quarter of 2004 were $622 million (2.1 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2003 due to lower deposits associated with mortgage banking activities and corporate banking. Average interest-bearing deposits were slightly higher than the fourth quarter of 2003 (.4 percent), primarily due to increases in time deposits greater than
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 8
$100,000, interest checking and savings accounts, partially offset by decreases in money market accounts and time certificates of deposit less than $100,000. Noninterest-bearing deposits at March 31, 2004, were lower than at March 31, 2003, by $3.4 billion (9.8 percent) and were $1.4 billion (4.3 percent) lower than at December 31, 2003.
Noninterest Income
     First quarter noninterest income was $1,318.3 million, a decrease of $47.8 million (3.5 percent) from the same quarter of 2003, and a $21.7 million (1.7 percent) increase over the fourth quarter of 2003. The decline in noninterest income in the first quarter of 2004 from the first quarter of 2003 was driven by a $140.7 million reduction in gains on the sale of securities, partially offset by increases in most other categories of noninterest income. Credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue were higher in the first quarter of 2004 than the first quarter of 2003 by $14.4 million (11.3 percent) and $8.8 million (10.2 percent), respectively. Although credit and debit card revenue grew year-over-year, the growth was somewhat muted due to the impact of the settlement of the antitrust litigation brought against VISA USA and Mastercard by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co. and other retailers, which lowered the interchange
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 9
rate on signature debit transactions beginning in August 2003. The year-over-year impact of the VISA settlement on credit and debit card revenue was approximately $8.2 million. This change in the interchange rate, in addition to higher customer loyalty rewards expenses, however, were more than offset by increases in transaction volumes and other rate adjustments. The corporate payment products revenue growth reflected growth in sales and card usage. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2004 than the same quarter of 2003 by $13.8 million (10.8 percent), reflecting an increase in transaction volume, partially offset by lower processing spreads due to a change in the mix of merchants. The favorable variance in trust and investment management fees of $20.0 million (8.7 percent) in the first quarter of 2004 over the same period of 2003 was principally driven by higher equity market valuations year-over-year. Deposit service charges were higher year-over-year by $22.0 million (13.5 percent) due to account growth and revenue enhancement initiatives. Treasury management fees grew by $5.5 million (4.9 percent) in the first quarter of 2004 over the same period of 2003. The increase in treasury management fees year-over-year was partially driven by a change during the third quarter of 2003 in the Federal government's payment methodology for treasury management services from compensating balances, reflected in net interest income, to fees. Commercial products revenue increased by $6.2 million (6.0 percent) over the first quarter of 2003 due to higher letter of credit, foreign exchange, syndication, and leasing fees, partially offset by a reduction in conduit servicing revenue. The $4.2 million (12.0 percent) increase in investment products fees and commissions reflected higher sales activity in the Consumer Banking business line. Offsetting these favorable variances were slight declines in mortgage banking revenue and other income year-over-year.
     Noninterest income increased in the first quarter of 2004 by $21.7 million (1.7 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2003, the net result of favorable variances in corporate payment products revenue, ATM processing services, trust and investment management fees, treasury management fees, commercial products revenue, mortgage banking revenue, investment products fees and commissions and other income, partially offset by seasonally lower credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing services. Corporate payment products revenue, ATM processing services, commercial products revenue, and investment products fees and commissions rose due to higher processing volumes and product sales. Mortgage banking revenue increased due to higher servicing fee income, partially offset by lower fees from originations and loan sales. Other income was higher by $11.0 million (11.9 percent), the net result of lower end of term lease residual losses
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 10
partially offset by a decrease in revenue from equity investments relative to the fourth quarter of 2003.
Noninterest Expense
     First quarter noninterest expense totaled $1,454.9 million, essentially flat to noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2003. Favorable variances in merger and restructuring-related charges of $17.6 million and other intangibles of $9.0 million (3.8 percent), along with general cost savings from completed integration activities were offset by increases in employee benefits, professional services, marketing and business development, postage, printing and supplies and other expense. Other expense in the first quarter of 2004 included a $35.4 million charge related to the prepayment of a portion of the Company's debt.
     Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2004 was higher than the fourth quarter of 2003 by $112.5 million (8.4 percent). The unfavorable variance from the fourth quarter of 2003 was primarily due to the recognition of $109.3 million of MSR impairment and a $35.4 million charge in other expense related to the prepayment of a portion of the Company's debt in the first quarter of 2004. The fourth quarter of 2003 did not include expense related to changes in MSR valuations. In addition, seasonally high payroll taxes contributed to the unfavorable variance in employee

benefits quarter-over-quarter. Partially offsetting these variances were reductions in all other expense categories, reflecting on-going expense management activities.

Credit Quality
     The allowance for credit losses was $2,369.7 million at March 31, 2004, compared with the allowance for credit losses of $2,368.6 million at December 31, 2003, and $2,408.5 million at March 31, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 1.98 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with 2.00 percent at December 31, 2003, and 2.06 percent at March
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 13
31, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 258 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with 232 percent at December 31, 2003, and 194 percent at March 31, 2003. Total net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2004 were $233.9 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $285.1 million and the first quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $333.8 million.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $84.2 million for the first quarter of 2004, or .52 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $128.7 million, or .76 percent of average loans outstanding, in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $164.8 million, or .98 percent of average loans outstanding, in the first quarter of 2003. The decline in net charge-offs was broad-based across most industries within the commercial loan portfolio.
     Retail loan net charge-offs of $142.4 million in the first quarter of 2004 were $6.8 million (4.6 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2003 and $20.7 million (12.7 percent) lower than the first quarter of 2003. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were 1.45 percent in the first quarter of 2004, compared with 1.53 percent and 1.75 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2003, respectively. Lower levels of retail loan net charges-offs principally reflected the Company's improvement in ongoing collection efforts and risk management.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 14
     The overall level of net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2004 reflected the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the organization. Net charge-offs are expected to continue to trend modestly lower.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 15
     Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2004, totaled $1,046.6 million, compared with $1,148.1 million at December 31, 2003, and $1,362.6 million at March 31, 2003. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was .87 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with .97 percent at December 31, 2003, and 1.16 percent at March 31, 2003. Given the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the organization, nonperforming assets are expected to continue to trend lower.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 16
     Total shareholders' equity was $19.5 billion at March 31, 2004, compared with $18.9 billion at March 31, 2003. The increase was the result of corporate earnings offset primarily by dividends, including the special dividend of $685 million related to the spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies, and share buybacks.
     Tangible common equity to assets was 6.4 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with 6.5 percent at December 31, 2003, and 6.0 percent at March 31, 2003. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.9 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with 9.1 percent at December 31, 2003, and 8.2 percent at March 31, 2003. The total risk-based capital ratio was 13.3 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with 13.6 percent at December 31, 2003, and 12.6 percent at March 31, 2003. The leverage ratio was 8.0 percent at March 31, 2004, compared with 8.0 percent at December 31, 2003, and 7.6 percent at March 31, 2003. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of stated "well capitalized" requirements.

On December 16, 2003, the board of directors of U.S. Bancorp approved an authorization to repurchase 150 million shares of outstanding common stock during the following 24 months. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased 33.8 million shares of common stock in both open market and privately negotiated transactions. As of March 31, 2004, there were approximately 108 million shares remaining to be repurchased under the current authorization.

Lines of Business
     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is available and is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Designations, assignments and allocations may change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. During 2004, a methodology change was made to allocate operational expenses incurred by Treasury and Corporate Support on behalf of the other major lines of business back to the appropriate operating segment. These allocations are identified as net shared services expense on the business lines' income statements. Accordingly, results for 2003 have been restated and presented on a comparable basis.
     Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports First Quarter 2004 Results April 20, 2004 Page 19
contributed $264.7 million of the Company's operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004, a 17.1 percent increase over the same period of 2003 and a 12.7 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in Wholesale Banking's first quarter 2004 contribution over the first quarter of 2003 was the result of favorable variances in total noninterest expense (5.5 percent) and the provision for credit losses (70.4 percent), partially offset by a decrease in total net revenue (4.6 percent). Total net revenue in the first quarter of 2004 was lower than in the first quarter of 2003, reflecting unfavorable variances in both net interest income (5.3 percent) and noninterest income (3.4 percent). The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to declines in average total loans outstanding (6.2 percent), partially offset by higher average total deposits (4.6 percent). Although treasury management fees were higher (9.7 percent) year-over-year, the growth was more than offset by unfavorable variances in commercial products revenue (5.9 percent), primarily conduit servicing fees, and other revenue. The increase in treasury management fees was principally driven by a change during the third quarter of 2003 in the Federal government's payment methodology for treasury management services from compensating balances to fees. Wholesale Banking's favorable variance in total noninterest expense year-over-year was driven by a decrease in other expense, the result of lower loan workout-related expense relative to the first quarter of 2003, partially offset by an increase in net shared services expense, which is primarily driven by customer transaction volume and account activities. The decrease in the provision for credit losses year-over-year was the result of a reduction in net charge-offs. The increase in Wholesale Banking's contribution to operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004 over the fourth quarter of 2003 was the net result of favorable variances in total noninterest expense (4.4 percent) and the provision for credit losses, partially offset by slightly lower total net revenue (.2 percent). Total net revenue in the first quarter of 2004 was lower than the previous quarter due to lower net interest income (2.8 percent) partially offset by growth in noninterest income (5.6 percent). The change in net interest income reflected reductions from the prior quarter in the business line's average loans outstanding and average deposits. The growth quarter-to-quarter in noninterest income was attributed to higher commercial products revenue, primarily syndication revenue, lease residual gains and letter of credit fees. The decrease in noninterest expense was principally due to lower loan-related expense. Lower net charge-offs from improving credit quality drove the favorable variance in provision for credit losses.

     Consumer Banking delivers products and services to the broad consumer market and small businesses through banking offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and automated teller machines ("ATMs"). It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, small business banking, including lending guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, small-ticket leasing, consumer lending, mortgage banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking, and investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking contributed $321.2 million of the Company's operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004, an 8.1 percent decrease from the same period of 2003 and a 12.6 percent decline from the fourth quarter of 2003. While the retail banking business segment grew net operating earnings by 18.6 percent and 8.5 percent over the first quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2003, respectively, the contribution of the mortgage banking business declined. The decrease in the mortgage banking business from the first quarter of 2003 was primarily the result of a reduction in gains on the sale of securities of $105.8 million that, generally, are utilized by the Company to offset impairment of mortgage servicing rights. In the first quarter of 2004, the Company elected not to sell higher yielding securities to offset MSR impairment within the mortgage banking business segment.
     For the Consumer Banking business, as a whole, the unfavorable variance in gains on the sale of securities was partially offset with favorable variances in net interest income (.4 percent), noninterest income (9.7 percent), total noninterest expense (2.2 percent) and the provision for credit losses (3.9 percent). Net interest income improved year-over-year (.4 percent), the result of increases in average loans and average core deposits, partially offset by a decline in the business line's net interest margin. Noninterest income also improved in the first quarter of 2004 over the same period of 2003, primarily due to growth in deposit service charges, investment products fees and commissions and other revenue. Other revenue was higher due to lower lease residual losses relative to the first quarter of 2003. Total noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2004 was lower than the first quarter of 2003 (2.2 percent), mainly due to favorable changes in net shared services expense and lower MSR impairment relative to 2003. A reduction in net charge-offs year-over-year drove the positive variance in the business line's provision for credit losses. The decline in Consumer Banking's contribution in the first quarter of 2004 from the fourth quarter of 2003 was primarily the result of the recognition of $109.3 million of MSR impairment in 2004. Offsetting this unfavorable variance were positive changes in total net revenue (1.0 percent), noninterest expense (3.8 percent) and the provision for credit losses (1.2 percent).

     Private Client, Trust and Asset Management provides trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund and alternative investment product services through five businesses: Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Asset Management, Institutional Trust, and Custody and Fund Services, LLC. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed $123.8 million of the Company's operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004, 26.3 percent higher than the same period of 2003 and 5.3 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2003. The favorable variance in the business line's contribution in the first quarter of 2004 over the first quarter of 2003 was the result of favorable variances in total net revenue (12.0 percent) and total noninterest expense (2.1 percent). Higher average total deposit balances (45.5 percent) favorably impacted net interest income year-over-year, while noninterest income benefited from higher asset management revenue due to improving equity market valuations. The favorable variance in expense was primarily due to business line cost savings year-over-year and slightly lower intangible amortization. The increase in the business line's contribution (5.3 percent) in the first quarter of 2004 over the fourth quarter of 2003 was the result of higher total net revenue (2.0 percent), lower total noninterest expense (1.4 percent) and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. The increase in net interest income from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2004 was primarily driven by an increase in average total deposits (8.2 percent), while noninterest income benefited from higher equity market valuations.
     Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing, merchant processing, and debit cards. Payment Services contributed $160.5 million of the Company's operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004, a 20.8 percent increase over the same period of 2003, but a 1.7 percent decrease over the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the first quarter of 2004 from the same period of 2003 was the result of higher total net revenue (5.2 percent) and a lower provision for credit losses (14.6 percent). The increase in total net revenue year-over-year was primarily due to growth in noninterest income (10.5 percent), partially offset by lower net interest income (7.1 percent), which reflected lower spreads on retail credit cards and a reduction in late fees relative to the prior year's quarter. The increase in noninterest income was principally the result of growth in credit and debit card revenue (11.1 percent), corporate payment products revenue (10.2 percent) and merchant processing services revenue (10.8 percent). Although credit and debit card revenue was negatively impacted in the first quarter of 2004 by the VISA debit card

settlement and higher customer loyalty rewards expense, increases in transaction volumes and other rate adjustments more than offset these detrimental changes. The decrease in Payment Services' contribution in the first quarter of 2004 from the fourth quarter of 2003 was primarily due to seasonally lower total net revenue (2.1 percent), offset by a reduction in the provision for credit losses, the result of a favorable change in net charge-offs.
     Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances and business activities managed on a corporate basis, including enterprise-wide operations and administrative support functions. Operational expenses incurred by Treasury and Corporate Support on behalf of the other business lines are allocated back primarily based on customer transaction volume and account activities to the appropriate business unit and are identified as net shared services expense. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded operating earnings of $138.2 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with operating earnings of $89.2 million in the first quarter of 2003 and $91.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in operating earnings in the current quarter over the first quarter of 2003 was largely the net result of a $90.0 million reduction in income tax expense related to the resolution of federal tax examinations for the years 1995 through 1999 and a $35.4 million charge associated with the prepayment of a portion of the Company's debt in the first quarter of 2004. In addition, revenue declined year-over-year due to a $35.8 million decrease in gains on the sale of securities. The favorable variance in operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004 over the fourth quarter of 2003 was principally the net result of the reduction in income tax expense and the charge associated with the prepayment of debt, as well as lower revenue from equity investments relative to the fourth quarter of 2003.
