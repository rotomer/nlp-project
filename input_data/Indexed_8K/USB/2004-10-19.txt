ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On October 19, 2004, U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") issued a press release discussing third quarter 2004 results. The press release is included as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company and includes a cautionary statement identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
(c) Exhibits.
     99.1 Press Release issued by U.S. Bancorp on October 19, 2004.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
     DATE: October 19, 2004

 
     (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $1,065.5 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $950.9 million for the third quarter of 2003. Net income of $.56 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2004 was higher than the same period of 2003 by $.07 (14.3 percent). Return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.21 percent and 21.9 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2004, compared with returns of 1.98 percent and 19.5 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2003.
MINNEAPOLIS, October 19, 2004  U.S. Bancorp
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "Our third quarter results represent the 7th consecutive quarter of record earnings for our Company. Our operating units continued to show strong momentum, driven by improved credit quality, moderate revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Aided by strong commercial loan recoveries, the net charge-off ratio fell to .53 percent in the quarter, while nonperforming assets declined by 11.7 percent from the balance at June 30, 2004. Excluding securities gains and losses, total net revenue in the third quarter increased by 3.4 percent over the same period of 2003, driven
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 2
by an 11.7 percent increase in fee-based products and services. Our payment services and consumer banking business lines led the way in fee revenue generation and continued to produce outstanding results, helping to offset weakness in commercial lending. We are continuing our investment in high-growth businesses through the expansion of our merchant acquiring business in Europe, the extension of our card issuing capabilities domestically and the roll out of our in-store branch initiative in consumer banking. Finally, we returned 94 percent of the Company's earnings in the quarter to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases."
     The Company's results for the third quarter of 2004 improved over the same period of 2003, primarily due to lower credit costs and growth in fee-based products and services. Included in the current quarter were gains on the sale of securities of $87.3 million, a net increase of $196.2 million over securities gains (losses) realized in the third quarter of 2003. The current quarter also included the recognition of $86.7 million of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") impairment, a $195.2 million unfavorable variance from the third quarter of 2003. Since the end of the second quarter of 2004, the yield on 10-year Treasury Notes decreased 46 basis points to 4.12 percent. The yield on 30-year Fannie Mae commitments declined 51 basis points during the same timeframe. Driven by the decrease in longer-term interest rates, the mortgage industry experienced an increase in refinancing activities, resulting in more prepayments.
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2004 was $302.8 million (10.1 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2003, primarily reflecting the $196.2 million net increase in gains (losses) on the sale of securities and growth in the majority of other fee-based revenue categories. The expansion of the Company's merchant acquiring business in Europe, including the purchase of the remaining 50 percent shareholder interest in EuroConex Technologies Ltd from the Bank of Ireland and the acquisition of two European merchant acquiring businesses, accounted for approximately $24 million of the favorable variance year-over-year.
     Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2004 was $265.7 million (21.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2003, primarily reflecting the $195.2 million unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. The expansion of the Company's merchant acquiring business in Europe accounted for approximately $29 million of the increase, including $6 million of business integration costs, while higher compensation, employee benefits, marketing and
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 3
business development, and technology and communication also contributed to the increase year-over-year.
     Provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2004 was $165.1 million, a decrease of $144.9 million (46.7 percent) from the third quarter of 2003. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2004 were $165.1 million, compared with the second quarter of 2004 net charge-offs of $204.5 million and the third quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $309.9 million. The decline in losses from a year ago was primarily the result of declining levels of nonperforming loans, collection efforts and higher commercial loan recoveries. Total nonperforming assets declined to $804.6 million at September 30, 2004, from $910.9 million at June 30, 2004 (11.7 percent), and $1,318.3 million at September 30, 2003 (39.0 percent). The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 337 percent at September 30, 2004, compared with 299 percent at June 30, 2004, and 202 percent at September 30, 2003.
     On December 31, 2003, the Company completed the spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies (NYSE: PJC). In connection with the spin-off, accounting rules require that the financial statements be restated for all prior periods. As such, historical financial results related to Piper Jaffray Companies have been segregated and accounted for in the Company's financial statements as discontinued operations. Net income in the third quarter of 2003 included after-tax income from the discontinued operations of Piper Jaffray Companies of $10.2 million, or $.01 per diluted share.

Net Interest Income
     Third quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,781.7 million, compared with $1,825.5 million recorded in the third quarter of 2003. Average earning assets for the period increased over the third quarter of 2003 by $4.3 billion (2.6 percent), primarily driven by increases in investment securities, retail loans and residential mortgages, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans and loans held for sale related to mortgage banking activities. The net interest margin in the third quarter of 2004 was 4.22 percent, compared with 4.28 percent in the second quarter of 2004 and 4.43 percent in the third quarter of 2003. The decline in the net interest margin in the third quarter of 2004 from the third quarter of 2003 primarily reflected a modest increase in the percent of total earnings assets funded by wholesale sources of funding and higher rates paid on wholesale funding due to the impact of rising rates.

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 6
     Average loans for the third quarter of 2004 were $2.9 billion (2.4 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2003, primarily due to growth in average retail loans of $3.5 billion (9.0 percent) and residential mortgages of $2.3 billion (19.1 percent) year-over-year. Total commercial loans declined by $2.7 billion (6.3 percent), while total commercial real estate loans decreased by $203 million (.7 percent). While economic conditions have improved somewhat from a year ago, excess liquidity and improving cash flows among corporate borrowers have led to the overall decrease in total commercial loans. Average loans for the third quarter of 2004 were higher than the second quarter of 2004 by $1.7 billion (1.4 percent), primarily reflecting growth in retail loans and residential mortgages.
     Average investment securities in the third quarter of 2004 were $4.7 billion (12.5 percent) higher than in the third quarter of 2003, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from declining commercial loan balances and loans held for sale. Investment securities at September 30, 2004, were $4.6 billion higher than at September 30, 2003, but $631 million lower than the balance at
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 7
June 30, 2004. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired principally floating and shorter-term fixed-rate securities and sold fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2004 were lower than the third quarter of 2003 by $2.1 billion (6.6 percent). Average branch-based noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2004, however, increased by $589 million (4.9 percent) over the same quarter of 2003, as net new checking account growth continued to gain momentum. This growth was more than offset, by reductions in average noninterest-bearing deposits in other areas, including national corporate banking, wholesale mortgage banking and government banking, as well as in mortgage-related escrow balances. Average total savings products declined year-over-year by $1.9 billion (3.1 percent). Average branch-based savings products deposits, which include interest checking, money market accounts and savings accounts, however, increased by $789 million (1.9 percent) over the same quarter of 2003. This positive variance in branch-based savings products deposits, was more than offset by reductions in other areas, including a $2.8 billion reduction in government-related deposits.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2004 were $816 million (2.7 percent) lower than the second quarter of 2004. Average branch-based noninterest-bearing deposits, however, increased by $206 million (1.6 percent) quarter-over-quarter. This growth was
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 8
more than offset by lower government banking deposits associated with the timing of tax filings, seasonally lower corporate trust deposits and a decline in mortgage banking-related deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits were also lower than the second quarter of 2004 (1.1 percent), primarily due to decreases in savings products, primarily driven by lower government banking deposits, as well as lower time certificates of deposit less than $100,000. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by an increase in time deposits greater than $100,000. Noninterest-bearing deposits at September 30, 2004, were lower than at September 30, 2003, by $856 million (2.6 percent) and $1.2 billion (3.7 percent) lower than at June 30, 2004.
Noninterest Income
     Third quarter noninterest income was $1,524.0 million, an increase of $346.6 million (29.4 percent) from the same quarter of 2003, and a $282.3 million (22.7 percent) increase over the second quarter of 2004. The increase in noninterest income over the third quarter of 2003 was driven by a net increase in gains (losses) on the sale of securities of $196.2 million, as well as favorable variances in the majority of fee income categories. Credit and debit card revenue and
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 9
corporate payment products revenue were higher in the third quarter of 2004 than the third quarter of 2003 by $26.7 million (19.4 percent) and $12.8 million (13.4 percent), respectively. Although credit and debit card revenue grew year-over-year, the growth was somewhat muted due to the impact of the settlement of the antitrust litigation brought against VISA USA and Mastercard by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co. and other retailers, which lowered the interchange rate on signature debit transactions beginning in August 2003. The year-over-year impact of the VISA settlement on credit and debit card revenue was approximately $7.8 million. This change in the interchange rate, in addition to higher customer loyalty rewards expenses, however, were more than offset by growth in transaction volumes and other rate changes. The corporate payment products revenue growth reflected growth in sales, card usage and rate changes. ATM processing services revenue was higher by $3.9 million (9.4 percent) in the third quarter of 2004 than the same quarter of the prior year due to increases in transaction volumes and sales. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in the third quarter of 2004 than the same quarter of 2003 by $41.2 million (28.2 percent), reflecting an increase in transaction volume, higher merchant and equipment fees and the recent expansion of the Company's merchant acquiring business in Europe. The recent European acquisitions accounted for approximately $26 million of the total increaseDeposit service charges were higher year-over-year by $20.4 million (10.9 percent) due to account growth, revenue enhancement initiatives and transaction-related fees. Commercial products revenue increased by $8.9 million (9.1 percent) over the third quarter of 2003, primarily due to leasing revenue. The favorable variance year-over-year in mortgage banking revenue of $7.7 million (8.6 percent) was primarily due to higher loan servicing revenue The $1.6 million (4.5 percent) increase in investment products fees and commissions reflected higher sales activity in the Consumer Banking business line. Other income was higher year-over-year by $35.1 million (39.2 percent), primarily due to a residual value insurance recovery during the third quarter of 2004 and a favorable change in retail lease residual gains (losses) relative to the same quarter of 2003Partially offsetting these positive variances were treasury management fees, which declined by $8.3 million (6.6 percent) in the third quarter of 2004 from the same period of 2003. The decrease in treasury management fees year-over-year was primarily due to higher fees received during the third quarter of 2003 specifically related to the change in the Federal government's payment methodology for treasury management services from compensating balances, reflected in net interest income, to fees.

     Noninterest income was higher in the third quarter of 2004 than the second quarter of 2004 by $282.3 million (22.7 percent), primarily due to a net increase in gains (losses) on the sale of securities of $259.0 million. Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and ATM processing services increased quarter-over-quarter by $5.5 million (3.5 percent), $5.8 million (5.6 percent) and $.3 million (.7 percent), respectively, driven by seasonally higher transaction volumes and sales. Merchant processing services revenue rose by $22.4 million (13.6 percent) over the second quarter of 2004 due to the expansion of the European merchant acquiring business, in addition to seasonality and higher same store sales. Deposit service charges were higher in the third quarter by $5.3 million (2.6 percent) than the second quarter, primarily due to an increase in transaction-related fees. Other income was $17.6 million (16.4 percent) higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a residual value insurance recovery during the third quarter. Trust and investment management fees were lower in the third quarter of 2004 than the second quarter of 2004 by $11.5 million (4.6 percent) partially due to the seasonality of second quarter tax preparation fees. Treasury management fees decreased by $3.6 million (3.0 percent) quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to lower federal tax receipts processing relative to the second quarter. Mortgage banking revenue was lower in the third quarter of 2004 than the second quarter of 2004 by $12.7 million (11.6 percent), primarily due to lower origination and sales revenue, partially offset by an increase in loan servicing revenue. Investment products fees and commissions declined by $5.1 million (12.1 percent) due to seasonally lower sales.

Noninterest Expense
     Third quarter noninterest expense totaled $1,519.0 million, an increase of $265.7 million (21.2 percent) from the same quarter of 2003 and a $286.4 million (23.2 percent) increase over the second quarter of 2004. The increase in expense year-over-year was primarily driven by the unfavorable change in MSR intangible valuations of $195.2 million and operating expenses related to the expansion of the Company's merchant acquiring business in Europe. The expense growth also reflected increases in compensation, employee benefits, marketing and business development, and technology and communications and certain business integration costs. Compensation expense was higher year-over-year due to an increase in salaries and performance-based incentives from a year ago. Employee benefits increased year-over-year by $24.2 million (31.9 percent), primarily as a result of a $14.7 million increase in pension expense and higher payroll taxes. Marketing and business development expense was higher by $12.0 million (24.7 percent), reflecting the increase and timing of marketing campaigns, while technology and communications expense rose by $7.7 million (7.5 percent), primarily due to outsourcing certain institutional trust participant record-keeping functions and capital expenditures for imaging and other electronic payments initiatives.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 12
     Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2004 was higher than the second quarter of 2004 by $286.4 million (23.2 percent). The increase in noninterest expense over the second quarter of 2004 was primarily due to changes in MSR intangible valuations of $257.8 million, as well as increases in employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment, professional services, marketing and business development, technology and communications, and postage, printing and supplies. Employee benefit costs primarily reflect higher pension expense. Net occupancy and equipment costs reflect changes in rental costs, utilities and maintenance costs. Changes in marketing and business development reflect the timing of brand advertising programs and marketing campaigns while technology costs reflect capital investments and higher network costs. Other expense, excluding the impact of the expanded European merchant acquiring business, was slightly lower in the third quarter of 2004, primarily due to charge-back expense associated with the Company's airline merchant portfolio that was recorded in the second quarter of 2004.

Credit Quality
     The allowance for credit losses was $2,369.7 million at September 30, 2004, equal to the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2004, and essentially equal to the allowance for credit losses
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 14
of $2,367.7 million at September 30, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 1.90 percent at September 30, 2004, compared with 1.93 percent at June 30, 2004, and 1.98 percent at September 30, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 337 percent at September 30, 2004, compared with 299 percent at June 30, 2004, and 202 percent at September 30, 2003. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2004 were $165.1 million, compared with the second quarter of 2004 net charge-offs of $204.5 million and the third quarter of 2003 net charge-offs of $309.9 million.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $26.1 million for the third quarter of 2004, or .16 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $57.1 million, or .35 percent of average loans outstanding, in the second quarter of 2004 and $153.6 million, or .88 percent of average loans outstanding, in the third quarter of 2003. The decline in net charge-offs continues to be broad-based across most industries within the commercial loan portfolio and was favorably influenced by higher levels of commercial loan recoveries in the third quarter of 2004. Commercial loan recoveries are expected to return to more normal levels in future periods.
     Retail loan net charge-offs of $132.3 million in the third quarter of 2004 were $7.8 million (5.6 percent) lower than the second quarter of 2004 and $16.7 million (11.2 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2003. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were 1.26 percent in the third quarter of 2004, compared with 1.39 percent and 1.54 percent in the second quarter of 2004 and third quarter of 2003, respectively. Lower levels of retail loan net charge-offs principally reflected the Company's improvement in ongoing collection efforts and risk management.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 15
     The overall level of net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2004 reflected the Company's ongoing efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the organization and the higher level of commercial loan recoveries during the third quarter of 2004. Net charge-offs are expected to increase modestly as commercial loan recoveries return to more normal levels in future periods.

*does not include accruing loans 90 days or more past due
     Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2004, totaled $804.6 million, compared with $910.9 million at June 30, 2004, and $1,318.3 million at September 30, 2003. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was .64 percent at September 30, 2004, compared with .74 percent at June 30, 2004, and 1.10 percent at September 30, 2003. While nonperforming assets are expected to continue to decline slightly during the next few quarters, the ongoing level of nonperforming assets is expected to stabilize at those lower levels.
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 17
     Total shareholders' equity was $19.6 billion at September 30, 2004, compared with $19.8 billion at September 30, 2003. The decrease was primarily the result of corporate earnings offset by share buybacks and dividends, including the special dividend of $685 million related to the December 31, 2003, spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies.
     Tangible common equity to assets was 6.4 percent at September 30, 2004, compared with 6.3 percent at June 30, 2004, and 6.5 percent at September 30, 2003. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.7 percent at September 30, 2004, and at June 30, 2004, compared with 9.0 percent at September 30, 2003. The total risk-based capital ratio was 12.7 percent at September 30, 2004, compared with 12.9 percent at June 30, 2004, and 13.5 percent at September 30, 2003. The leverage ratio was 7.9 percent at September 30, 2004, compared with 7.8 percent at June 30, 2004, and 8.0 percent at September 30, 2003. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of stated "well capitalized" requirements.

     On December 16, 2003, the board of directors of U.S. Bancorp approved an authorization to repurchase 150 million shares of outstanding common stock during the following 24 months. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased 19.5 million shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2004, there were approximately 68 million shares remaining to be repurchased under the current authorization.

Lines of Business
     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is available and is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense. Designations, assignments and allocations may change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. During 2004, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results have been restated and presented on a comparable basis.
     Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking contributed $278.0 million of the Company's operating earnings in the third quarter of 2004, a 30.4
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 20
percent increase over the same period of 2003 and a 4.4 percent increase over the second quarter of 2004. The increase in Wholesale Banking's third quarter 2004 contribution over the third quarter of 2003 was primarily the result of favorable variances in the provision for credit losses and total noninterest expense (6.7 percent), partially offset by a decrease in total net revenue (4.3 percent). The decline in total net revenue from the third quarter of 2003 reflected unfavorable variances in both net interest income (4.4 percent) and noninterest income (4.6 percent). The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decline in average total loans outstanding (6.5 percent) and average noninterest bearing deposits (13.3 percent) and savings products (32.6 percent) due, in part, to lower deposits associated with government banking and mortgage banking activities. The decline in noninterest income was primarily the result of unfavorable variances in treasury management fees and commercial products revenue. Treasury management fees were lower (9.1 percent) year-over-year due to a reduction in fees from the Federal government relative to the same quarter of 2003, while the unfavorable variance in commercial products revenue (2.9 percent) was primarily due to lower capital markets activity and other non-yield-related loan fees. Wholesale Banking's favorable variance in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily the result of a decline in net shared services (9.0 percent), which is primarily driven by customer transaction volume and account activities. The decrease in the provision for credit losses year-over-year was the result of the favorable change from net charge-offs of $104.4 million in the third quarter of 2003 to net recoveries of $12.7 million in the current quarter. The increase in Wholesale Banking's contribution to operating earnings in the third quarter of 2004 over the second quarter of 2004 was the net result of favorable variances in the provision for credit losses and total noninterest expense (2.5 percent), partially offset by lower total net revenue (1.2 percent). Total net revenue was slightly lower on a linked quarter basis, with essentially flat net interest income, but lower noninterest income (3.8 percent). The unfavorable variance quarter-over-quarter in noninterest income was primarily attributed to lower treasury management fees, the result of lower Federal tax receipt processing activity relative to the second quarter of 2004. The decrease in noninterest expense was principally due to lower net shared services and professional services expense. Net recoveries for the third quarter of 2004 drove the favorable variance in provision for credit losses over the prior quarter.
     Consumer Banking delivers products and services to the broad consumer market and small businesses through banking offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and automated

teller machines ("ATMs"). It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, branch ATM banking, small business banking, including lending guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, small-ticket leasing, consumer lending, mortgage banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking, and investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking contributed $409.5 million of the Company's operating earnings in the third quarter of 2004, a 15.3 percent increase over the same period of 2003 and a 5.4 percent increase over the second quarter of 2004. While the retail banking business segment grew operating earnings by 26.2 percent and 10.5 percent over the third quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2004, respectively, the contribution of the mortgage banking business declined from both of the previous reporting periods. The decrease in the mortgage banking business's contribution from the third quarter of 2003 was the net result of a decline in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense, excluding the change in MSR valuation. The increase in noninterest expense, excluding the change in MSR valuation, was primarily due to an increase in other intangible amortization, the result of the growing servicing portfolio. In the third quarter of 2004, as in the third quarter of 2003, net gains (losses) on securities in the mortgage banking business line were offset by the change in MSR valuation. The mortgage banking business line's contribution declined in the third quarter of 2004 from the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower net interest income and noninterest income and higher operating expense.
     For the Consumer Banking business, as a whole, the favorable variance in gains (losses) on the sale of securities was offset with the unfavorable variance in MSR valuation year-over-year. Excluding net gains (losses) on the sale of securities, total net revenue was higher than the same quarter of the 2003 by 5.2 percent, primarily due to an increase in noninterest income (18.0 percent). Consumer Banking's results also benefited from a reduction in the provision for credit losses (16.5 percent), while total noninterest expense, excluding the change in MSR valuations, was essentially flat from the third quarter of 2003. Net interest income was slightly lower year-over-year (.3 percent), the result of increases in average loans outstanding (8.7 percent), offset by declines in the average balance of loans held for sale and in the business line's net interest margin. Noninterest income improved in the third quarter of 2004 over the same period of 2003, primarily due to growth in deposit service charges (11.1 percent), commercial products revenue (45.7 percent), mortgage banking revenue (7.7 percent), investment products fees and commissions (4.0 percent) and other revenue. Other revenue was higher due to a residual value insurance recovery

during the third quarter of 2004 and a favorable change in lease residual gains (losses)Total noninterest expense, excluding the change in MSR valuation, in the third quarter of 2004 was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2003, with higher compensation and employee benefits (2.1 percent), net occupancy and equipment (1.3 percent), and other intangibles (9.7 percent), offset by lower net shared services (7.9 percent) and other expense (1.6 percent). A reduction in net charge-offs year-over-year drove the positive variance in the business line's provision for credit losses.

     The increase in Consumer Banking's contribution in the third quarter of 2004 over the second quarter of 2004 was primarily the result of favorable variances in total net revenue, excluding net gains (losses) on the sale of securities (2.1 percent), and a reduction in the provision for credit losses (5.7 percent). Offsetting these favorable variances was slightly higher noninterest expense, excluding the change in MSR valuation (.2 percent). The growth in noninterest income, excluding net gains (losses) on the sale of securities, quarter-over-quarter was driven by deposit service charges (2.7 percent), treasury management fees (5.0 percent) and other revenue (26.7 percent). The unfavorable variance in noninterest expense, excluding the change in MSR valuation, quarter-over-quarter was primarily the result of slightly higher compensation and employee benefits and other expense.
     Private Client, Trust and Asset Management provides trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund and alternative investment product services through five businesses: Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Asset Management, Institutional Trust and Custody, and Fund Services, LLC. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed $110.8 million of the Company's operating earnings in the third quarter of 2004, 11.6 percent higher than the same period of 2003 and 1.3 percent higher than the second quarter of 2004. The favorable variance in the business line's contribution in the third quarter of 2004 over the third quarter of 2003 was the result of favorable variances in net interest income (18.8 percent), total noninterest expense (1.7 percent) and the provision for credit losses. Higher average loans outstanding (3.8 percent) and average total deposits (14.5 percent) favorably impacted net interest income year-over-year. Noninterest income was slightly lower than the same quarter of 2003 (.7 percent). The increase in the business line's contribution (1.3 percent) in the third quarter of 2004 over the second quarter of 2004 was primarily the result of slightly lower total noninterest expense (.9 percent) and a favorable variance in the provision for credit losses, offset by lower total net revenue (2.0 percent). Although net interest income rose (7.8 percent) quarter-over-quarter,
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 23
noninterest income fell by 5.4 percent from the second quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2004. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by an increase in average loans outstanding (1.3 percent), while noninterest income declined partially due to seasonally lower tax preparation fees relative to the second quarter of 2004.
     Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing, and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $185.0 million of the Company's operating earnings in the third quarter of 2004, a 20.4 percent increase over the same period of 2003, and a 4.1 percent increase over the second quarter of 2004. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the third quarter of 2004 over the same period of 2003 was the result of higher total net revenue (13.6 percent) and a lower provision for credit losses (8.9 percent), partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (16.0 percent). The increase in total net revenue year-over-year was primarily due to growth in noninterest income (21.2 percent), partially offset by lower net interest income (7.4 percent), which primarily reflected higher corporate card rebates and a reduction in late fees relative to the prior year's quarter. The increase in noninterest income was principally the result of growth in credit and debit card revenue (19.4 percent), corporate payment products revenue (13.4 percent), ATM processing service revenue (13.5 percent) and merchant processing services revenue (28.2 percent). Although credit and debit card revenue was negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2004 by the VISA debit card settlement and higher customer loyalty rewards expense, increases in transaction volumes and other rate changes more than offset these detrimental changes. The increase in merchant processing revenue included approximately $26 million associated with the expansion of the Company's merchant acquiring business in Europe. The growth in total noninterest expense year-over-year primarily reflected an increase in processing expense related to the business line's revenue growth, including approximately $23 million associated with the European merchant acquiring business. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the third quarter of 2004 over the second quarter of 2004 was primarily due to seasonally strong total net revenue (4.8 percent) and lower provision for credit losses (5.5 percent), offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (9.7 percent), the result of the increase in processing-related expense and the expansion of the merchant acquiring business in Europe.
     Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results October 19, 2004 Page 24
of transfer pricing related to average balances and the residual aggregate of expenses associated with business activities managed on a corporate basis, including enterprise-wide operations and administrative support functions. Operational expenses incurred by Treasury and Corporate Support on behalf of the other business lines are allocated back primarily based on customer transaction volume and account activities to the appropriate business unit and are identified as net shared services expense. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded operating earnings of $82.2 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared with operating earnings of $126.1 million in the third quarter of 2003 and $95.0 million in the second quarter of 2004. The decrease in operating earnings in the current quarter from the third quarter of 2003 was largely due to lower total net revenue (7.5 percent) and higher total noninterest expense (39.6 percent). Lower total net revenue reflected the Company's asset/liability management decisions to invest in lower-yield floating-rate securities, higher-cost fixed funding and repositioning of the balance sheet for changes in the interest rate environment. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year reflected higher compensation and employee benefits, specifically performance-based incentives and pension expense, as well as an unfavorable variance in net shared services. The unfavorable variance in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2004 from the second quarter of 2004 was the result of lower total net revenue (5.8 percent) and higher total noninterest expense (5.0 percent). Total net revenue declined quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the continuing asset/liability management decisions of the Company, while the increase in noninterest expense reflected higher net occupancy and equipment costs and other expense.
