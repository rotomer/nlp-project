Exhibit 99.1
     (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $1,121 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $1,037 million for the second quarter of 2004. Net income of $.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005 was higher than the same period of 2004 by $.06 (11.1 percent). Return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.23 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2005, compared with returns of 2.19 percent and 21.9 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2004.
MINNEAPOLIS, July 19, 2005  U.S. Bancorp
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "I am very proud to announce that our Company has achieved another quarter of record earnings and industry leading returns on equity and assets. The results included strong year-over-year and seasonal growth in our fee-based businesses, as well as exceptional credit quality. Loan growth in the second quarter of 2005 was excellent, increasing 8.3 percent over the same quarter of 2004 and at an annualized rate of 11.2 percent over the prior quarter. Once again, we exceeded our stated target
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2005 Results July 19, 2005 Page 2
and returned 92 percent of earnings to our shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
     "Fee revenue, excluding the impact of securities gains (losses), continued to drive revenue growth this quarter, increasing 8.9 percent over the second quarter of 2004. Investments and core growth in our Payments Services and Consumer Banking business units were the primary drivers of the growth in fees, increasing 17.1 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.
     "The growth in commercial loans was particularly encouraging this quarter, as average outstandings grew 9.0 percent over the second quarter of 2004 and, more importantly, at an annualized rate of 16.8 percent over the first quarter of 2005. Although credit spreads continued to tighten, accounting for 4 of the 9 basis point drop in the net margin on a linked quarter basis, we have remained competitive and disciplined in our approach to the market, capitalizing on our ability to compete on price while offering a wide array of non-credit products to fulfill our customers' needs.
     "I am especially pleased with the exceptional improvement we have seen in the Company's credit quality over the past year. Our loss and coverage ratios are better than our Company has experienced in many years and are the direct result of the actions we have taken to reduce the risk profile of the Company. We expect to continue to grow our credit-related businesses, both commercial and retail, while maintaining the discipline that has helped us reach these quality metrics today.
     "We are well on our way to meeting our financial goals for 2005 and beyond. We will continue to invest in our franchise, as we have been, to create and enhance our set of products and services, increase our market penetration and provide outstanding service to our customers."
     The Company's results for the second quarter of 2005 improved over the same period of 2004, as net income rose by $84 million (8.1 percent), primarily due to growth in fee-based products and services, reduced credit costs and lower tax expense. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recognized a $53 million impairment of its mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") asset, reflecting lower longer-term interest rates in the second quarter of 2005, compared with the recognition of $171 million reparation of its MSR asset in the second quarter of 2004. Also included in the second quarter of 2005 results was a $54 million charge related to a completed tender offer for debt securities and a $94 million reduction in income tax expense related to the

resolution of federal tax examinations covering all of the Company's legal entities for all years through 2002.
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the second quarter of 2005 was $281 million (9.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting 8.9 percent growth in fee-based revenue across the majority of fee categories, expansion in payments processing businesses and a $173 million favorable variance in securities gains (losses), partially offset by a 1.0 percent reduction in net interest income.
     Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2005 was $362 million (29.4 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting the $224 million unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the $54 million charge related to the Company's recent tender offer for certain subordinated and trust preferred debt securities. In addition, expenses reflected incremental costs related to expanding the payment processing businesses, investments in in-store branches, adding middle market and community bankers, marketing initiatives and higher pension costs from a year ago.
     Provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2005 was $144 million, a decrease of $60 million (29.4 percent) from the second quarter of 2004. The decrease in the provision for credit losses year-over-year reflected a decrease in total net charge-offs. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2005 were $144 million, compared with the first quarter of 2005 net charge-offs of $172 million and the second quarter of 2004 net charge-offs of $204 million. Total nonperforming assets declined to $610 million at June 30, 2005, from $665 million at March 31, 2005 (8.3 percent), and $911 million at June 30, 2004 (33.0 percent). The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 441 percent at June 30, 2005, compared with 404 percent at March 31, 2005, and 299 percent at June 30, 2004.

Net Interest Income
     Second quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,761 million, compared with $1,779 million recorded in the second quarter of 2004. Average earning assets for the period increased over the second quarter of 2004 by $9.7 billion (5.8 percent), primarily driven by a $3.3 billion (8.2 percent) increase in retail loans, a $3.2 billion (8.1 percent) increase in total commercial loans and a $3.1 billion (22.4 percent) increase in residential mortgages. The positive impact to net interest income from the growth in earning assets was more than offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin in the second quarter of 2005 was 3.99 percent, compared with 4.28 percent in the second quarter of 2004. The decline in the net interest margin reflected the current lending environment, asset/liability management decisions and the impact of changes in the yield curve from a year ago. Since the second quarter of 2004, credit spreads have tightened by approximately 18 basis points across most lending products due to competitive pricing and a change in mix due to growth in lower spread credit products. The net interest margin also declined due to funding incremental growth with higher cost wholesale funding and asset/liability decisions designed to maintain a relatively neutral rate risk position, including reducing the duration of the securities portfolio, funding asset growth with more fixed rate long term debt and a 56 percent

reduction in the net receive fixed swap position between June 30, 2004, and June 30, 2005. Increases in the margin benefit of deposits and net free funds helped to partially offset these factors.
     Net interest income in the second quarter of 2005 was higher than the first quarter of 2005 by $10 million (.6 percent). Average earning assets grew quarter-over-quarter by $3.4 billion (2.0 percent). Growth in most loan categories, including a 3.7 percent increase in total commercial loans, drove the increase in average earning assets over the prior quarter. The positive impact to net interest income from the growth in earning assets and day basis was partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin in the second quarter of 2005 was 9 basis points lower than the net interest margin of 4.08 percent recorded in the first quarter of 2005. The decline in the net interest margin from the first quarter of 2005 reflected tighter credit spreads (4 basis points) due to increased competition, in addition to changes in loan mix. Higher short-term rates, funding a higher percentage of earning asset growth with wholesale funding and asset/liability actions designed to maintain a relatively neutral rate risk position, including a 31 percent reduction in the net receive fixed swap position between March 31, 2005, and June 30, 2005, also contributed to the margin reduction. This was partially offset by the higher margin benefit of deposits and net free funds and loan fees.

     Average loans for the second quarter of 2005 were $10.1 billion (8.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2004, driven by growth in average retail loans of $3.3 billion (8.2 percent), total commercial loans of $3.2 billion (8.1 percent) and residential mortgages of $3.1 billion (22.4 percent). Total commercial real estate loans also increased slightly year-over-year by $466 million (1.7 percent). Average loans for the second quarter of 2005 were higher than the first quarter of 2005 by $3.6 billion (2.8 percent), reflecting growth in substantially all loan categories.
     Average investment securities in the second quarter of 2005 were $148 million (.3 percent) lower than in the second quarter of 2004. Investment securities at June 30, 2005, were $2.0 billion higher than at June 30, 2004, but $804 million lower than the balance at March 31, 2005. The changes in the balance of the investment securities portfolio from a year ago principally reflected the net impact of repositioning the investment portfolio during 2004 as part of asset/liability risk management decisions to acquire variable rate and shorter-term fixed securities to reduce the effective duration of the portfolio and to maintain a relatively neutral interest rate risk position. The

decline from first quarter of 2005 primarily represented maturities or prepayments with the proceeds being utilized to fund loan growth. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company retained its mix of approximately 39 percent variable rate securities.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2005 were lower than the second quarter of 2004 by $1.5 billion (4.8 percent). The year-over-year change in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was impacted by product changes in the Consumer Banking business line. In late 2004, the Company migrated approximately $1.3 billion of noninterest-bearing deposit balances to interest checking accounts as an enhancement to its Silver Elite Checking product. Average branch-based noninterest-bearing deposits in the second quarter of 2005, excluding the migration of certain high-value customers to Silver Elite Checking, were higher by approximately $200 million (1.7 percent) over the same quarter of 2004, as net new checking accounts continue to grow. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in other areas, including commercial banking and private client, trust and asset management, also increased year-over-year. These favorable variances were offset, however, by expected declines in average noninterest-bearing deposits in corporate banking as customers utilize their excess liquidity.
     Average total savings products declined year-over-year by $2.4 billion (4.0 percent), due to reductions in average money market account balances and savings accounts, partially offset by
(More)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2005 Results July 19, 2005 Page 9
higher interest checking balances. Average branch-based interest checking deposits increased by $2.5 billion (16.5 percent) over the same quarter of 2004, in part, due to the change in the Silver Elite Checking product, as well as new account growth. Average branch-based interest checking deposits, excluding Silver Elite Checking, were higher by approximately $1.2 billion (8.0 percent) year-over-year. This positive variance in branch-based interest checking account deposits was partially offset by reductions in other areas, principally corporate banking. Average money market account balances declined by $4.7 billion (13.7 percent) year-over-year, with the largest declines in the branches, national corporate banking and government banking. The overall decrease in average money market account balances year-over-year was the result of the Company's deposit pricing decisions. A portion of the money market balances have migrated to time deposits greater than $100,000 as rates increased on the time deposit products.
     Average time certificates less than $100,000 were higher in the second quarter of 2005 than the second quarter of 2004 by $131 million (1.0 percent). The Company also experienced year-over-year growth in average time deposits greater than $100,000 of $7.9 billion (62.7 percent), most notably in corporate banking, as customers migrated balances to higher rate deposits.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2005 were $731 million (2.6 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2005. Average savings products declined by $905 million (1.5 percent) in the current quarter from the first quarter of 2005. Average interest checking deposits declined slightly quarter-over-quarter, the net result of higher average branch-related interest checking balances (2.2 percent), offset by lower balances in other business lines, principally corporate banking. Average money market account balances declined by $701 million (2.3 percent) as the Company continued to lag deposit pricing. Time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 increased modestly from the first quarter of 2005, while time deposits greater than $100,000 rose by $1.8 billion (9.7 percent), primarily due to growth in corporate banking customer balances and foreign branch time deposits.

Noninterest Income
     Second quarter noninterest income was $1,541 million, an increase of $299 million (24.1 percent) from the same quarter of 2004, and $159 million (11.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2005. The increase in noninterest income over the second quarter of 2004 was driven by favorable variances in securities gains (losses) and in the majority of fee income categories. Credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue were both higher in the second quarter of 2005 than the second quarter of 2004 by $18 million and $17 million, or 11.3 percent and 16.5 percent, respectively. The growth in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes and rate changes. The corporate payment products revenue growth reflected growth in sales, card usage, rate changes and the recent acquisition of a small fleet card business. ATM processing services revenue was higher by $12 million (26.7 percent) in the second quarter of 2005 than the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the expansion of the ATM business in May of 2005. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in the second quarter of 2005 than the same quarter of 2004 by $33 million (20.0 percent), reflecting an increase in sales volume, new

business, higher equipment fees and the expansion of business in Europe. Deposit service charges were higher year-over-year by $32 million (15.8 percent) due to account growth and transaction-related fees. Other income was higher by $28 million (26.2 percent), primarily due to higher income from equity investments relative to the same quarter of 2004Partially offsetting these positive variances year-over-year were commercial products revenue, treasury management fees and investment products fees and commissions, which declined by $8 million (7.4 percent), $4 million (3.3 percent) and $4 million (9.3 percent), respectively. Commercial products revenue declined due to reductions in loan fees and international product revenue. The decrease in treasury management fees was primarily due to higher earnings credit on customers' compensating balances. The decline in investment management fees and commissions reflected lower sales volume relative to the same quarter in 2004.
.
     Noninterest income was higher in the second quarter of 2005 than the first quarter of 2005 by $159 million (11.5 percent), primarily due to a $60 million favorable change in gains (losses) on the sale of securities and increases in the majority of the remaining fee income categories. Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and merchant processing services rose by $23 million (14.9 percent), $13 million (12.1 percent) and $20 million (11.2 percent), respectively, reflecting seasonally higher sales. ATM processing services revenue increased by $10 million (21.3 percent) primarily due to the expansion of the business. Deposit service charges were higher by $24 million (11.4 percent) in the second quarter of 2005 compared with the first quarter of 2005, reflecting higher transaction-related fees and net new account growth. The increase in trust and investment management fees and treasury management fees over the first quarter of 2005 reflected seasonally strong tax-related processing revenue. Mortgage banking revenue was higher by $8 million (7.8 percent) than the prior quarter due to stronger loan production. Slightly offsetting these favorable variances was other income which was lower quarter-over-quarter by $19 million (12.3 percent), primarily due to a decline in revenue from equity investments relative to the first quarter of 2005.

Noninterest Expense
     Second quarter noninterest expense totaled $1,595 million, an increase of $362 million (29.4 percent) over the same quarter of 2004 and a $264 million (19.8 percent) increase over the first quarter of 2005. The increase in expense year-over-year was primarily driven by the $224 million unfavorable change in the MSR valuation, as well as the increase of $52 million in debt prepayment charges relative to the second quarter of 2004. Compensation expense was higher year-over-year by $39 million (6.8 percent), principally due to business expansion of in-store branches, investments in commercial and community bankers, expansion of the Company's payments processing businesses, and other growth initiatives. Employee benefits increased year-over-year by $17 million (18.7 percent), primarily as a result of higher pension expense and payroll taxes. Marketing and business development was higher in the second quarter of 2005 than the second quarter of 2004 by $18 million (36.7 percent) due to marketing initiatives and the timing of contributions to the Company's charitable foundation. Technology and communications expense rose by $11 million (10.8 percent), reflecting technology investments that increased software expense, in addition to outside data processing expense. Other expense declined in the second

quarter from the same quarter of 2004 by $16 million (7.4 percent), primarily due to decreases in other loan expense, insurance, lower merchant charge-back risk, and other operating losses.
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2005 was higher than the first quarter of 2005 by $264 million (19.8 percent). The increase in noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2005 was primarily driven by the $107 million unfavorable change in the MSR valuation quarter-over-quarter, as well as the $54 million charge taken in connection with the Company's tender offer for certain debt securities in the second quarter of 2005. The increase in compensation expense of $45 million (7.9 percent) in the second quarter over the prior quarter was primarily due to acquisitions, merit-based salary increases and higher incentive and commission-based compensation costs in the second quarter of 2005, while employee benefits declined by $8 million (6.9 percent) due to seasonally lower payroll taxes. Marketing and business development and technology and communications rose quarter-over-quarter by $24 million (55.8 percent) and $7 million (6.6 percent), respectively. The variance in marketing and business development reflected the timing of marketing programs and contributions to the Company's charitable foundation. Technology and communications rose relative to the prior quarter due to business investment and increases in data transmission costs. Other expense was higher in the second quarter of 2005 than the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to acquisition integration costs and write-downs associated with certain co-branding and lease arrangements.

Credit Quality
     The allowance for credit losses was $2,269 million at June 30, 2005, equal to the allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2005, and slightly lower than the allowance for credit losses of $2,370

million at June 30, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 1.70 percent at June 30, 2005, compared with 1.76 percent at March 31, 2005, and 1.93 percent at June 30, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 441 percent at June 30, 2005, compared with 404 percent at March 31, 2005, and 299 percent at June 30, 2004. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2005 were $144 million, compared with the first quarter of 2005 net charge-offs of $172 million and the second quarter of 2004 net charge-offs of $204 million.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $13 million for the second quarter of 2005, or .07 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $33 million, or .20 percent of average loans outstanding, in the first quarter of 2005 and $57 million, or .35 percent of average loans outstanding, in the second quarter of 2004. The decline in net charge-offs reflected a stronger level of recoveries than prior quarters, as well as broad-based improvement in the overall quality of the commercial loan portfolio.
     Retail loan net charge-offs of $123 million in the second quarter of 2005 were $7 million (5.4 percent) lower than the first quarter of 2005 and $17 million (12.1 percent) lower than the second quarter of 2004. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were 1.12 percent in the second quarter of 2005, compared with 1.22 percent and 1.38 percent in the first quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2004, respectively. Lower levels of retail loan net charge-offs principally reflected the Company's ongoing improvement in collection efforts and risk management.

     Total shareholders' equity was $19.9 billion at June 30, 2005, compared with $18.7 billion at June 30, 2004. The increase was the result of corporate earnings offset by share buybacks and dividends.
     Tangible common equity to assets was 6.1 percent at June 30, 2005, compared with 6.2 percent at March 31, 2005, and 6.3 percent at June 30, 2004. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.1 percent at June 30, 2005, compared with 8.6 percent at March 31, 2005, and 8.7 percent at June 30, 2004. The total risk-based capital ratio was 12.5 percent at June 30, 2005, compared with 13.3 percent at March 31, 2005, and 12.9 percent at June 30, 2004. The leverage ratio was 7.5 percent at June 30, 2005, compared with 7.9 percent at March 31, 2005, and 7.8 percent at June 30, 2004.

Lines of Business
     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is available and is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. During 2005, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results have been restated and presented on a comparable basis.

     Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking contributed $267 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2005, a 9.9 percent increase over the same period of 2004 and a 4.7 percent increase over the first quarter of 2005. The increase in Wholesale Banking's second quarter 2005 contribution over the same quarter of 2004 was primarily the result of favorable variances in total net revenue (2.8 percent) and the provision for credit losses. Partly offsetting these positive variances was an increase in total noninterest expense (1.4 percent). The favorable variance in total net revenue year-over-year was primarily the result of growth in net interest income (4.3 percent), as the business line's noninterest income remained flat. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in average loans outstanding and wider deposit spreads, partially offset by tighter credit spreads. Noninterest income was flat year-over-year, as declines in commercial products revenue (3.4 percent) and treasury management fees (1.2 percent) were offset by higher revenue from equity investments relative to the second quarter of 2004. Wholesale Banking's unfavorable variance in total noninterest expense year-over-year was the result of higher compensation and employee benefits, the result of merit-based increases, new hires and production-based incentives, in addition to higher net shared services expense. Net recoveries of $16 million in the current quarter, compared with net charge-offs of $8 million in the second quarter of 2004, drove the favorable variance in the provision for credit losses year-over-year. The increase in Wholesale Banking's contribution to net income in the second quarter of 2005 over the first quarter of 2005 was the result of favorable variances in total net revenue (1.5 percent) and the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (4.5 percent). Total net revenue was higher on a linked quarter basis, with an increase in net interest income (3.3 percent) partially offset by a decline in total noninterest income (1.9 percent). The favorable variance quarter-over-quarter in net interest income was primarily attributed to an increase in average loans outstanding and deposit balances, as well as wider deposit spreads. The decrease in noninterest income quarter-over-quarter was due to favorable variances in commercial products revenue and treasury management fees, which were more than offset by a decrease in other income related to revenue from equity investments. Commercial products revenue benefited from stronger capital markets related fees, while the growth in treasury management fees reflected seasonal tax receipt processing. The increase in total noninterest expense was principally due to higher net shared services expense related to customer transaction volumes and seasonal tax

receipt processing activities, partially offset by lower compensation and employee benefits and other expense. Net recoveries of $16 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with net charge-offs of $3 million in the first quarter of 2005, drove the favorable variance in the provision for credit losses quarter-over-quarter.
     Consumer Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and ATMs. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, in-store banking, small business banking, including lending guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, small-ticket leasing, consumer lending, mortgage banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking, and investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking contributed $452 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2005, a 22.5 percent increase over the same period of 2004 and an 11.6 percent increase over the prior quarter. The favorable increase year-over-year was the result of higher total net revenue (9.1 percent) and lower provision for credit losses (26.9 percent), partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (2.9 percent). Total net revenue was higher than the same quarter of 2004 due to increases in both net interest income (10.8 percent) and noninterest income (6.1 percent). Net interest income was higher year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher deposit spreads, as income from growth in average loan balances was offset by lower spreads on those assets. Noninterest income improved in the second quarter of 2005 over the same period of 2004, principally due to growth in deposit service charges (15.9 percent). Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2005 was higher than the same quarter of 2004, primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits (5.4 percent), the result of the Company's in-store branch expansion, other hiring initiatives and incentives, in addition to higher net shared services expense (5.5 percent). A 26.9 percent reduction in net charge-offs year-over-year drove the positive variance in the business line's provision for credit losses.
     The increase in Consumer Banking's contribution in the second quarter of 2005 over the prior quarter was the net result of favorable variances in total net revenue (6.5 percent) and provision for credit losses (15.0 percent), partly offset by an increase in noninterest expense (4.1 percent). Net interest income was higher quarter-over-quarter largely due to increases in average loans outstanding and deposit spreads relative to the prior quarter, which were partly offset by lower credit spreads. Noninterest income was higher (11.6 percent) than the prior quarter primarily due to growth in deposit service charges, mortgage banking revenue and other revenue, the result of a

favorable change in lease residual income. The unfavorable variance in total noninterest expense quarter-over-quarter was driven by an increase in net shared services expense and other expense, mainly the result of higher marketing and business development expense. A 15.0 percent reduction in net charge-offs quarter-over-quarter drove the positive variance in the provision for credit losses.
     Private Client, Trust and Asset Management provides trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund servicing through five businesses: Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Asset Management, Institutional Trust and Custody and Fund Services. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed $116 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2005, 22.1 percent higher than the same period of 2004 and 3.6 percent higher than the prior quarter of 2005. The increase in the business line's contribution in the second quarter of 2005 over the same quarter of 2004 was the result of favorable variances in total net revenue (7.9 percent) and the provision for credit losses (77.8 percent). Total noninterest expense remained flat year-over-year. Net interest income was favorably impacted year-over-year by deposit spreads, while noninterest income was essentially equal to the same quarter of 2004, as gains from equity market valuations were offset by lower fees, partially due to a change in the mix of fund balances and customers' migration from paying for services with fees to paying with compensating balances. Lower net charge-offs drove the positive change in provision for credit losses year-over-year. The increase in the business line's contribution (3.6 percent) in the second quarter of 2005 over the prior quarter was the result of higher total net revenue (3.4 percent), partly offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (1.7 percent) and provision for credit losses. Net interest income and noninterest income rose quarter-over-quarter by 6.7 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in average deposit balances and favorable deposit spreads, while noninterest income increased largely due to seasonally higher tax preparation fees. Total noninterest expense was slightly higher in the second quarter due to an increase in net shared services expense.
     Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing, and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $178 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2005, a 10.6 percent increase over the same period of 2004 and a 7.9 percent increase over the first quarter of 2005. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the second quarter of 2005 over the same period of 2004 was the result of higher total net revenue (11.6 percent) and a slightly

lower provision for credit losses (2.1 percent), partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (17.4 percent). The increase in total net revenue year-over-year was primarily due to growth in noninterest income (17.1 percent), partially offset by a reduction in net interest income (7.2 percent), reflecting higher corporate card balances and rebates. The increase in noninterest income was principally the result of growth in credit and debit card revenue (12.0 percent), corporate payment products revenue (16.5 percent), ATM processing services revenue (40.0 percent) and merchant processing services revenue (20.0 percent). All categories benefited from higher transaction volumes, some rate changes and business expansion initiatives. The growth in total noninterest expense year-over-year primarily reflected an increase in processing expense related to the business line's revenue growth, including costs associated with expansion of the European merchant acquiring business and other smaller payment services acquisitions. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the second quarter of 2005 over the prior quarter was primarily due to seasonally strong growth in total net revenue (7.8 percent), partly offset by higher total noninterest expense (9.4 percent) and provision for credit losses (3.4 percent). Net interest income decreased 8.5 percent quarter-over-quarter, while fee-based revenue rose by 12.6 percent due to seasonally higher retail and corporate credit card sales volumes, ATM processing services revenue and merchant processing fees. The unfavorable variance in total noninterest expense from the prior quarter was primarily due to personnel and other costs to support ongoing business expansion and higher processing volumes, in addition to higher net shared services expense.
     Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. In addition, changes in MSR valuations primarily due to interest rates are managed at a corporate level and, as such, reported within this business unit. Operational expenses incurred by Treasury and Corporate Support on behalf of the other business lines are allocated back to the appropriate business unit, primarily based on customer transaction volume and account activities, deposit balances and employee levels and are identified as net shared services expense. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net income of $108 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $169 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $134 million in the first quarter of 2005. The decrease in net income in the current quarter from the same quarter of 2004 was the net result of

unfavorable variances in net interest income ($147 million), the MSR valuation ($224 million) and debt prepayment expense ($52 million), partially offset by a $173 million favorable change in net securities gains (losses) and the $94 million tax benefit realized by the Company in the current quarter. The unfavorable change in net interest income (56.3 percent) year-over-year reflected the Company's asset/liability management decisions to invest in lower-yield floating-rate securities, higher-cost fixed funding and repositioning of the Company for changes in the interest rate environment. Net income in the second quarter of 2005 was lower than net income in the first quarter of 2005, the result of unfavorable variances in net interest income ($36 million), the MSR valuation ($107 million) and debt prepayment expense ($54 million), partly offset by favorable variances in securities gains (losses) ($56 million) and the $94 million tax benefit realized in the current quarter. Total net interest income declined quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the continuing asset/liability management decisions of the Company.
