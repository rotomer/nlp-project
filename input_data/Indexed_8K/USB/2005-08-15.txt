Exhibit 1.1
August 3, 2005
U.S. Bancorp USB Capital VII 800 Nicollet Mall Minneapolis, MN 55402 Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We (the "Representatives") understand that USB Capital VII, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), and U.S. Bancorp, a Delaware corporation, as sponsor of the Trust and as guarantor (the "Guarantor"), propose that the Trust issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule I (the "Underwriters") 12,000,000 5.875% Trust Preferred Securities (liquidation amount $25 per Preferred Security) with an aggregate liquidation amount of $300,000,000 (the "Firm Securities") representing preferred beneficial interests in the Trust. In addition, the Guarantor and the Trust grant to the Underwriters the right to request the opportunity to purchase up to an additional 1,800,000 Trust Preferred Securities (the "Optional Securities," and together with the Firm Securities, the "Offered Securities"). The Offered Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by U.S. Bancorp. The Guarantor will be the owner of all of the beneficial ownership interests represented by the common securities (liquidation amount $25 per common security) issued by the Trust (the "Common Securities"). Proceeds from the sale of the Offered Securities to the Underwriters and from the concurrent sale of the Common Securities to the Guarantor will be used to purchase 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures of the Guarantor (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures"), due 2035. The Junior Subordinated Debentures will be issued by the Guarantor pursuant to a Junior Subordinated Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of April 28, 2005, as amended, between the Guarantor and Delaware Trust Company, National Association as trustee (the "Debenture Trustee").
     The Guarantor will, through the Indenture, the Junior Subordinated Debentures, the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated as of August 15, 2005 (the "Trust Agreement") among the Guarantor, as Sponsor to the Trust, Delaware Trust Company, National Association, as Delaware Trustee and Property Trustee, and the Administrative Trustees named therein (collectively, the "Trustees"), the Guarantee Agreement dated as of August 15, 2005 (the "Guarantee") between the Guarantor and Delaware Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"), taken together, fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee on a subordinated basis all of the Trust's obligations under the Offered Securities.
     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and incorporated by reference herein, the Guarantor and the Trust hereby agree that the Guarantor shall sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the numbers of the Firm Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter at a purchase price of $24.2125 per Firm Security, plus accrued distributions, if any (collectively the "Purchase Price"). In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and incorporated by reference herein, the Guarantor and the Trust grant to the Underwriters the right to request the opportunity to purchase the Optional Securities at a purchase
 
price of $24.2125 per Optional Security, plus accrued distributions, if any. The opportunity to purchase the Optional Securities hereunder is for use by the Underwriters solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Securities. The right to request the opportunity to purchase the Optional Shares may be exercised at any time upon notice by the Representatives to the Guarantor and the Trust, which notice may be given at any time within 30 days from the date of this document.
     The Offered Securities shall have the terms set forth in the Prospectus Supplement dated August 3, 2005.
     Except as otherwise provided herein, all the provisions contained in the document entitled "U.S. Bancorp Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (Capital Securities) (August 3, 2005)" (the "Standard Underwriting Agreement") are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety and shall be deemed to be a part of this Underwriting Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Standard Underwriting Agreement.
     Certificates for the Firm Securities purchased by each Underwriter shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Guarantor to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the Purchase Price therefor in federal (same day) funds, on the "Closing Date," which shall be 10:00 AM (New York City time) on August 15, 2005 at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, or at such other place and time as the Representatives, the Guarantor and the Trust may agree upon in writing. Delivery to the Underwriters of and payment to the Guarantor for any Optional Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be made at the aforementioned offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, or at such other place and time as the Representatives, the Guarantor and the Trust may agree upon in writing, at such time on such date, which may be the same as the Closing Date, but shall in no event be earlier than the Closing Date nor earlier than two nor later than three business days after the giving of the notice to exercise the option of the Underwriters.
     This document may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same document.

     The standard provisions hereof may be incorporated by reference in any Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, the term "Trust" means the statutory business trust named in the first sentence of the Underwriting Agreement. The term "Agreement" means the Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions hereof incorporated therein by reference. Unless otherwise defined herein, all other defined terms have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Underwriting Agreement.
     The Guarantor and each of USB VII, USB VIII, USB IX, USB X, USB XI, USB XII, USB XIII, USB XIV, USB XV and USB XVI, severally and not jointly, issue from time to time, in one or more series, capital securities (the "Securities") pursuant to the provisions of the registration statement on Form S-3 filed on March 2, 2005 Registration No. 333-124535. Such Securities may be issued in amounts, at prices and other terms to be determined in light of market conditions at the time of sale. The specific number of the Securities, title and liquidation preference of each Security, issuance price, distribution rate or rates (or method of calculation), distribution periods, distribution payment dates, redemption provisions, and any other specific terms of the Securities shall be set forth in a prospectus supplement.
     The Securities specified in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement are the "Firm Securities." If specified in such Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantor and the Trust may grant to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of the Securities specified in such Underwriting Agreement as provided in Article III hereof (the "Optional Securities"). The Firm Securities and the Optional Securities, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Article III hereof are herein collectively called the "Offered Securities."
     The Guarantor and USB VII, USB VIII, USB IX, USB X, USB XI, USB XII, USB XIII, USB XIV, USB XV and USB XVI, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement in respect of the Securities, the Guarantee and the
 
Junior Subordinated Debentures (collectively, the "Registered Securities"), including a prospectus relating to the Registered Securities, and will file with, the Commission a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The term "Registration Statement" means the registration statement as amended to the date of the Underwriting Agreement and includes any registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act. The term "Basic Prospectus" means a prospectus included in the Registration Statement. The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"), as filed with, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424. The term "preliminary prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities together with the Basic Prospectus. As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement," "Basic Prospectus," "Prospectus" and "preliminary prospectus" shall include in each case the material, if any, incorporated by reference therein as of its effective time, in the case of the Registration Statement, and as of the date of such prospectus, in the case of any Basic Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus. Any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Basic Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any document incorporated by reference after the date of such Basic Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be. Any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to include any document incorporated by reference after the effective time of such Registration Statement.
     The terms of the public offering of the Firm Securities are set forth in the Prospectus.
     The Guarantor and the Trust may specify in the Underwriting Agreement applicable to any Securities that the Guarantor and the Trust thereby grant to the Underwriters the right (an "Overallotment Option") to purchase at their election up to the number of Optional Shares set forth in such Underwriting Agreement, on the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Securities may be exercised by written notice from each of the Representatives (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) to the Guarantor and the Trust, given within a period specified in the Underwriting Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the first Closing Date or, unless the Representatives, the Guarantor and the Trust otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Underwriting Agreement.
     The number of Optional Securities to be added to the number of Firm Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement applicable to such Securities shall be, in each case, the number of Optional Securities which the Guarantor has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter; provided, that, if the Guarantor and the Trust have not been so advised, the number of Optional
 
Securities to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Securities which the number of Firm Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate number of Firm Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 10 shares). The total number of Offered Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Underwriting Agreement plus the aggregate number of Optional Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
     Payment for the Securities shall be made in federal (same day) funds at the time, date and place set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, upon delivery to the Representatives, through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Securities. Each time and date of such payment and delivery of the Securities, including any payment and delivery pursuant to the exercise of the Overallotment Option by the Underwriters, is herein referred to as a "Closing Date." The Trust will cause the certificates representing the Securities to be made available for checking and packaging at least one day prior to the Closing Date at the office of DTC or its designated custodian.
     The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Guarantor and the Trust in or incorporated by reference in the Underwriting Agreement are, at and as of each Closing Date, true and correct, the condition that the Guarantor and the Trust shall have performed all of their respective obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and to the following additional conditions:

The Guarantor and the Trust will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents, other than documents filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, proposed to be filed a reasonable time in advance of filing, and will furnish the Representatives with copies of documents filed pursuant to the Exchange Act promptly upon the filing thereof;
     (b) The Guarantor and the Trust will promptly notify the Representatives immediately (i) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) of the mailing or the delivery to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the

The Guarantor and the Trust will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order or suspension of qualification and, if any stop order or suspension of qualification is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment;
     (c) If, during the period after the date of the first public offering of the Offered Securities when the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of the counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Guarantor and the Trust, to further amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of either such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations issued by the Commission thereunder, immediate notice shall be given, and confirmed in writing, to the Representatives, and the Guarantor and the Trust will promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement comply with such requirements;

     (e) The Guarantor and the Trust will deliver to the Representatives, without charge, as many signed and conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Guarantor and the Trust will furnish to the Representatives as many copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as the Representatives shall reasonably request so long as the Underwriters are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of the Offered Securities;
 
     (f) The Guarantor and the Trust will endeavor, in cooperation with the Representatives, to qualify the Offered Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Representatives may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Offered Securities; provided, however, that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Guarantor and the Trust will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been qualified as above provided;
     (g) The Guarantor, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
     (h) During the period of 30 days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantor and Trust will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any Securities, any other beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust, or any other securities of the Trust or any other similar trust which are substantially similar to the Offered Securities, including any guarantee of such securities, or any junior subordinated debentures of the Guarantor issued to the Trust or other similar trust, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for or representing the right to receive Securities, or any such substantially similar securities of the Trust or any other similar trust, or any junior subordinated debentures of the Guarantor issued to the Trust or other similar trust, without the prior written consent of the Representatives;
     (i) The Guarantor will issue the Guarantee and the Junior Subordinated Debentures concurrently with the issue and sale of the Offered Securities as contemplated herein;

     (k) The Guarantor and the Trust will use their best efforts to list, subject to notice of issuance, the Offered Securities on the New York Stock Exchange;
     (l) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Offered Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b), and to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus after the date of the Underwriting Agreement relating to such Offered Securities and prior to any Closing Date for such Offered Securities which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Offered Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof.
 
     Each of the Guarantor and the Trust jointly and severally represents and warrants to each Underwriter that:

The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3;
     (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied or will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and when read together and with the other information in the Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement became, and any amendments thereto become, effective, and as of the Closing Date, did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were or are made, not misleading;
     (c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement and each part thereof became or hereafter become effective, complied and any amendments or supplements thereto will comply, in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. The Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement and each part thereof became effective did not and as of the Closing Date will not, contain an untrue statement of any material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, as of the date it was filed with the Commission did not, and as of the Closing Date will not, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to an Underwriter furnished in writing to the Guarantor or the Trust by such Underwriter of Offered Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Offered Securities or to that part of the Registration Statement constituting the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification under the Trust Indenture Act (Form T-1) of the Trustee;
     (d) The Guarantor has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, with corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement; and the Guarantor is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact
 
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of substantial properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to do so to qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined);
     (e) U.S. Bank National Association, the Guarantor's principal subsidiary bank, has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a national banking association in good standing under the laws of the United States and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of such bank has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and, except as provided in 12 U.S.C. Section 55, non-assessable; and 100% of its capital stock, other than any director's qualifying shares, is owned by the Guarantor, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity;
     (f) Each of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (A) the transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or
 
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement);
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Representatives as aforesaid) if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Guarantor or the Trust (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Indemnified Person), as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Representatives as aforesaid), to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above.
     (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Guarantor and the Trust, each of their respective directors or trustees, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement).
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder but
 
failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances; provided, however, that when more than one of the Underwriters is an indemnified party each such Underwriter shall be entitled to separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in each such jurisdiction to the extent such Underwriter may have interests conflicting with those of the other Underwriter or Underwriters because of the participation of one Underwriter in a transaction hereunder in which the other Underwriter or Underwriters did not participate. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Section VIII is for any reason held to be unavailable to the Underwriters in accordance with its terms, the Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to Securities sold to the Underwriters in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in such proportion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by the Underwriters to the date of such liability bears to the total sales price (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust from the sale of the Offered Securities made to the Underwriters to the date of such liability, and the Guarantor and the Trust are responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the Underwriters failed to give the notice required under (c), then the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor and the Trust or the Representatives and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were determined pro rata (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Underwriters shall not be
 
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph that were offered and sold to the public through the Underwriters exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled under this paragraph to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Guarantor, each trustee of the Trust, each officer of the Guarantor and the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Guarantor and the Trust.
     The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section VIII hereof and the representations and warranties of the Guarantor and the Trust in this Agreement or in any certificate submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Guarantor and the Trust or each of their respective directors or trustees or each of their officers or any person controlling the Guarantor and the Trust and (iii) acceptance of any payment for any of the Offered Securities, if any.
     If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Offered Securities, which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Offered Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Offered Securities then the Guarantor and the Trust shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Offered Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Guarantor and the Trust that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities or the Guarantor or the Trust notify the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities, the Representatives, the Guarantor or the Trust shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor and the Trust agree to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriters" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section X with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Offered Securities.
 
     If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Guarantor and the Trust as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Offered Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Offered Securities then the Guarantor and the Trust shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the Offered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Offered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Offered Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Guarantor and the Trust as provided in the first paragraph of this Section X, the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Offered Securities or if the Guarantor and the Trust shall not exercise the right described in the immediately preceding paragraph to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriters, the Guarantor or the Trust, except for the expenses to be borne by the Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters as provided in Section XI hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section VIII hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     The Guarantor covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Guarantor will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Guarantor's and the Trust's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and to dealers; (ii) the cost of printing this Agreement and any Blue Sky and legal investment memoranda; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Offered Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section VI hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with such qualification and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky memorandum or any Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture, the Trust Agreement and the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses incident to any Overallotment Options which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this section; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section XI. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section XI and Sections VIII and XII hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the
 
Offered Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     If the Underwriting Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Guarantor or the Trust to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, or if for any reason the Guarantor or the Trust shall be unable to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement except pursuant to Article X hereof, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated the Underwriting Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
     In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Offered Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose hereunder.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the principal offices of the Representatives and if to the Guarantor or the Trust shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the Guarantor set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, Attention: Treasurer; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section VIII hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Underwriters' Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Guarantor by the Representatives upon request.
     This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Guarantor, the Trust and, to the extent provided in Section VIII hereof, the officers and directors of the Guarantor, the Trust and each person who controls the Guarantor or the Trust or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Offered Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
 
     This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
     This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties created hereby shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

          (i) Subject to this Section 3.8, the Property Trustee shall have none of the duties, liabilities, powers or the authority of the Administrative Trustees set forth in Section 3.6.
     The Property Trustee shall exercise the powers set forth in this Section 3.8 in a manner that is consistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set out in Section 3.3, and the Property Trustee shall have no power to, and shall not, take any action that is inconsistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set out in Section 3.3.

     (iv) no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Property Trustee against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it;
     (v) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe-keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Property Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act;
 
     (vi) the Property Trustee shall have no duty or liability for or with respect to the value, genuineness, existence or sufficiency of the Debentures or the payment of any taxes or assessments levied thereon or in connection therewith;

Unless provided otherwise in this Trust Agreement, any action of the Administrative Trustees may be taken at a meeting by vote of a majority of the Administrative Trustees present (whether in person or by telephone) and eligible to vote with respect to such matter, provided that a Quorum is present, or without a meeting by the unanimous written consent of the Administrative Trustees.

     SECTION 7.1. .
General Provisions Regarding Securities
          (a) The Administrative Trustees shall on behalf of the Trust issue one class of capital securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust and one class of common securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
     (i) Capital Securities. The Capital Securities of the Trust have an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of up to three-hundred forty-five million dollars ($345,000,000) with respect to the closing of the sale of Capital Securities on one or more occasions. The Capital Securities are hereby designated for identification purposes only as "5.875% Trust Preferred Securities" (the "Capital Securities"). The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A to this Trust Agreement, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed or quoted.
     (ii) Common Securities. The Common Securities of the Trust have an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of up to ten million six-hundred seventy thousand one-hundred twenty-five dollars
 
($10,670,125) with respect to the closing of the sale of Common Securities on one or more occasions. The Common Securities are hereby designated for identification purposes only as "5.875% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities" and, together with the Capital Securities, the "Securities"). The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B to this Trust Agreement, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
          (b) Payment of Distributions on, and payment of the Redemption Price upon a redemption of, the Capital Securities and the Common Securities, as applicable, shall be made Pro Rata based on the liquidation amount of such Capital Securities and Common Securities; provided, however, that if on any date on which amounts payable on distribution or redemption, an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution on, or Redemption Price of, any of the Common Securities, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of such Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions on all of the outstanding Capital Securities for all Distribution periods terminating on or prior thereto, or, in the case of amounts payable on redemption, the full amount of the Redemption Price for all of the outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions on, or the Redemption Price of, the Capital Securities then due and payable. The Trust shall issue no securities or other interests in the assets of the Trust other than the Capital Securities and the Common Securities.
          (c) The Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Trust by an Administrative Trustee. Such signature shall be the manual or facsimile signature of any present or any future Administrative Trustee. In case an Administrative Trustee of the Trust who shall have signed any of the Certificates shall cease to be such Administrative Trustee before the Certificates so signed shall be delivered by the Trust, such Certificates nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such Certificates had not ceased to be such Administrative Trustee; and any Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Trust by such persons who, at the actual date of execution of such Certificate, shall be the Administrative Trustees of the Trust, although at the date of the execution and delivery of the Trust Agreement any such person was not such an Administrative Trustee. Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Administrative Trustees may deem appropriate, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage.
     A Certificate representing Capital Securities shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Property Trustee. Such signature shall be conclusive evidence that such Certificate has been authenticated under this Trust Agreement.
 
     Upon a written order of the Trust signed by one Administrative Trustee, the Property Trustee shall authenticate the Certificates representing Capital Securities for original issue. The aggregate amount of Capital Securities outstanding at any time shall not exceed the liquidation amount set forth in Section 7.1(a)(i).
     The Property Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Trust to authenticate Certificates. An authenticating agent may authenticate Certificates whenever the Property Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Trust Agreement to authentication by the Property Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as the Property Trustee to deal with the Sponsor or an Affiliate of the Sponsor.
          (d) The consideration received by the Trust for the issuance of the Securities shall constitute a contribution to the capital of the Trust and shall not constitute a loan to the Trust.
          (e) Upon issuance of the Securities as provided in this Trust Agreement, the Securities so issued shall be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
          (f) Every Person, by virtue of having become a Holder or a Capital Security Beneficial Owner in accordance with the terms of this Trust Agreement, shall be deemed to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms of, and shall be bound by, this Trust Agreement and the terms of the Securities.
          (g) The holders of the Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights.
     SECTION 7.2. .
Distributions
          (a) As owners of undivided beneficial ownership interests in the Debentures, holders of Securities shall be entitled to receive cumulative cash Distributions at the rate per annum of 5.875% of the stated liquidation amount of $25.00 per Security. Pursuant to the Indenture, the amount of interest on the Debentures payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly interest period, and, as a result, Distributions on the Securities payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly distribution period shall be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. Subject to Section 7.1(b), Distributions shall be made on the Capital Securities and the Common Securities on a Pro Rata basis. Pursuant to the Indenture, interest on the Debentures shall, from the date of original issue, accrue and be cumulative, and, as a result Distributions on the Securities shall, from the date of original issue, accumulate and be cumulative. Distributions shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each August 15, November 15, February 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2005, when, as and if available for payment, by the Property Trustee, except as otherwise described below. Distributions are payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Property Trustee and to the extent that the Trust has funds available for the payment of such Distributions in the Property Account.
          (b) Pursuant to the Indenture, interest not paid on the scheduled payment date will accrue and compound quarterly at the rate of 5.875% per annum, and, as a result, interests
 
on the Debentures not paid on the scheduled payment date will accrue and compound quarterly at the rate of 5.875% per annum (and, as a result) the Distributions on the Securities will accumulate and compound at the rate of 5.875% per annum ("Compounded Distributions"). "Distributions" shall mean ordinary cumulative distributions together with any Compounded Distributions.
          (c) If and to the extent that the Debenture Issuer makes a payment of interest, premium and/or principal on the Debentures held by the Property Trustee (the amount of any such payment being a "Payment Amount"), the Property Trustee shall and is directed, to the extent funds are available for that purpose, make a Pro Rata distribution of the Payment Amount to Holders, subject to Section 7.1(b).
          (d) Distributions on the Securities shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the register of the Trust as of the close of business on the relevant record dates. While the Capital Securities are represented by one or more Global Securities, the relevant record dates shall be the close of business the Business Day preceding such Distribution payment date; otherwise the relevant record date shall be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) preceding such Distribution payment date. At all times, the Distribution payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Debenture Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Debentures, shall cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with this Trust Agreement. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such payment date.
          (e) In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata among the Holders of the Securities except as provided in Section 7.1(b).
     SECTION 7.3. .
Redemption of Securities
          (a) Upon the repayment or redemption, in whole or in part, of the Debentures held by the Trust, whether at the stated maturity of the Debentures or upon earlier redemption as provided in the Indenture, the proceeds from such repayment or redemption shall be simultaneously applied Pro Rata (subject to Section 7.1(b)) to redeem Securities having an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so repaid or redeemed at the Redemption Price. Holders shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice of such redemption in accordance with Section 7.4.
          (b) On the date fixed for any distribution of Debentures, upon dissolution of the Trust, (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and (ii) certificates representing Securities will be deemed to represent the Debentures having an aggregate principal
 
amount equal to the stated liquidation amount of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest equal to accumulated and unpaid distributions on, such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Sponsor or its agent for transfer or reissuance.
     SECTION 7.4. .
Redemption Procedures
          (a) Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Debentures in exchange for, the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice"), which notice shall be irrevocable, will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Debentures. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 7.4(a), a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to Holders of Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the register of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
          (b) If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Common Securities and the Capital Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata (subject to Section 7.1(b)) and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be redeemed as described in Section 7.4(c) below. The particular Capital Securities to be redeemed will be selected on a Pro Rata basis by the Property Trustee from the outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption, by such method (including, without limitation, by lot) as the Property Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. The Trust may not redeem the Securities in part unless all accumulated and unpaid Distributions to the date of redemption have been paid in full on all Securities then outstanding. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate liquidation amount of Capital Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
          (c) Subject to the Trust's fulfillment of the notice requirements set forth in Section 7.4(a) above, if Securities are to be redeemed, then (i) with respect to Capital Securities represented by one or more Global Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided that the Debenture Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Depositary or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give the Depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities and (ii) with respect to Securities not represented by one or more Global Securities, provided that the Debenture Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Property Trustee will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities upon surrender of their certificates evidencing the Capital Securities. Payment
 
of the Redemption Price on the Capital Securities will be made to the recordholders thereof as they appear on the register of the Trust on the relevant record date, which shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant redemption date; that with respect to the Capital Securities not represented by one or more Global Securities, the relevant record date shall be the date fifteen days prior to the relevant redemption date. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If, however, the Business Day falls in the next calendar year, then payment of the Redemption Price will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is not paid because the payment of the Redemption Price on the Debentures is not made, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and, as a result, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accumulate at the then applicable rate from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price. For these purposes, the applicable Redemption Price shall not include Distributions which are being paid to Holders who were Holders on a relevant record date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited or paid as required, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit or payment, Distributions will cease to accumulate on the Securities called for redemption and all rights of Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price, and from and after the date fixed for redemption, such Securities will cease to be outstanding.
provided, however,
     Neither the Administrative Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been called for redemption, except in the case of any Securities being redeemed in part, any portion thereof not to be redeemed.
          (d) Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Debenture Issuer or its subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Capital Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.
     SECTION 7.5. .
Voting Rights of Capital Securities
          (a) Except as provided under Section 6.6, Section 11.1 and this Article 7 and as otherwise required by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the Trust Indenture Act and other applicable law, the Holders of the Capital Securities shall have no voting rights.
          (b) Subject to the requirement of the Property Trustee obtaining a tax opinion in certain circumstances set forth in Section 7.5(d) below, the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities voting separately as a class have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under the Trust Agreement, including the right to direct the Property Trustee, as Holder of the Debentures, to (i) exercise the remedies available to it under the Indenture as a Holder of
 
the Debentures; (ii) consent to any amendment or modification of the Indenture or the Debentures where such consent shall be required or (iii) waive any past default and its consequences that is waivable under Section 5.13 of the Indenture; provided, however, that if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then the Holders of 25% of the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities may direct the Property Trustee to declare the principal of and interest on the Debentures due and payable; provided, further, that where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of more than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Debentures affected thereby, only the Holders of the percentage of the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Capital Securities which is at least equal to the percentage required under the Indenture may direct the Property Trustee to give such consent to take such action.
          (c) If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures after a Holder of Capital Securities has made a written request, such Holder of Capital Securities may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, institute a legal proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Indenture without first instituting any legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other Person. In addition, if a Trust Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debenture Issuer to make any interest, principal or other required payments when due under the Indenture, then a Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a Direct Action against the Debenture Issuer on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures.
          (d) The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of any Indenture Event of Default received from the Debenture Issuer with respect to the Debentures. Such notice shall state that such Indenture Event of Default also constitutes a Trust Enforcement Event. Except with respect to directing the time, method, and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy, the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to take any of the actions described in clause 7.5(b)(i) and (ii) above unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such action.
          (e) In the event the consent of the Property Trustee, as the Holder of the Debentures, is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment or modification of the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall request the direction of the Holders of the Capital Securities with respect to such amendment or modification and shall vote with respect to such amendment or modification as directed by not less than a majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities voting together as a single class; provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of the Holders of more than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures, the Property Trustee may only give such consent at the direction of the Holders of at least the same proportion in aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Securities. The Property Trustee shall not take any such action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Securities unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such action.
 
          (f) A waiver of an Indenture Event of Default with respect to the Debentures will constitute a waiver of the corresponding Trust Enforcement Event.
          (g) Any required approval or direction of Holders of Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities or pursuant to written consent. The Administrative Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote to be mailed to each Holder of record of Capital Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies.
          (h) No vote or consent of the Holders of Capital Securities shall be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Capital Securities or distribute Debentures in accordance with this Trust Agreement and the terms of the Securities.
          (i) Notwithstanding that Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Securities that are owned at such time by the Debenture Issuer, any Administrative Trustee or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Debenture Issuer or any Administrative Trustee, shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if such Securities were not outstanding; , that Persons otherwise eligible to vote to whom the Debenture Issuer or any of its subsidiaries have pledged Capital Securities may vote or consent with respect to such pledged Capital Securities under any of the circumstances described herein.
provided, however
          (j) Subject to Sections 6.6(a) and 7.5(k), Holders of the Capital Securities shall have no rights to appoint or remove the Trustees, who may be appointed, removed or replaced solely by the Common Securities Holder.
          (k) If an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may be removed at such time only by a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities.
          (l) The Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of the Securities.
     SECTION 7.6. .
Voting Rights of Common Securities

Except with respect to directing the time, method, and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy, the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to take any of the actions described in clause 7.6(c)(i) and (ii) above unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect that, as a result of such action, for United States federal income tax purposes the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust.
          (d) If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures after a Holder of Common Securities has made a written request, such Holder of Common Securities may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, directly institute a legal proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Debentures without first instituting any legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other Person.
          (e) A waiver of an Indenture Event of Default with respect to the Debentures will constitute a waiver of the corresponding Trust Enforcement Event.

     SECTION 7.7. .
Paying Agent
     In the event that any Capital Securities are not in book-entry only form, the Trust shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, State of New York, an office or agency where the Capital Securities may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Trust may appoint the paying agent and may appoint one or more additional paying agents in such other locations as it shall determine. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Trust may change any Paying Agent without prior notice to the Holders. The Trust shall notify the Property Trustee of the name and address of any Paying Agent not a party to this Trust Agreement. If the Trust fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Paying Agent, the Property Trustee shall act as such. The Trust or any of its Affiliates may act as Paying Agent.

          (c) The Trust shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Property Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Trust shall provide for the registration of Capital Securities and of transfers of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Capital Securities and transfers of Capital Securities as herein provided.
 
          (d) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at an office or agency of the Trust designated for such purpose, the Trust shall execute, and the Property Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount.
          (e) At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency.

          (f) Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Trust or the Property Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trust and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
          (g) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Trust may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities.
          (h) If the Securities are to be redeemed in part, the Trust shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 7.4 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer or exchange of any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
     SECTION 7.10.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.
If:
     (a) any mutilated Certificates should be surrendered to the Administrative Trustees, or if the Administrative Trustees shall receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate; and
     (b) there shall be delivered to the Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to keep each of the Trustees, the Sponsor and the Trust harmless,
then, in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, any Administrative Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 7.10, the Administrative Trustees may require the payment of a sum sufficient to
 
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.
     SECTION 7.11. .
Deemed Security Holders
     The Trustees may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered on the register of the Trust as the sole holder of such Certificate and of the Securities represented by such Certificate for purposes of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such Certificate or in the Securities represented by such Certificate on the part of any Person, whether or not the Trust shall have actual or other notice thereof.
     SECTION 7.12. .
Global Securities
     On initial issuance, the Capital Securities shall be issued in definitive form to the Sponsor. Upon transfer by the Sponsor of the Capital Securities, the Capital Securities may be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities. If the Capital Securities are to be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities, then an Administrative Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and the Property Trustee shall authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of all of the Capital Securities to be issued in the form of Global Securities and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or the nominee of such Depositary, and (iii) shall be delivered by the Property Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions. Global Securities shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect:
"This Capital Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Trust Agreement hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (the "Depositary"), or a nominee of the Depositary. This Capital Security is exchangeable for Capital Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Trust Agreement and no transfer of this Capital Security (other than a transfer of this Capital Security as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary) may be registered except in limited circumstances.
Unless this Capital Security Certificate is presented by an authorized representative of the Depositary to USB Capital VII or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Capital Security Certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary (and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF
 
FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein."
     Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security issued in exchange for all or a part of a Global Security pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Property Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Property Trustee shall deliver such Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security to the Persons in whose names such definitive Capital Securities are so registered.
     At such time as all interests in Global Securities have been redeemed, repurchased or cancelled, such Global Securities shall be, upon receipt thereof, cancelled by the Property Trustee in accordance with standing procedures of the Depositary. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in Global Securities is exchanged for Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security, redeemed, cancelled or transferred to a transferee who receives Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security therefor or any Capital Security not represented by a Global Security is exchanged or transferred for part of Global Securities, the principal amount of such Global Securities shall, in accordance with the standing procedures of the Depositary, be reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Securities by the Property Trustee to reflect such reduction or increase.
     The Trust and the Property Trustee may for all purposes, including the making of payments due on the Capital Securities, deal with the Depositary as the authorized representative of the Holders for the purposes of exercising the rights of Holders hereunder. The rights of the owner of any beneficial interest in a Global Security shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such owners and depository participants provided, that no such agreement shall give any rights to any Person against the Trust or the Property Trustee without the written consent of the parties so affected. Multiple requests and directions from and votes of the Depositary as holder of Capital Securities in global form with respect to any particular matter shall not be deemed inconsistent to the extent they do not represent an amount of Capital Securities in excess of those held in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
     If at any time the Depositary for any Capital Securities represented by one or more Global Securities notifies the Trust that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Capital Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Capital Securities shall no longer be eligible under this Section 7.12, the Trust shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Capital Securities. If a successor Depositary for such Capital Securities is not appointed by the Trust within 90 days after the Trust receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Trust's election that such Capital Securities be represented by one or more Global Securities shall no longer be effective and the Trust shall execute, and the Property Trustee will authenticate and deliver, Capital Securities in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Capital Securities representing such Capital Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Capital Securities.
 
     The Trust may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Capital Securities issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security or Capital Securities. In such event the Trust shall execute, and the Property Trustee, shall authenticate and deliver, Capital Securities in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Capital Securities representing such Capital Securities, in exchange for such Global Security or Capital Securities.
     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement (other than the provisions set forth in Section 7.9), Global Securities may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred or exchanged for Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security and Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security may be transferred or exchange for Global Securities in accordance with rules of the Depositary and the provisions of Section 7.9.
     SECTION 8.1. .
Dissolution and Termination of Trust
          (a) The Trust shall dissolve upon the earliest of:
     (i) the bankruptcy of the Holder of the Common Securities or the Sponsor;
     (ii) the filing of a certificate of dissolution or its equivalent with respect to the Sponsor or the revocation of the Sponsor's charter and the expiration of 90 days after the revocation without a reinstatement thereof;
     (iii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Sponsor or the Trust;
     (iv) the time when all of the Securities shall have been called for redemption and the amounts then due shall have been paid to the Holders in accordance with the terms of the Securities;
     (v) at the Sponsor's election by notice and direction to the Property Trustee to distribute the Debentures to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for all of the Securities, subject to the receipt of any necessary approvals by the Federal Reserve that may then be required under the applicable capital guidelines or policies of the Federal Reserve; that the Sponsor will be required to obtain an opinion of an independent counsel that the distribution of the
provided
 
Debentures will not be taxable to the Holders of the Capital Securities for United States federal income tax purposes; or
     (vi) the time when all of the Administrative Trustees and the Sponsor shall have consented to dissolution of the Trust provided such action is taken before the issuance of any Securities.
          (b) As soon as is practicable after the occurrence of an event referred to in Section 8.1(a) and upon completion of the winding up and liquidation of the Trust, the Trustees shall terminate the Trust by filing a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
          (c) The provisions of Section 4.2 and Article 9 shall survive the termination of the Trust.
     SECTION 8.2. .
Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution of the Trust
          (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Trust (each a "Liquidation"), the Holders of the Securities on the date of the Liquidation will be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders of Securities after satisfaction of the Trust's liabilities to creditors, if any, distributions in cash or other immediately available funds in an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $25.00 per Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such Liquidation, Debentures in an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate identical to the distribution rate of, and accumulated and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities shall be distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.
          (b) If, upon any such Liquidation, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis. The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive distributions upon any such Liquidation Pro Rata with the Holders of the Capital Securities except that if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a preference over the Common Securities with regard to such distributions as provided for in Section 7.1(b).
 
     SECTION 9.1. .
Liability
          (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Trust Agreement, the Guarantee and the terms of the Securities, the Sponsor:
     (i) shall not be personally liable for the return of any portion of the capital contributions (or any return thereon) of the Holders of the Securities which shall be made solely from assets of the Trust; and
     (ii) shall not be required to pay to the Trust or to any Holder of Securities any deficit upon dissolution of the Trust or otherwise.
          (b) Pursuant to Section 3803(a) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the Holder of the Common Securities shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; provided, however, the Holders of the Common Securities shall be liable for all of the debts and obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to the Securities) to the extent not satisfied out of the Trust's assets.
          (c) Pursuant to Section 3803(a) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the Holders of the Capital Securities shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
     SECTION 9.2. .
Exculpation
          (a) No Indemnified Person shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Trust or any Covered Person for any loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Trust Agreement or by law, except that an Indemnified Person shall be liable for any such loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of such Indemnified Person's negligence or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions.
          (b) An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Trust and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Trust by any Person as to matters the Indemnified Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Trust, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses or any other facts
 
pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which Distributions to Holders of Securities might properly be paid.
     SECTION 9.3. .
Fiduciary Duty
          (a) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to any other Covered Person, an Indemnified Person acting under this Trust Agreement shall not be liable to the Trust or to another Covered Person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity (other than the duties imposed on the Property Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act), are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified Person.
          (b) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein:
     (i) whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between any Covered Person and any Indemnified Person; or
     (ii) whenever this Trust Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or therein provides that an Indemnified Person shall act in a manner that is, or provides terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Trust or any Holder of Securities,
the Indemnified Person shall resolve such conflict of interest, take such action or provide such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles. In the absence of bad faith by the Indemnified Person, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Indemnified Person shall not constitute a breach of this Trust Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or otherwise.
          (c) Whenever in this Trust Agreement an Indemnified Person is permitted or required to make a decision:
     (i) in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or
     (ii) in its "good faith" or under another express standard, the Indemnified Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Trust Agreement or by applicable law.
 
     SECTION 9.4. .
Indemnification
          (a) The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorney fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
          (b) The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
          (c) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Debenture Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Administrative Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
          (d) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4 shall be paid by the Debenture Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
 
undertaking by or on behalf of such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Debenture Issuer as authorized in this Section 9.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Debenture Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (1) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (3) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Administrative Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Administrative Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Capital Security Holders.
          (e) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 9.4 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Debenture Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 9.4 shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Debenture Issuer and each Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 9.4 is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 9.4 shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
          (f) The Debenture Issuer or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Debenture Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 9.4.
          (g) For purposes of this Section 9.4, references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 9.4 with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
          (h) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 9.4 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The obligation to
 
indemnify as set forth in this Section 9.4 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee or the termination of this Trust Agreement.
     SECTION 9.5. .
Outside Businesses
     Subject to the provisions of Section 6.3, any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Property Trustee may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the activities of the Trust, and the Trust and the Holders of Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Trust Agreement in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the activities of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. No Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Property Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person, the Delaware Trustee and the Property Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates.

Certain Accounting Matters
          (a) At all times during the existence of the Trust, the Administrative Trustees shall keep, or cause to be kept, full books of account, records and supporting documents, which shall reflect in reasonable detail, each transaction of the Trust. The books of account shall be maintained on the accrual method of accounting, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. The Trust shall use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. The books of account and the records of the Trust shall be examined by and reported upon as of the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust by a firm of independent certified public accountants selected by the Administrative Trustees.
          (b) The Administrative Trustees shall cause to be prepared and delivered to each of the Holders of Securities, within 90 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust, annual financial statements of the Trust, including a balance sheet of the Trust as of the end of such Fiscal Year, and the related statements of income or loss.
 
          (c) The Administrative Trustees shall cause to be duly prepared and delivered to each of the Holders of Securities, an annual United States federal income tax information statement, required by the Code, containing such information with regard to the Securities held by each Holder as is required by the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding any right under the Code to deliver any such statement at a later date, the Administrative Trustees shall endeavor to deliver all such statements within 30 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust.
          (d) The Administrative Trustees shall cause to be duly prepared and filed with the appropriate taxing authority, an annual United States federal income tax return, on a Form 1041 or such other form required by United States federal income tax law, and any other annual income tax returns required to be filed by the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust with any state or local taxing authority.

     The Trust shall maintain one or more bank accounts in the name and for the sole benefit of the Trust; provided, however, that all payments of funds in respect of the Debentures held by the Property Trustee shall be made directly to the Property Account and no other funds of the Trust shall be deposited in the Property Account. The sole signatories for such accounts shall be designated by the Administrative Trustees; provided, however, that the Property Trustee shall designate the signatories for the Property Account.
     SECTION 10.4. .
Withholding
     The Trust and the Administrative Trustees shall comply with all withholding requirements under United States federal, state and local law. The Trust shall request, and the Holders shall provide to the Trust, such forms or certificates as are necessary to establish an exemption from withholding with respect to each Holder, and any representations and forms as shall reasonably be requested by the Trust to assist it in determining the extent of, and in fulfilling, its withholding obligations. The Administrative Trustees shall file required forms with applicable jurisdictions and, unless an exemption from withholding is properly established by a Holder, shall remit amounts withheld with respect to the Holder to applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that the Trust is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any Holder, the amount withheld shall be deemed to be a distribution in the amount of the withholding to the Holder. In the event of any claimed over withholding, Holders shall be limited to an action against the applicable jurisdiction. If the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual Distributions made, the Trust may reduce subsequent Distributions by the amount of such withholding.

The Administrative Trustees shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class if directed to do so by the Holders of at least 10% in Liquidation Amount of such class of Securities. Such direction shall be given by delivering to the Administrative Trustees one or more calls in a writing stating that the signing Holders of Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purpose for which the meeting is to be called. Any Holders of Securities calling a meeting shall specify in writing the Certificates held by the Holders of Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and only those Securities specified shall be counted for purposes of determining whether the required percentage set forth in the second sentence of this paragraph has been met.
          (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the terms of the Securities, the following provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of Securities:
     (i) notice of any such meeting shall be given to all the Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereat at least 7 days and not more than 60 days before the date of such meeting.

Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Holders of Securities entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. The Administrative Trustees may specify that any written ballot submitted to the Security Holders for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Trust within the time specified by the Administrative Trustees;
 
     (ii) each Holder of a Security may authorize any Person to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Holder of Securities is entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Holder of Securities executing such proxy. Except as otherwise provided herein, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the Holders of the Securities were stockholders of a Delaware corporation;
     (iii) each meeting of the Holders of the Securities shall be conducted by the Administrative Trustees or by such other Person that the Administrative Trustees may designate; and
     (iv) unless the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, this Trust Agreement, the terms of the Securities, the Trust Indenture Act or the listing rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are then listed for trading, otherwise provides, the Administrative Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any Holders of Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.

Powers and Duties of Guarantee Trustee
          (a) This Guarantee shall be held by the Guarantee Trustee on behalf of the Trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities, and the Guarantee Trustee shall not transfer this Guarantee to any Person except a Holder of Securities exercising his or her rights pursuant to Section 5.4(b) or to a Successor Guarantee Trustee on acceptance by such Successor Guarantee Trustee of its appointment to act as Successor Guarantee Trustee. The right, title and interest of the Guarantee Trustee in and to this Guarantee shall automatically vest in any Successor Guarantee Trustee, and such vesting and succession of title shall be effective whether or not conveyance documents have been executed and delivered pursuant to the appointment of such Successor Guarantee Trustee.
          (b) If a Guarantee Event of Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Guarantee Trustee has occurred and is continuing, the Guarantee Trustee shall enforce this Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities.
          (c) The Guarantee Trustee, before the occurrence of any Guarantee Event of Default and after the curing of all Guarantee Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Guarantee, and no implied covenants shall be read into this Guarantee against the Guarantee Trustee. In case a Guarantee Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 2.6) and is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Guarantee Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Guarantee, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
          (d) No provision of this Guarantee shall be construed to relieve the Guarantee Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
     (i) prior to the occurrence of any Guarantee Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Guarantee Events of Default that may have occurred:
 
     (ii) the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Guarantee Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Guarantee Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts upon which such judgment was made;
     (iii) the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Guarantee Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under this Guarantee; and
     (iv) no provision of this Guarantee shall require the Guarantee Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Guarantee Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Guarantee or if the Guarantee Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that an indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to the Guarantee Trustee, against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Guarantee.
     SECTION 3.2. . (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1:
Certain Rights of Guarantee Trustee

     (iv) The Guarantee Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration or any instrument (or any rerecording, refiling or re-registration thereof);

Such counsel may be counsel to the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates and may include any of its employees. The Guarantee Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Guarantee from any court of competent jurisdiction;
     (vi) The Guarantee Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Guarantee at the request or direction of any Holder, unless such Holder shall have provided to the Guarantee Trustee such security and indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to the Guarantee Trustee, against the costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses and the expenses of the Guarantee Trustee's agents, nominees or custodians) and liabilities that might be incurred by it in complying with such request or direction, including such reasonable advances as may be requested by the Guarantee Trustee; provided, that nothing contained in this Section 3.2(a)(vi) shall be taken to relieve the Guarantee Trustee, upon the occurrence of a Guarantee Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Guarantee;

     (ix) Any action taken by the Guarantee Trustee or its agents hereunder shall bind the Holders, and the signature of the Guarantee Trustee or its agents alone shall be sufficient and effective to perform any such action. No third party shall be required to inquire as to the authority of the Guarantee Trustee to so act or as to its compliance with any of the terms and provisions of this Guarantee, both of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the Guarantee Trustee's or its agent's taking such action; and
     (x) Whenever in the administration of this Guarantee, the Guarantee Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder, the Guarantee Trustee (i) may request written instructions from the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Securities, (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such written instructions are received and (iii) shall be protected in conclusively relying on or acting in accordance with such written instructions.
          (b) No provision of this Guarantee shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on the Guarantee Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Guarantee Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent to act in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation.

     SECTION 6.3. .
Subordination of Common Securities
