(c) Exhibits.
     99.1 Press Release issued by U.S. Bancorp on October 18, 2005, deemed "filed" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
     DATE: October 18, 2005

 
Exhibit 99.1
     (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $1,154 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $1,066 million for the third quarter of 2004. Net income of $.62 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005 was higher than the same period of 2004 by $.06 (10.7 percent). Return on average assets and return on average equity were 2.23 percent and 22.8 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2005, compared with returns of 2.21 percent and 21.9 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2004.
MINNEAPOLIS, October 18, 2005  U.S. Bancorp
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "Our third quarter results were solid. Once again, we achieved record profitability, with earnings per diluted share increasing by 10.7 percent over the third quarter of 2004. We maintained our industry leading performance metrics of 2.23 percent return on assets and 22.8 percent return on equity and created
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2005 Results October 18, 2005 Page 2
positive operating leverage over the same quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2005. In today's economic environment the low cost provider has a distinct advantage and we certainly demonstrated that we have that advantage in our industry with a tangible efficiency ratio of 40 percent in the third quarter. Finally, we returned 87 percent of our earnings in the quarter to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
     "Average loans outstanding in the third quarter rose by a healthy 10.1 percent year-over-year and at an annualized growth rate of 12.4 percent over the second quarter of 2005. Net interest income increased slightly over the same quarter of 2004, despite a decline in the net interest margin. Net interest income increased at an annualized rate of 6.8 percent over the second quarter of 2005. Our fee-based businesses continued to grow, increasing by 9.7 percent over the third quarter of 2004. Fee income growth was led by our payment services-related businesses and deposit service charges, which grew year-over-year by 15.6 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively.
     "Credit quality remained stable again this quarter with total net charge-offs at just .46 percent of total average loans. In addition, nonperforming assets at the end of the quarter remained steady at $613 million. This is a direct result of our continuing commitment to reduce the overall risk profile of our Company.
     "We are delivering on our promise to maintain industry leading returns, while producing stable, high-quality revenue and earnings. We will continue to invest in distribution and scale to provide future growth opportunities, while striving to continuously improve our customer service. Further, since we began the current buyback program in the fourth quarter of 2003, we have returned 102 percent of our earnings to our shareholders, and we expect to continue to return a minimum of 80 percent going forward."
     The Company's results for the third quarter of 2005 improved over the same period of 2004, as net income rose by $88 million (8.3 percent), primarily due to growth in fee-based products and services and reduced credit costs. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $3 million of reparation in its mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") asset, compared with an $87 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2004, due to changing longer-term interest rates. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2005 was $61 million (1.8 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting 9.7 percent growth in fee-based revenue across the majority of fee categories and expansion in payment processing businesses. This was

partially offset by an $87 million unfavorable variance in securities gains (losses) due to gains recognized in the third quarter of 2004.
     Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2005 was $45 million (3.0 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting the $90 million favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, offset somewhat by incremental costs related to expanding the payment processing businesses and investments in in-store branches, affordable housing projects and other business initiatives.
     Provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2005 was $145 million, a decrease of $21 million (12.7 percent) from the third quarter of 2004. The decrease in the provision for credit losses year-over-year reflected a decrease in total net charge-offs. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2005 were $156 million, compared with the second quarter of 2005 net charge-offs of $144 million and the third quarter of 2004 net charge-offs of $166 million. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2005 included a $12 million charge-off of a leveraged lease of a single airline entering bankruptcy during the quarter. This airline exposure was specifically considered in the Company's allowance for credit losses in prior periods and reflects the continuing weakness in the airline and transportation industries. Total nonperforming assets were $613 million at September 30, 2005, relatively flat compared with $610 million at June 30, 2005, and a $192 million (23.9 percent) decline compared with $805 million at September 30, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 438 percent at September 30, 2005, compared with 441 percent at June 30, 2005, and 337 percent at September 30, 2004.

Net Interest Income
     Third quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,791 million, compared with $1,782 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004. Average earning assets for the period increased over the third quarter of 2004 by $12.3 billion (7.3 percent), primarily driven by a $4.2 billion (28.6 percent) increase in residential mortgages, a $3.9 billion (10.0 percent) increase in total commercial loans and a $3.3 billion (7.8 percent) increase in total retail loans. The positive impact to net interest income from the growth in earning assets was offset somewhat by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin in the third quarter of 2005 was 3.95 percent, compared with 4.22 percent in the third quarter of 2004. The decline in the net interest margin reflected the current lending environment, asset/liability management decisions and the impact of changes in the yield curve from a year ago. Since the third quarter of 2004, credit spreads have tightened by approximately 19 basis points across most lending products due to competitive pricing, growth in corporate payment card balances and a change in mix due to growth in lower-spread, fixed-rate credit products. The net interest margin also declined due to funding incremental growth with higher cost wholesale funding and asset/liability decisions designed to minimize the Company's rate sensitivity position, including a 55 percent reduction in the net receive fixed swap position since

September 30, 2004. Increases in the margin benefit of deposits and net free funds helped to partially offset these factors.
     Net interest income in the third quarter of 2005 was higher than the second quarter of 2005 by $30 million (1.7 percent). Average earning assets grew quarter-over-quarter by $3.7 billion (2.1 percent). Growth in most loan categories drove the increase in average earning assets over the prior quarter. The positive impact to net interest income from the growth in earning assets and day basis was partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin in the third quarter of 2005 was 4 basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.99 percent recorded in the second quarter of 2005. The decline in the net interest margin from the second quarter of 2005 reflected tighter credit spreads (3 basis points) due to increased competition, in addition to growth in corporate payment card balances and changes in loan mix. Higher short-term rates and funding a higher percentage of earning asset growth with wholesale funding also contributed to the margin reduction. This was partially offset by the higher margin benefit of deposits and net free funds and loan fees.

     Average loans for the third quarter of 2005 were $12.4 billion (10.1 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2004, driven by growth in average residential mortgages of $4.2 billion (28.6 percent) total commercial loans of $3.9 billion (10.0 percent) and total retail loans of $3.3 billion (7.8 percent). Total commercial real estate loans also increased year-over-year by $1.0 billion (3.7 percent). Average loans for the third quarter of 2005 were higher than the second quarter of 2005 by $4.0 billion (3.1 percent), reflecting growth in substantially all loan categories.
     Average investment securities in the third quarter of 2005 were $720 million (1.7 percent) lower than in the third quarter of 2004. Investment securities at September 30, 2005, were $1.9 billion higher than at September 30, 2004, but $783 million lower than the balance at June 30, 2005. The changes in the balance of the investment securities portfolio from a year ago principally reflected the net impact of repositioning the investment portfolio during 2004 as part of asset/liability risk management decisions to acquire variable-rate and shorter-term fixed-rate securities to minimize the Company's rate sensitivity position. The decline from second quarter of

2005 primarily represented maturities and prepayments with the proceeds being utilized to partially fund loan growth. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company maintained a mix of approximately 41 percent variable-rate securities.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2005 were lower than the third quarter of 2004 by $357 million (1.2 percent). The year-over-year change in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits was impacted by product changes in the Consumer Banking business line. In late 2004, the Company migrated approximately $1.3 billion of noninterest-bearing deposit balances to interest checking accounts as an enhancement to its Silver Elite Checking product. Average branch-based noninterest-bearing deposits in the third quarter of 2005, excluding the migration of certain high-value customers to Silver Elite Checking, were higher by approximately $120 million (1.0 percent) over the same quarter of 2004, as net new checking accounts continue to grow. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in other areas, including commercial banking and Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, also increased year-over-year. These favorable variances were offset somewhat by expected declines in average noninterest-bearing deposits in corporate banking as these customers utilize their excess liquidity.

     Average total savings products declined year-over-year by $1.1 billion (1.9 percent), due to reductions in average money market account balances and savings accounts, partially offset by higher interest checking balances. Average branch-based interest checking deposits increased by $2.3 billion (15.2 percent) over the same quarter of 2004 due to strong new account growth, as well as the $1.3 billion migration of the Silver Elite Checking product. This positive variance in branch-based interest checking account deposits was partially offset by reductions in other areas, principally corporate banking. Average money market account balances declined by $3.1 billion (9.8 percent) year-over-year, with the largest decline in the branches. The overall decrease in average money market account balances year-over-year was the result of the Company's deposit pricing decisions. A portion of the money market balances have migrated to time deposits greater than $100,000 as rates increased on the time deposit products.
     Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were higher in the third quarter of 2005 than the third quarter of 2004 by $394 million (3.1 percent). The Company experienced year-over-year growth in average time deposits greater than $100,000 of $6.7 billion (46.3 percent), most notably in corporate banking, as customers migrated balances to higher rate deposits.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2005 were $286 million (1.0 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2005. Average savings products declined by $1.4 billion (2.5 percent) in the current quarter from the second quarter of 2005. Average interest checking deposits declined $516 million (2.2 percent) primarily due to lower balances from corporate banking customers. Average money market account balances declined by $823 million (2.8 percent) reflecting customers' preference for higher yielding products. Time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 increased modestly from the second quarter of 2005, while time deposits greater than $100,000 rose by $803 million (3.9 percent), primarily due to the migration of corporate banking customer balances to these products.

Noninterest Income
     Third quarter noninterest income was $1,576 million, an increase of $52 million (3.4 percent) from the same quarter of 2004, and $35 million (2.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2005. The increase in noninterest income over the third quarter of 2004 was driven by favorable variances in the majority of fee income categories, partially offset by an $87 million reduction in securities gains (losses). Credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue were both higher in the third quarter of 2005 than the third quarter of 2004 by $21 million and $27 million, or 12.8 percent and 25.0 percent, respectively. The growth in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes and rate changes. The corporate payment products revenue growth reflected growth in sales, card usage, rate changes and the recent acquisition of a small fleet card business. ATM processing services revenue was higher by $19 million (42.2 percent) in the third quarter of 2005 than the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the expansion of the ATM business in May of 2005. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in the third quarter of 2005 than the same quarter of 2004 by $12 million (6.4 percent), reflecting an increase in sales volume, new business and higher equipment fees. Trust and investment management fees were

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2005 Results October 18, 2005 Page 11
higher by $11 million (4.6 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to improved equity market conditions and account growth. Deposit service charges were higher year-over-year by $38 million (18.3 percent) due to account growth and transaction-related fees. Mortgage banking revenue was higher in the third quarter of 2005 than the same quarter of 2004 by $14 million (14.4 percent), due to higher production volumes and increased servicing income. Other income was higher by $9 million (7.2 percent), primarily due to higher income from equity and other insurance investments relative to the same quarter of 2004Partially offsetting these positive variances, year-over-year, were reductions in treasury management fees and commercial products revenue, which declined by $9 million (7.6 percent) and $3 million (2.8 percent), respectively. The decrease in treasury management fees was primarily due to higher earnings credit on customers' compensating balances relative to a year ago, reflecting rising interest rates. Commercial products revenue declined due to reductions in loan fees and international product revenue.
.
     Noninterest income was higher in the third quarter of 2005 than the second quarter of 2005 by $35 million (2.3 percent), due to increases in a majority of the fee income categories. Credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue rose by $8 million (4.5 percent) and $15 million (12.5 percent), respectively, reflecting higher sales volumes. ATM processing services revenue increased by $7 million (12.3 percent) primarily due to the acquisition of a processing business in the second quarter of 2005. Deposit service charges were higher by $12 million (5.1 percent) in the third quarter of 2005 compared with the second quarter of 2005, reflecting higher transaction-related fees and net new account growth. Offsetting these favorable variances was a decrease in treasury management fees from the second quarter of 2005. The $8 million (6.8 percent) decline in treasury management fees reflected seasonal tax-related processing revenue in the second quarter of 2005.

Noninterest Expense
     Third quarter noninterest expense totaled $1,473 million, a decrease of $45 million (3.0 percent) from the same quarter of 2004 and a $122 million (7.6 percent) decrease from the second quarter of 2005. The decrease in expense year-over-year was primarily driven by the $90 million favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Compensation expense was higher year-over-year by $39 million (6.9 percent), principally due to business expansion, including in-store branches, the Company's payment processing businesses, and other growth initiatives. Employee benefits increased year-over-year by $6 million (6.0 percent), primarily as a result of higher payroll taxes. Professional services expense increased $7 million (18.9 percent) due to increases in legal, and other professional services related to business initiatives, technology development, and the integration of specific payment processing businesses. Technology and communications expense rose by $8 million (7.3 percent), reflecting technology investments that increased software expense, in addition to outside data processing expense. Other expense declined in the third quarter from the same quarter of 2004 by $21 million (10.0 percent), primarily due to lower litigation costs, operating losses and business integration costs related to payment processing businesses relative to a year ago.

     Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2005 was lower than the second quarter of 2005 by $122 million (7.6 percent). The decrease in noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2005 was primarily driven by a $56 million favorable change in the MSR valuation quarter-over-quarter, as well as a $54 million charge taken in connection with the Company's tender offer for certain debt securities in the second quarter of 2005. In addition, compensation expense was lower than the second quarter of 2005 by $9 million (1.5 percent), primarily due to lower incentives and stock-based compensation costs. Marketing and business development expense declined $6 million (9.0 percent) reflecting the timing of marketing programs and a decline in charitable contributions. Other expense declined in the third quarter from the second quarter of 2005 by $9 million (4.5 percent), primarily due to a reduction in write-downs associated with certain co-branding and lease arrangements recorded in the second quarter of 2005. Partially offsetting these favorable changes in noninterest expense were higher occupancy costs, professional services expense and technology costs. Professional services expense increased by $5 million (12.8 percent) as compared to the second quarter of 2005 due to integration and other business initiatives. Technology and communications expense rose by $5 million (4.4 percent) relative to the prior quarter primarily due to processing costs associated with recent acquisitions and business investments.

Credit Quality
     The allowance for credit losses was $2,258 million at September 30, 2005, compared with $2,269 million at June 30, 2005, and $2,370 million at September 30, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 1.65 percent at September 30, 2005, compared with 1.70 percent at June 30, 2005, and 1.90 percent at September 30, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 438 percent at September 30, 2005, compared with 441 percent at June 30, 2005, and 337 percent at September 30, 2004. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2005 were $156 million, compared with the second quarter of 2005 net charge-offs of $144 million and the third quarter of 2004 net charge-offs of $166 million.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $23 million for the third quarter of 2005, or .13 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $13 million, or .07 percent of average loans outstanding, in the second quarter of 2005 and $27 million, or .16 percent of average loans outstanding, in the third quarter of 2004. The increase in net charge-offs reflected a $12 million charge-off of a leveraged lease of a single airline entering bankruptcy during the quarter.
     Retail loan net charge-offs of $124 million in the third quarter of 2005 were virtually flat as compared to the $123 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $8 million (6.1 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2004. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were 1.09 percent in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 1.12 percent and 1.26 percent in the second quarter of 2005 and third quarter of 2004, respectively. Lower levels of retail loan net charge-offs principally reflected the Company's ongoing improvement in collection efforts and risk management.

     Total shareholders' equity was $19.9 billion at September 30, 2005, compared with $19.6 billion at September 30, 2004. The increase was the result of corporate earnings offset by share buybacks and dividends.
     Tangible common equity to assets was 6.2 percent at September 30, 2005, compared with 6.1 percent at June 30, 2005, and 6.4 percent at September 30, 2004.

Lines of Business
     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business, which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is available and is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. During 2005, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results have been restated and presented on a comparable basis.

     Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking contributed $259 million of the Company's net income in the third quarter of 2005, a 4.0 percent increase over the same period of 2004 and a 2.6 percent decrease from the second quarter of 2005. The increase in Wholesale Banking's third quarter 2005 contribution over the same quarter of 2004 was primarily the result of favorable variances in total net revenue (3.2 percent) and total noninterest expense (1.9 percent). Partly offsetting these positive variances was a reduction in net recoveries (66.7 percent) reflected in the provision for credit losses. The favorable variance in total net revenue year-over-year was primarily the result of growth in net interest income (5.9 percent), as the business line's noninterest income declined slightly. The increase in net interest income was driven by growth in average loans and deposits outstanding and wider deposit spreads, partially offset by tighter credit spreads. Total noninterest income declined $4 million year-over-year, as a decline in treasury management fees (6.1 percent) was somewhat offset by higher commercial products revenue and other revenue relative to the third quarter of 2004. The decrease in treasury management fees was primarily due to higher earnings credit on customers' compensating balances relative to a year ago, reflecting rising interest rates. Wholesale Banking's favorable variance in total noninterest expense year-over-year was the result of lower net shared services and other noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in compensation and employee benefits. Net recoveries of $4 million in the current quarter, compared with net recoveries of $12 million in the third quarter of 2004, drove the unfavorable variance in the provision for credit losses year-over-year. The decrease in Wholesale Banking's contribution to net income in the third quarter of 2005 from the second quarter of 2005 was the result of unfavorable variances in total net revenue (1.1 percent) and the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in total noninterest expense (3.8 percent). Total net revenue was lower on a linked quarter basis primarily due to tightening credit spreads, partially offset by the benefit from wider deposit spreads. The decrease in noninterest income on a linked quarter basis was primarily due to a decrease in treasury management fees (8.3 percent), which reflected seasonal tax-related processing revenue in the second quarter of 2005, and a decline in income related to equity investments. The decrease in total noninterest expense was principally due to lower net shared services expense related to transaction volumes for the seasonal tax receipt processing activities and other expense. Net recoveries of $4 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared

with net recoveries of $16 million in the second quarter of 2005, drove the unfavorable variance in the provision for credit losses quarter-over-quarter.
     Consumer Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail and ATMs. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, in-store banking, small business banking, including lending guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, small-ticket leasing, consumer lending, mortgage banking, consumer finance, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking, and investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking contributed $473 million of the Company's net income in the third quarter of 2005, a 23.2 percent increase over the same period of 2004 and a 4.2 percent increase over the prior quarter. The favorable increase year-over-year was the result of higher total net revenue (10.4 percent) and lower provision for credit losses (18.2 percent), partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (3.0 percent). Total net revenue was higher than the same quarter of 2004 due to increases in both net interest income (9.8 percent) and noninterest income (11.5 percent). Net interest income was higher year-over-year due to wider deposit spreads. Net interest income generated by growth in average loan balances was substantially offset by lower spreads on those assets given the competitive lending environment. Noninterest income improved in the third quarter of 2005 over the same period of 2004, principally due to growth in deposit service charges (18.4 percent) and mortgage banking revenue (14.3 percent). Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2005 was higher than the same quarter of 2004, primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits (6.5 percent), the result of the Company's in-store branch expansion, other hiring initiatives and production-based incentives. A year-over-year reduction in net charge-offs (18.2 percent) drove the positive variance in the business line's provision for credit losses.
     The increase in Consumer Banking's contribution in the third quarter of 2005 over the prior quarter was the net result of favorable variances in total net revenue (3.0 percent), partly offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (1.5 percent) and provision for credit losses (5.9 percent). Net interest income was higher quarter-over-quarter largely due to increases in average loans outstanding and deposit spreads relative to the prior quarter, which were partly offset by lower credit spreads. Noninterest income was higher (4.6 percent) than the prior quarter primarily due to growth in deposit service charges and other revenue. The unfavorable variance in total noninterest expense quarter-over-quarter was driven by an increase in marketing and business development expense. A

5.9 percent increase in net charge-offs quarter-over-quarter drove the unfavorable variance in the provision for credit losses.
     Private Client, Trust and Asset Management provides trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund servicing through five businesses: Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Asset Management, Institutional Trust and Custody and Fund Services. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed $123 million of the Company's net income in the third quarter of 2005, 28.1 percent higher than the same period of 2004 and 5.1 percent higher than the prior quarter of 2005. The increase in the business line's contribution in the third quarter of 2005 over the same quarter of 2004 was the result of favorable variances in total net revenue (11.9 percent). Total noninterest expense remained relatively flat year-over-year. Net interest income was favorably impacted year-over-year by wider deposit spreads and growth in deposit balances. Noninterest income increased by 7.0 percent from the same quarter of 2004, primarily due to improved equity market conditions and account growth. The business line's contribution in the third quarter of 2005 increased 5.1 percent as compared with the prior quarter, with total net revenue slightly higher (1.6 percent) and total noninterest expense and provision for credit losses remaining relatively flat.
     Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $207 million of the Company's net income in the third quarter of 2005, a 25.5 percent increase over the same period of 2004 and a 13.7 percent increase over the second quarter of 2005. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the third quarter of 2005 over the same period of 2004 was the result of higher total net revenue (14.8 percent) and a slightly lower provision for credit losses (2.2 percent), partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (11.0 percent). The increase in total net revenue year-over-year was due to growth in total noninterest income (16.3 percent) and net interest income (9.6 percent), reflecting growth in higher yielding retail loan balances, offset by increases in corporate card balances and rebates. The increase in noninterest income was principally the result of growth in credit and debit card revenue (13.5 percent), corporate payment products revenue (25.0 percent), ATM processing services revenue (63.3 percent) and merchant processing services revenue (6.4 percent). All categories benefited from higher transaction volumes, rate changes and business expansion initiatives. The growth in total noninterest expense year-over-year primarily reflected an increase in processing

expense related to the business line's revenue growth, including costs associated with smaller Payment Services acquisitions. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the third quarter of 2005 over the prior quarter was primarily due to seasonally strong growth in total net revenue (7.4 percent), and lower provision for credit losses (4.3 percent), partly offset by higher total noninterest expense (5.0 percent). Net interest income increased 13.8 percent quarter-over-quarter, and fee-based revenue rose by 5.9 percent due to seasonally higher retail and corporate credit card sales volumes, ATM processing services revenue and merchant processing fees. The unfavorable variance in total noninterest expense from the prior quarter was primarily due to personnel and other costs to support ongoing business expansion and marketing programs.
     Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. In addition, changes in MSR valuations primarily due to interest rates are managed at a corporate level and, as such, reported within this business unit. Operational expenses incurred by Treasury and Corporate Support on behalf of the other business lines are allocated back to the appropriate business unit, primarily based on customer transaction volume and account activities, deposit balances and employee levels and are identified as net shared services expense. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net income of $92 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $172 million in the third quarter of 2004 and $102 million in the second quarter of 2005. The change in net income in the current quarter from the same quarter of 2004 was the net result of the unfavorable change in net interest income (60.5 percent) reflecting the Company's asset/liability management decisions, including higher-cost fixed funding and repositioning of the Company for changes in the interest rate environment, and the $86 million unfavorable change in net securities gains (losses), partially offset by favorable variances in the MSR valuation ($90 million) and debt prepayment expense ($5 million). Net income in the third quarter of 2005 was lower than net income in the second quarter of 2005, the result of the $94 million tax benefit realized in the second quarter of 2005, offset by a favorable MSR valuation ($56 million) and the second quarter of 2005 debt prepayment expense ($54 million). Total net interest income declined quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the continuing asset/liability management decisions of the Company.
