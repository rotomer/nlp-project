ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On December 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors adopted the final versions of the U.S. Bancorp 2005 Outside Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and the U.S. Bancorp 2005 Executive Employees Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plans"). The Plans were established in December 2004 under the terms contained in the Plan documents finally approved by the Compensation Committee in December 2005. The provisions of the Plans are substantially similar to those of the U.S. Bancorp Outside Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and the U.S. Bancorp Executive Employees Deferred Compensation Plan that were in effect until December 2004, with the primary changes being those required to comply with the American Jobs Creation Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
The Plans are included in this filing as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and are incorporated herein by reference. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Plans.

.
     (b) In the case of a Director's Plan Year in which such Director is first eligible to become a Participant in the Plan and has never participated in any other plan required to be aggregated with this Plan with respect to such Director under Code Section 409A and the applicable provisions of the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder, within thirty (30) days after the earliest date designated by the Board or Committee as of which such Director is first eligible to become a Participant in the Plan, each such Director, in lieu of making a deferral election in accordance with Section 3.1(a), may irrevocably elect by completing and executing an appropriate Deferred Compensation Agreement and delivering it to the Committee (or its designee), to defer (a "deferral election") under the Plan any portion up to 100% of the portion of such Director's Eligible Director's Compensation for services performed immediately after the effective date of his or her deferral election to the end of the Plan Year.

3.2
Effective Date of Deferral

     For purposes of the Plan, the Company shall cause a separate Deferred Compensation Account to be established in the name of each Participant. Each Prior Plan Participant shall receive a credit to such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account at the beginning of January 1, 2005 equal to the sum of the amounts credited to such Participant's accounts under each Prior Plan on December 31, 2004 and such amounts shall be thereafter adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 and administered in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The Deferrals of a Participant shall be credited to such Participant Deferred Compensation Account as soon as administratively feasible on or after the date such Deferrals would have otherwise been paid to such Participant if they were not deferred. All amounts credited to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be adjusted in the manner determined under Section 4.2.
4.1
Establishment of Deferred Compensation Accounts
.
     In accordance with, and subject to, the rules and procedures that are established from time to time by the Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be adjusted in accordance with the following rules:
4.2
Crediting/Debiting of Account
.
     (a) . Each Director or Prior Plan Participant shall elect on his or her Deferred Compensation Agreement or such other form designated by the Committee (or its designee) for such purpose the Measurement Fund(s) that will be used to determine the adjustment amounts to be credited to or debited from his or her Deferred Compensation Account for the applicable Plan Year or portion thereof in which the Director or Prior Plan Participant commences participation in the Plan and continuing thereafter for each subsequent Plan Year in which such Director or Participant participates in the Plan, unless changed in accordance with the next sentence. Commencing with the first calendar quarter beginning after a Participant's commencement of participation in the Plan and continuing thereafter for each calendar quarter in which the Participant participates in the Plan, but no later than the last Valuation Date in the applicable calendar quarter, the Participant may (but is not required to) elect, by submitting such election on a form designated by the Committee (or its designee) for such purpose to the Committee (or its designee) that is accepted and approved by the Committee (or its designee) or in such other manner required by the Committee (or its designee), to change the Measurement Fund(s) to be used to determine the adjustment amounts to be credited to or debited from such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account. If an election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, it shall apply no later than the Valuation Date immediately following the date of receipt
Election of Measurement Funds
 
and approval by the Committee (or its designee) and shall continue thereafter for each subsequent calendar quarter in which the Participant participates in the Plan, unless changed in accordance with the previous sentence.
     (b) Any election under Section 4.2(a) above shall result in 100% of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance being allocated among the Measurement Fund(s) elected by the Participant as if the Participant was making an actual investment in the Measurement Fund(s) equal to the portion of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance allocated to such Measurement Fund(s).
Proportionate Allocation
.
     (c) A Participant must elect at least one of the Measurement Funds described in Appendix B for the purpose of determining the manner in which such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance is to be adjusted. The Measurement Funds established by the Committee (or its designee) and described in Appendix B shall include a Company stock fund, which will be invested in Shares, mutual funds selected and approved by the Committee (or its designee) and a money market fund selected and approved by the Committee (or its designee). The Committee (or its designee) shall duly consider, but is not required to approve, the Participant's requested election of the Measurement Fund or Funds or the Participant's requested change in the Measurement Fund or Funds. In all events, the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be determined by reference to such Measurement Fund(s) as the Committee (or its designee) shall have selected from time to time with respect to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance. As necessary, the Committee (or its designee) may, in its sole discretion, discontinue, substitute or add a Measurement Fund(s). Each such action will take effect as of the earliest Valuation Date that follows by at least 30 days the date as of which the Committee (or its designee) gives Participants advance written notice of such change unless the Committee (or its designee) determines circumstances warrant a shorter advance notice.
Measurement Funds
.
     (d) The performance of the elected Measurement Fund(s) (either positive or negative) will be determined by the Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, based on the performance of the Measurement Fund(s) itself (taken into account the reinvestment of dividends, capital gains and interest income distributions therefrom). A Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be debited or credited as of the end of each Valuation Date, based on the performance of the applicable Measurement Fund(s) (at the closing price on such Valuation Date) selected by the Participant, as determined by the Committee (or its designee) in its sole discretion, as though (i) the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance was invested in the Measurement Fund(s) in the manner selected by the Participant and in effect as of the end of each such Valuation Date (at the closing price on such Valuation Date); (ii) any Deferrals and any other amounts credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account on that Valuation Date were invested in the Measurement Fund(s) (at the closing price on such Valuation Date) selected by the Participant and in effect as of the end of that Valuation Date; and (iii) any distribution made to a Participant that decreases such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance ceased to be invested in the applicable Measurement Fund(s) (at the closing
Crediting or Debiting Method
.
 
price on such Valuation Date) as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date as of which such distribution occurred.
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Measurement Funds are to be used for measurement purposes only, and a Participant's election or deemed election of any such Measurement Fund(s), the allocation of his or her Deferred Compensation Account Balance thereto, the calculation of adjustment amounts and the crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance in any such Measurement Fund. If the Company decides to invest funds in any or all of the Measurement Funds, no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments themselves. Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall at all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on such Participant's behalf by the Company. The Participants shall, at all times, remain unsecured creditors of the Company.
No Actual Investments
.
 
     Except as otherwise provided in this Article V, the Deferred Compensation Account Balance of a Participant shall be payable to such Participant (or, in the case of the death of a Participant, his Beneficiary) in the manner determined under Section 5.5.
5.1
In General
.
     At any time before payment in full of amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation Account of a Participant, the Participant may submit a written request to the Committee (or its designee) for the distribution of all or a portion of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance because of a Financial Hardship. Any such request must show sufficient facts as are necessary to establish that a Financial Hardship with respect to such Participant has occurred. If the Committee (or its designee) grants such request, (a) the Committee (or its designee) shall cancel the Participant's deferral election under Section 3.1 for the remaining part of the Plan Year in which a payment under this Section 5.2 was made as a result of such Financial Hardship and (b) the amounts distributed with respect to such Financial Hardship shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such Financial Hardship (which shall include amounts necessary to pay Federal, state and local income taxes and penalties reasonably anticipated from the distribution), after taking into account the extent to which such Financial Hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by cessation of such Participant's deferral election under this Section 5.2. Any payment made under this Section 5.2 shall be made in a lump sum as of the date on which such Financial Hardship occurs and shall be subject to the requirements and limitations of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) and the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder.
5.2
Hardship Distributions
.
     If the Committee (or its designee) determines, in its discretion, that a payment under the Plan is to be made to a minor, a person declared incompetent or to a person incapable of handling his or her property, the Committee (or its designee) may direct such payment to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent or incapable person. The Committee (or its designee) may require proof of minority, incompetence, incapacity or guardianship, as it may
5.3
Distributions to Incompetents
.
 
deem appropriate prior to making such payment. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of the Participant and a Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan for such payment amount.
     The Committee (or its designee) is authorized to make any payments required by a domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)) to an individual other than the Participant who is the subject of such order at the time and in the manner necessary to fulfill such order.
5.4
Court Ordered Distributions
.
     Each Participant shall elect (a "distribution election") the manner in which his or her Deferred Compensation Account Balance attributable to each Plan Year's Deferrals under this Plan will be distributed to him or her at the time he or she makes a deferral election under Section 3.1. Any such distribution election shall be irrevocable after it is made and approved by the Committee (or its designee) and shall apply only to Deferrals for the Plan Year for which such deferral election was made. A Participant may elect among the following forms of payment: a lump sum or annual installments over a five (5)-year, ten (10)-year, fifteen (15)-year or twenty (20)-year period. Unless otherwise elected by a Participant in the Deferred Compensation Agreement for the applicable Plan Year and approved by the Committee (or its designee) and unless otherwise described below, distributions of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be made as of his Benefit Commencement Date in a lump sum in cash or in property consisting of the Measurement Fund(s) most recently approved to be used for determining the amounts to be credited or debited from such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account, as elected by the Participant and approved by the Committee (or its designee). If a Participant dies before payment of any amounts payable under the Plan with respect to him or her commences, such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be paid in a lump sum to such Participant's Beneficiary as of the first Valuation Date following the Committee's (or its designee's) receipt of sufficient notice of such Participant's death. If a Participant dies after payment of any portion of amounts payable under the Plan with respect to him or her commences but before all amounts payable under the Plan with respect to him or her have been paid, any such remaining amounts shall be paid to such Participant's Beneficiary in a lump sum as of the first Valuation Date following the Committee's (or its designee's) receipt of sufficient notice of such Participant's death. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any lump sum distributions of the Deferred Compensation
5.5
Method of Payment
.
 
Account Balance of a Participant that reflects a deemed investment in the Company stock fund shall (unless otherwise determined by the Committee) be distributed in Shares, except that any deemed fractional Shares shall be paid in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the distribution of any portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance attributable to his or her benefits under a Prior Plan, if any, shall be made in the same payment form that was in effect for such benefits under such Prior Plan as of December 31, 2004, and, if no such payment form was in effect under such Prior Plan as of December 31, 2004, distribution of such amount shall be made in a lump sum in accordance with this Section 5.5.
     If the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A with respect to a Participant, the Committee (or its designee) may distribute such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible following discovery of such failure, but only to the extent of the amount required to be included in such Participant's gross income as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations issued thereunder.
5.6
Distribution for Code Section 409A Violation
.
     Upon the termination of this Plan, the Committee (or its designee) may distribute a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible following such termination, provided that one of the following conditions is satisfied:
5.7

Section 503(b)(1)(A), provided that each Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance is included in the applicable Participant's gross income in the latest of:
     (1) The calendar year in which the Plan terminates;
     (2) The calendar year in which such Deferred Compensation Account Balance is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or
     (3) The first calendar year in which such distribution is administratively practicable;
     (b) Such Plan termination occurs, at the Committee's (or its designee's) discretion, within the thirty (30) days preceding or the twelve (12) months following a Change in Control. For purposes of this Section 5.7, the Plan will be treated as terminated only if all substantially similar plans or arrangements sponsored by the
 
Affiliated Group are terminated so that each Participant in the Plan and all participants under substantially similar plans or arrangements are required to receive all amounts of compensation deferred under this Plan and the other terminated plans or arrangements within twelve (12) months of the date of termination of the Plan and other substantially similar plans or arrangements;
     (c) Such Plan termination occurs, at the Affiliated Group discretion, at any time, provided that, with respect to a Participant in the Plan:
     (1) All plans or arrangements sponsored by the Affiliated Group that would be aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 409A and the applicable provisions of the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder if such Participant participated in all of such plans or arrangements (the "Aggregated Participant Plans") are terminated.
     (2) No payments other than payments that would be payable under the terms of that Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans if the Plan termination had not occurred are made within twelve (12) months of the termination of the Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans;
     (3) All payments are made within twenty-four (24) months of the termination of such Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans; and
     (4) The Affiliated Group does not adopt at any time within five (5) years following the date of termination of the Plan a new arrangement that would become a part of that Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans if that Participant participated both in such new arrangement and the Plan.
     All distributions under the Plan shall be based upon a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance as of the end of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date of distribution.
5.8
Valuation of Distributions
.
     To the extent required by law in effect at the time a distribution is made from the Plan, the Company or its agents shall have the right to withhold or deduct from any distributions or payments any taxes required to be withheld by federal, state or local governments.
5.9
Right to Withhold Taxes
.
     Any distribution or payment of any portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be treated as made as of the date designated under the applicable provisions of this Article V only if (a) such distribution or payment does not occur before such date and (b) such distribution or payment actually occurs by the applicable deadline permitted for such distribution or payment under Code Section 409A and the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder.
5.10
Timing of Actual Distributions
.
 
     Except as otherwise provided in this Article V, no distribution of any portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance (and no acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid pursuant to a payment under the Plan) shall be permitted under the Plan.
5.11
Limitations on Distribution
.
 
     Each Participant from time to time may designate any person or persons (who may be named contingently or successively) to receive such benefits as may be payable under the Plan upon or after the death of a Participant, and such designation may be changed from time to time by the Participant by filing a new designation. Each designation shall revoke all prior designations by such Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee (or its designee), and shall be effective only when approved by the Committee (or its designee) during the Participant's lifetime.
6.1
Beneficiary Designation
.
     In the absence of a valid Beneficiary designation, or if, at the time any Plan payment is due to a Beneficiary, there is no living Beneficiary validly named by the Participant, the Committee (or its designee) shall pay any such Plan payment to the Participant's spouse, or, if none, to the Participant's lawful issue, per stirpes or, if none to the Participant's estate. In determining the existence or identity of anyone entitled to receive a Plan payment as aforesaid, or if a dispute arises with respect to any such payment, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, may distribute such payment to the estate of the Participant without liability for any taxes or other consequences that might flow therefrom, or may take such other action as the Committee (or its designee) deems to be appropriate, provided that such action is not inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder.

In the event that the Plan is discontinued with respect to future Deferrals or terminated, each Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be distributed in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, Article V. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, nothing shall restrict the Committee's right to amend the Plan, without the consent of Participants and without additional consideration to affected Participants, to the extent necessary to avoid taxation and/or penalties under Code Section 409A, even if such amendments reduce, restrict or eliminate rights or benefits granted under the Plan.

If the Company or the Committee (or its designee) determines that the continued life or the location of the Participant or Beneficiary cannot be determined, the Company or the Committee (or its designee) shall have the right to direct that the amount payable shall be deemed to be a forfeiture.
10.1
Information to be Furnished by Participants and Beneficiaries and Inability to Locate

A Participant's 2004 bonus deferrals, if any, shall be credited to such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account as soon as administratively feasible on or after the date such deferrals would have otherwise been paid to such Participant if they were not deferred but only if such deferrals are not credited to the Participant's deferred compensation account under the U.S. Bancorp Executive Employees Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferrals of a Participant shall be credited to such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account as soon as administratively feasible on or after the date such Deferrals would have otherwise been paid to such Participant if they were not deferred.

Commencing with the first calendar quarter beginning after a Participant's commencement of participation in the Plan and continuing thereafter for each calendar quarter in which the Participant participates in the Plan, but no later than the last Valuation Date in the applicable calendar quarter, the Participant
Election of Measurement Funds
 
may (but is not required to) elect, by submitting such election on a form designated by the Committee (or its designee) for such purpose to the Committee (or its designee) that is accepted and approved by the Committee (or its designee) or in such other manner required by the Committee (or its designee), to change the Measurement Fund(s) to be used to determine the adjustment amounts to be credited to or debited from such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account. If an election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, it shall apply no later than the Valuation Date immediately following the date of receipt and approval by the Committee (or its designee) and shall continue thereafter for each subsequent calendar quarter in which the Participant participates in the Plan, unless changed in accordance with the previous sentence.
     (b) Any election under Section 4.2(a) above shall result in 100% of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance being allocated among the Measurement Fund(s) elected by the Participant as if the Participant was making an actual investment in the Measurement Fund(s) equal to the portion of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance allocated to such Measurement Fund(s).
Proportionate Allocation
.
     (c) A Participant must elect at least one of the Measurement Funds described in Appendix B for the purpose of determining the manner in which such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance is to be adjusted. The Measurement Funds established by the Committee (or its designee) and described in Appendix B shall include a Company stock fund, which will be invested in Shares, mutual funds selected and approved by the Committee (or its designee) and a money market fund selected and approved by the Committee (or its designee). The Committee (or its designee) shall duly consider, but is not required to approve, the Participant's requested election of the Measurement Fund or Funds or the Participant's requested change in the Measurement Fund or Funds. In all events, the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be determined by reference to such Measurement Fund(s) as the Committee (or its designee) shall have selected from time to time with respect to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance. As necessary, the Committee (or its designee) may, in its sole discretion, discontinue, substitute or add a Measurement Fund(s). Each such action will take effect as of the earliest Valuation Date that follows by at least 30 days the date as of which the Committee (or its designee) gives Participants advance written notice of such change unless the Committee (or its designee) determines circumstances warrant a shorter advance notice.
Measurement Funds
.
     (d) The performance of the elected Measurement Fund(s) (either positive or negative) will be determined by the Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, based on the performance of the Measurement Fund(s) itself (taken into account the reinvestment of dividends, capital gains and interest income distributions therefrom). A Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be debited or credited as of the end of each Valuation Date, based on the performance of the applicable Measurement Fund(s) (at the closing price on such Valuation Date) selected by the Participant, as determined by the Committee (or its designee) in its sole discretion, as though (i) the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance was invested in the Measurement Fund(s) in the manner selected by the Participant and in effect as of the end of each such Valuation Date (at the closing price on
Crediting or Debiting Method
.
 
such Valuation Date); (ii) any Deferrals, 2004 bonus deferrals and any other amounts credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account on that Valuation Date were invested in the Measurement Fund(s) (at the closing price on such Valuation Date) selected by the Participant and in effect as of the end of that Valuation Date; and (iii) any distribution made to a Participant that decreases such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance ceased to be invested in the applicable Measurement Fund(s) (at the closing price on such Valuation Date) as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date as of which such distribution occurred.
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Measurement Funds are to be used for measurement purposes only, and a Participant's election or deemed election of any such Measurement Fund(s), the allocation of his or her Deferred Compensation Account Balance thereto, the calculation of adjustment amounts and the crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance in any such Measurement Fund. If the Company decides to invest funds in any or all of the Measurement Funds, no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments themselves. Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall at all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on such Participant's behalf by the Company. The Participants shall, at all times, remain unsecured creditors of the Company.
No Actual Investments
.
 
     Except as otherwise provided in this Article V, the Deferred Compensation Account Balance of a Participant shall be payable to such Participant (or, in the case of the death of a Participant, his Beneficiary) in the manner determined under Section 5.5.
5.1
In General
.
     At any time before payment in full of amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation Account of a Participant, the Participant may submit a written request to the Committee (or its designee) for the distribution of all or a portion of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance because of a Financial Hardship. Any such request must show sufficient facts as are necessary to establish that a Financial Hardship with respect to such Participant has occurred. If the Committee (or its designee) grants such request, (a) the Committee (or its designee) shall cancel the Participant's deferral election under Section 3.1 for the remaining part of the Plan Year in which a payment under this Section 5.2 was made as a result of such Financial Hardship and (b) the amounts distributed with respect to such Financial Hardship shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such Financial Hardship (which shall include amounts necessary to pay Federal, state and local income taxes and penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution), after taking into account the extent to which such Financial Hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by cessation of such Participant's deferral election under this Section 5.2. Any payment made under this Section 5.2 shall be made in a lump sum as of the date on which such Financial Hardship occurs and shall be subject to the requirements and limitations of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) and the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder.
5.2
Hardship Distributions
.
     If the Committee (or its designee) determines, in its discretion, that a payment under the Plan is to be made to a minor, a person declared incompetent or to a person incapable of handling his or her property, the Committee (or its designee) may direct such payment to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent or incapable person. The Committee (or its designee) may require proof of minority, incompetence, incapacity or guardianship, as it may
5.3
Distributions to Incompetents
.
 
deem appropriate prior to making such payment. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of the Participant and a Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan for such payment amount.
     The Committee (or its designee) is authorized to make any payments required by a domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)) to an individual other than the Participant whose Deferred Compensation Account is the subject of such order at the time and in the manner necessary to fulfill such order.
5.4
Court Ordered Distributions
.
     Each Participant shall elect (a "distribution election") the manner in which his or her Deferred Compensation Account Balance attributable to each Plan Year's Deferrals under this Plan will be distributed to him or her at the time he or she makes a deferral election under Section 3.1. Any such distribution election shall be irrevocable after it is made and approved by the Committee (or its designee) and shall apply only to Deferrals for the Plan Year for which such deferral election was made. A Participant may elect among the following forms of payment: a lump sum or annual installments over a five (5)-year, ten (10)-year, fifteen (15)-year or twenty (20)-year period. Unless otherwise elected by a Participant in the Deferred Compensation Agreement for the applicable Plan Year and approved by the Committee (or its designee) and unless otherwise described below, distributions of such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be made as of his Benefit Commencement Date in a lump sum in cash or in property consisting of the Measurement Fund(s) most recently approved to be used for determining the amounts to be credited or debited from such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account, as elected by the Participant and approved by the Committee (or its designee). If a Participant dies before payment of any amounts payable under the Plan with respect to him or her commences, such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be paid in a lump sum to such Participant's Beneficiary as of the first Valuation Date following the Committee's (or its designee's) receipt of sufficient notice of such Participant's death. If a Participant dies after payment of any portion of amounts payable under the Plan with respect to him or her commences but before all amounts payable under the Plan with respect to him or her have been paid, any such remaining amounts shall be paid to such Participant's Beneficiary in a lump sum as of the first Valuation Date following the Committee's (or its designee's) receipt of sufficient notice of such Participant's death. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any lump sum distributions of the Deferred Compensation
5.5
Method of Payment
.
 
Account Balance of a Participant that reflects a deemed investment in the Company stock fund shall (unless otherwise determined by the Committee) be distributed in Shares, except that any deemed fractional Shares shall be paid in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the distribution of any portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance attributable to his or her benefits under a Prior Plan, if any, shall be made in the same payment form that was in effect for such benefits under such Prior Plan as of December 31, 2004, and, if no such payment form was in effect under such Prior Plan as of December 31, 2004, distribution of such amount shall be made in a lump sum in accordance with this Section 5.5.
     To the extent permitted under Code Section 409A and/or the administrative guidance and regulations issued thereunder, the Committee (or its designee) may distribute the portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance necessary to pay (i) the Federal Insurance Contributions ("FICA") tax imposed under Code Section 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2), where applicable, on amounts deferred under this Plan (the "FICA Amount"), (ii) the income tax at source on wages imposed under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of applicable state, local or foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA Amount and (iii) the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding Code Section 3401 wages and taxes. However, the total payment under this Section 5.6 may not exceed the aggregate of the FICA Amount and the income tax withholding related to such FICA Amount. Any amount distributed under this Section 5.6 shall be used solely to pay the FICA Amount and the income tax withholding related to such FICA Amount.
5.6
Distribution to Pay Taxes
.
     If the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A with respect to a Participant, the Committee (or its designee) may distribute such Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible following discovery of such failure, but only to the extent of the amount required to be included in such Participant's gross income as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations issued thereunder.
5.7
Distribution for Code Section 409A Violation
.
     Upon the termination of this Plan, the Committee (or its designee) may distribute a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account
5.8
Distribution Upon Plan Termination
.
 
Balance as soon as administratively feasible following such termination, provided that one of the following conditions is satisfied:
     (a) Such Plan termination occurs, at the Committee's (or its designee's) discretion, within twelve months of a corporate dissolution of the Employer taxed under Code Section 331 or with the approval of a bankruptcy court under Title 11 U.S.C. Section 503(b)(1)(A), provided that each Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance is included in the applicable Participant's gross income in the latest of:
     (1) The calendar year in which the Plan terminates;
     (2) The calendar year in which such Deferred Compensation Account Balance is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or
     (3) The first calendar year in which such distribution is administratively practicable;
     (b) Such Plan termination occurs, at the Committee's (or its designee's) discretion, within the thirty (30) days preceding or the twelve (12) months following a Change in Control. For purposes of this Section 5.8, the Plan will be treated as terminated only if all substantially similar plans or arrangements sponsored by the Employer are terminated so that each Participant in the Plan and all participants under substantially similar plans or arrangements are required to receive all amounts of compensation deferred under this Plan and the other terminated plans or arrangements within twelve (12) months of the date of termination of the Plan and other substantially similar plans or arrangements;
     (c) Such Plan termination occurs, at the Employer's discretion, at any time, provided that, with respect to a Participant in the Plan:
     (1) All plans or arrangements sponsored by the Employer that would be aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 409A and the applicable provisions of the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder if such Participant participated in all of such plans or arrangements (the "Aggregated Participant Plans") are terminated.
     (2) No payments other than payments that would be payable under the terms of that Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans if the Plan termination had not occurred are made within twelve (12) months of the termination of the Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans;
     (3) All payments are made within twenty-four (24) months of the termination of such Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans; and
     (4) The Employer does not adopt at any time within five (5) years following the date of termination of the Plan a new arrangement that would
 
become a part of that Participant's Aggregated Participant Plans if that Participant participated both in such new arrangement and the Plan.
     All distributions under the Plan shall be based upon a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance as of the end of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date of distribution.
5.9
Valuation of Distributions
.
     To the extent required by law in effect at the time a distribution or payment is made from the Plan, the Company or its agents shall have the right to withhold or deduct from any distributions or payments any taxes required to be withheld by Federal, state or local governments. In addition, the Company may withhold from a Participant's nondeferred compensation, any applicable payroll taxes that may be due at the time any Deferral was made under the Plan.
5.10
Right to Withhold Taxes
.
     Any distribution or payment of any portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be treated as made as of the date designated under the applicable provisions of this Article V only if (a) such distribution or payment does not occur before such date and (b) such distribution or payment actually occurs by the applicable deadline permitted for such distribution or payment under Code Section 409A and the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder.
5.11
Timing of Actual Distributions
.
     Except as otherwise provided in this Article V, no distribution of any portion of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance (and no acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid pursuant to a payment under the Plan) shall be permitted under the Plan.
5.12
Limitations on Distribution
.
 
     Each Participant from time to time may designate any person or persons (who may be named contingently or successively) to receive such benefits as may be payable under the Plan upon or after the death of a Participant, and such designation may be changed from time to time by the Participant by filing a new designation. Each designation shall revoke all prior designations by such Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee (or its designee), and shall be effective only when approved by the Committee (or its designee) during the Participant's lifetime.
6.1
Beneficiary Designation
.
     In the absence of a valid Beneficiary designation, or if, at the time any Plan payment is due to a Beneficiary, there is no living Beneficiary validly named by the Participant, the Committee (or its designee) shall pay any such Plan payment to the Participant's spouse, or, if none, to the Participant's lawful issue, per stirpes or, if none to the Participant's estate. In determining the existence or identity of anyone entitled to receive a Plan payment as aforesaid, or if a dispute arises with respect to any such payment, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, may distribute such payment to the estate of the Participant without liability for any taxes or other consequences that might flow therefrom, or may take such other action as the Committee (or its designee) deems to be appropriate, provided that such action is not inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder.
6.2
No Beneficiary Designation
.
 
     The Plan shall be unfunded and no trust or special deposit shall be created, or deemed to be created, by the Plan or the Company. The crediting of amounts to the Deferred Compensation Account of a Participant shall be made through recordkeeping entries. No actual funds or Shares shall be segregated, reserved, or otherwise set aside; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the Company from establishing one or more grantor trusts from which distributions due under the Plan may be paid. All distributions shall be paid by the Company from its general assets and/or from one or more grantor trusts established by the Company and a Participant or a Beneficiary shall have the rights of a general, unsecured creditor against the Company for any distributions due hereunder. The benefits provided to Participants under the Plan constitute a mere promise by the Company to make such payments in the future.
7.1
Plan Unfunded
.
     Each Participant has an interest only in the cash value of his or her Deferred Compensation Account. No Participant shall have any right or interest in any specific fund, stock or securities.
7.2.
Interests of Participants Under the Plan
.
 
     The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, which may delegate all or a portion of its duties to one or more employees of the Company. The Committee has, to the extent appropriate and in addition to the powers described elsewhere in the Plan, full discretionary authority to construe and interpret the terms and provision of the Plan; to make factual determinations concerning a Participant's eligibility for benefits under the Plan and other administrative matters relating to a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account; to adopt, alter and repeal administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan; to perform all acts, including the delegation of its administrative responsibilities to advisors or other persons who may or may not be employees of the Company; and to rely upon the information or opinions of legal counsel or experts selected to render advice with respect to the Plan, as it shall deem advisable, with respect to the administration of the Plan. Any action to be taken by the Committee shall be taken by a majority of its members, either at a meeting or by written instrument approved by such majority in the absence of a meeting. A written resolution or memorandum signed by one Committee member and the secretary of the Committee shall be sufficient evidence to any person of any action taken under the Plan.
8.1
Administration
.
     The Committee (or its designee) may take any action, correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, or in any election hereunder, in the manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary to carry the Plan into effect or to carry out the Board's purposes in adopting the Plan. Any decision, interpretation or other action made or taken by the Committee (or its designee) arising out of or in connection with the Plan, shall be within the absolute discretion of the Committee (or its designee), and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company as well as all Participants, Beneficiaries and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. The determinations by the Committee (or its designee) with respect to the Plan need not be uniform, and may be made selectively among Employees, whether or not they are similarly situated.
8.2
Interpretation
.
     The Committee (or its designee) shall keep a record of proceedings and actions and shall maintain or cause to be maintained all such books of account, records, and other data as shall be necessary for the proper administration of the Plan. Such

     The Company shall bear all expenses incurred by it and by the Committee in administering the Plan.
8.4

8.5
Indemnification for Liability
.
     A Participant or Beneficiary who believes he or she is entitled to a benefit under the Plan shall file a written claim with the Committee. If such claim is denied in whole or in part, the Committee (or its designee) shall notify (in writing or electronically) such Participant or Beneficiary (hereinafter referred to as the "Claimant") or an authorized representative of the Claimant, as applicable, of any adverse benefit determination (within the meaning of DOL Reg. Section 2560.503-1(m)(4)) concerning such claim within ninety (90) days of receipt of the claim. If the Committee (or its designee) determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Committee (or its designee) shall notify the Claimant in writing of the extension before the end of the initial ninety (90)-day period and the written notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Committee (or its designee) expects to make a decision. The extension of time shall not exceed ninety (90) days from the end of the initial ninety (90)-day period.
8.6
Claims Procedure
.
     Any adverse benefit determination notice shall describe the specific reason or reasons for the denial, refer to the specific Plan provisions on which the termination was based, describe any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim and explain why that material or information is necessary, and describe the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to those procedures, including a statement of the Claimant's right to bring a civil action under ERISA Section 502(a) following a denial upon review. If the notification is made electronically, it must comply with DOL. Reg. Section 2520.104b-(1)(c)(1)(i), (iii) and (iv).
 
     Upon receipt of an adverse benefit determination, a Claimant may, within sixty (60) days after receiving notification of that determination, submit a written request asking the Committee to review the Claimant's claim. Each Claimant, when making his or her request for review of his or her adverse benefit determination, shall have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records and any other information relating to the claim for benefits. Each Claimant shall also be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to such Claimant's claim for benefits. The review shall take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim, regardless of whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. If a Claimant does not submit his or her request for review in writing within the sixty (60)-day period described above, his claim shall be deemed to have been conclusively determined for all purposes of the Plan and the adverse benefit determination will be deemed to be correct.
     If the Claimant submits in writing a request for review of the adverse benefit determination within the sixty (60)-day period described above, the Committee (or its designee) shall notify (in writing or electronically) him or her of its determination on review within a reasonable period of time but not later than sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of his request for review, unless the Committee (or its designee) determines that special circumstances require an extension of time. If the Committee (or its designee) determines that an extension of time for processing a Claimant's request for review is required, the Committee (or its designee) shall notify him or her in writing before the end of the initial sixty (60)-day period and inform him or her of the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Committee (or its designee) expects to render its determination on review. The extension of time will not exceed sixty (60) days from the end of the initial sixty (60)-day period.
     If the Committee (or its designee) confirms the adverse benefit determination upon review, the notification will describe the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination, refer to the specific Plan provisions on which the benefit determination is based, include a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the Claimant's claim, and include a statement describing the Claimant's right to bring an action under ERISA
 
Section 502(a). In all events, the claims procedure described above shall be administered in a manner not inconsistent with ERISA Section 503 and DOL Reg. Section 2560.503-1.
 
     Subject to Section 9.2 hereof, the Committee may at any time amend or terminate any or all of the provisions of the Plan in any manner; provided, however, that in no event shall any such amendment or termination adversely affect the right of any Participant or Beneficiary to a payment under the Plan on the basis of amounts allocated to the Deferred Compensation Account of a Participant as of the date of such amendment or termination. In the event that the Plan is discontinued with respect to future Deferrals or terminated, each Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be distributed in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, Article V. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, nothing shall restrict the Committee's right to amend the Plan, without the consent of Participants and without additional consideration to affected Participants, to the extent necessary to avoid taxation and/or penalties under Code Section 409A, even if such amendments reduce, restrict or eliminate rights or benefits granted under the Plan.
9.1
In General
.
     Notwithstanding Section 9.1, the Committee may not amend or terminate the Plan without the prior written consent of all Participants for a period of two calendar years following a Change in Control, provided that each Participant's Deferred Compensation Account Balance shall be distributed in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, Article V.
9.2
Termination After Change in Control
.
 
     Any communication, statement or notice addressed to a Participant or to a Beneficiary at his or her last address as shown on the records of the Company shall be binding on the Participant or Beneficiary for all purposes of the Plan. Neither the Company nor the Committee shall be obliged to search for any Participant or Beneficiary beyond the sending of a certified or registered mail letter to such last known address. If the Company or the Committee (or its designee) notifies any Participant or Beneficiary that he or she is entitled to an amount under the Plan and the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim such amount or make his continued life and location known to the Company or the Committee (or its designee) within three years thereafter, then, except as otherwise required by law, if the location of one or more of the next of kin of the Participant is known to the Company or the Committee (or its designee), the Company or the Committee (or its designee) may direct distribution of such amount to any one or more or all of such next of kin, and in such proportions as the Company or the Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, determines. If the Company or Committee (or its designee) determines that the continued life or the location of the Participant or Beneficiary cannot be determined, the Company or the Committee (or its designee) shall have the right to direct that the amount payable shall be deemed to be a forfeiture.
10.1
Information to be Furnished by Participants and Beneficiaries and Inability to Locate
.
     The maintenance of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the Company and any Employee, or to be a consideration for, or an inducement or condition of, the employment of any Employee. Nothing herein contained, or any action taken hereunder, shall be deemed to give an Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or to interfere with the right of the Company to discipline or discharge an Employee at any time, nor shall it be deemed to give to the Company the right to require the Employee to remain in its employ, nor shall it interfere with any rights of the Employee to terminate his or her employment at any time.
10.2
Right of the Company to Take Employment Actions
.

payments under the Plan shall not be subject to alienation, attachment, execution, levy, pledge or garnishment by or on behalf of creditors (including heirs, beneficiaries, or dependents) of the Participant or a Beneficiary.
     All legal questions pertaining to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota, without reference to conflict of laws provisions, to the extent such laws are not superseded by ERISA or any other federal law.
10.4
Construction
.
     The headings of the Articles and Sections of the Plan are for reference only. In the event of a conflict between a heading and the contents of an Article or Section, the contents of the Article or Section shall control.
10.5
Headings
.
     The Company shall be the agent for service of legal process with respect to any matter concerning the Plan, unless and until the Company designates some other person as such agent.
10.6
Agent for Legal Process
.
     Although the Committee (or its designee) shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation and penalties under Code Section 409A, the tax treatment of Deferrals is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company, the Board, nor the Committee (or its designee) shall be held liable for any taxes, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant, Employee, Beneficiary or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan.
