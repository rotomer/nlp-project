ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On January 17, 2006, U.S. Bancorp ("the Company") issued a press release discussing results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005, and filed that press release with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a Current Report on Form 8-K. Revised information relating to nonperforming assets is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
     During a review of its year-end financial statements, the Company determined that the disclosure relating to nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2005, contained in the January 17, 2006 press release had failed to reflect amounts attributable to a particular credit card collection management program. This collection program was implemented by the Company in June 2005 in response to new minimum balance payment requirements guidelines issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. Including this program in nonperforming loans increases the percentage of nonperforming assets to total loans plus other real estate owned to .47 percent from .43 percent at December 31, 2005. There is no impact to reported earnings of the Company since credit performance with respect to the program, including anticipated charge-offs, had been considered in management's determination of the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2005. The Company does not anticipate any significant future increases in nonperforming assets as a result of this or similar consumer credit card collection programs. In addition, the Company reconfirms its view, expressed in the January 17 press release, that total net charge-offs in early 2006 will approximate levels reported in the third quarter of 2005.
