with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein, and in the course of preparation of those documents such counsel has participated in conferences with representatives of the Guarantor and with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP and (y) based upon such counsel's examination of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein, such counsel's investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein and such counsel's participation in the conferences referred to above, such counsel has no reason to believe that: (A) the Registration Statement including the Rule 430B Information (other than the financial statements, supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, and any Form T-1, as to which no statement need be rendered), as of its effective date and each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f) under the Securities Act, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (B) that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than the financial statements, supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which no statement need be rendered) as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In addition, nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead such counsel to believe that the documents included in the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements, supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which no statement need be rendered), as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. With respect to statements contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time, any statement contained in any of the constituent documents shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that any information contained in subsequent constituent documents modifies or replaces such statement.
          Such counsel may rely (i) as to those matters that relate to the Indenture Trustee, the Guarantee Trust, the Property Trustee or the Collateral Agent, upon the certificate or certificates of such entity, and (ii) as to certain matters governed by
 
Delaware law, upon the opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., delivered pursuant to Section 6(f).
     (e) The Guarantor shall have furnished to the Underwriters an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Lee R. Mitau, General Counsel of the Guarantor, to the effect that:
     (i) The Guarantor is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each U.S. jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of substantial properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure so to qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
     (ii) U.S. Bank National Association is lawfully able to transact business in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases substantial properties or conducts business, except for the jurisdictions in which the failure to be lawfully able to conduct business would not have a Material Adverse Effect on U.S. Bank National Association and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

     (iv) To the best of the knowledge of such counsel, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened against the Trust or to which the Trust or any of its property is subject, that are required to be described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus that are not described as required and there are no agreements, contracts, indentures, leases or other instruments of the Trust that are required to be described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus that are not described as required; and
     (v) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Trust Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement, the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Collateral Agreement, the issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Guarantee, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein, and the performance of the obligations thereunder will not conflict with or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Guarantor or any subsidiary pursuant to any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound or to which any of the property
 
or assets of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is subject and that is material to the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
     Such counsel may rely (i) as to those matters which relate to the Indenture Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee, the Property Trustee or the Collateral Agent, upon the certificate or certificates of such entity, (ii) as to matters governed by New York law, upon the opinion of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, L.L.P., delivered pursuant to Section 6(d) and (iii) as to certain matters governed by Delaware law, upon the opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., delivered pursuant to Section 6(f).

     (iv) Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, (A) the Trust has the trust power and authority to (x) execute and deliver this Agreement and the Other Trust Transaction Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Other Trust Transaction Agreements, and (y) issue and perform its obligations under the ITS and the Trust Common Securities; and (B) the Guarantor is authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement on behalf of the Trust;

     (vi) Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the form of certificates attached to the Trust Agreement to represent the Normal ITS, Stripped ITS and Capital ITS are appropriate forms of certificates to evidence ownership of the Normal ITS, the Stripped ITS and the Capital ITS, respectively. The Normal ITS have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and, when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters, in accordance with this Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable beneficial interests in the Trust. The holders of the Normal ITS, the Stripped ITS and the Capital ITS are entitled to the benefits provided by the Trust Agreement (subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement); the Capital ITS and the Stripped ITS, when issued upon an Exchange in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, will have been duly and validly issued and, will be fully paid and non-assessable beneficial interests in the Trust; and the holders of ITS, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, that such counsel may note that the holders of ITS and of the Trust Common Securities may be obligated, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, to (a) provide indemnity and/or security in connection with and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from transfers or exchanges of ITS certificates and the issuance of replacement of ITS certificates, and (b) provide security and indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Property Trustee (as defined in the Trust Agreement) to exercise its rights and remedies under the Trust Agreement;
provided
     (vii) The Trust Common Securities have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and when issued and delivered by the Trust to the Guarantor against payment therefor described in the Trust Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid (subject to the qualifications described in the proviso to clause (vi) next above) beneficial interests in the Trust. The Guarantor, as holder of the Trust Common Securities, will be entitled to the benefits of the Trust Agreement;
     (viii) Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the issuance of the ITS and the Trust Common Securities is not subject to preemptive rights;

     (x) No authorization, approval, consent or order of any Delaware court or Delaware governmental authority or Delaware agency is required to be obtained by the Trust solely in connection with the issuance and sale of the ITS and the Trust Common Securities or the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of this Agreement or the Other Trust Transaction Agreements. In rendering the opinion expressed in this paragraph (x), such counsel need express no opinion concerning the securities laws of the State of Delaware;
     (xi) The issuance by the Guarantor of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Guarantor's certificate of incorporation, as amended, has been duly authorized and, when certificates evidencing the shares of Preferred Stock have been executed by the Guarantor and authenticated by the Guarantor's transfer agent in the manner provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and delivered on the Stock Purchase Date, such shares will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; and
     (xii) Assuming that the Trust derives no income from or connected with services provided within the State of Delaware and has no assets, activities (other than maintaining the Delaware Trustee and the filing of documents with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware) or employees in the State of Delaware and assuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust or as an association not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the holders of ITS (other than those holders who reside or are domiciled in the State of Delaware) will have no liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware solely as a result of their participation in the Trust, and the Trust will not be liable for any income tax imposed by the State of Delaware.
     (g) The Underwriters shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as the Underwriters may reasonably require.

     (i) Subsequent to the Applicable Time, there shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the financial position, long-term debt, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries which the Underwriters conclude, after consultation with the Guarantor, in the judgment of the Underwriters is so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Normal ITS as contemplated by the Prospectus.

Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Guarantor and the Trust in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
 
     7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Guarantor and the Trust agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter (each an "") within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act as follows:
Indemnified Person
     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information (or any amendment to the Registration Statement), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement);
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Underwriter as aforesaid) if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Guarantor or the Trust (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Indemnified Person), as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
 
statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Underwriter as aforesaid), to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above.
     (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Guarantor and the Trust, each of their respective directors or trustees, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in paragraph (a) of this Section 7, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement).
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances; , , that when more than one of the Underwriters is an indemnified party each such Underwriter shall be entitled to separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in each such jurisdiction to the extent such Underwriter may have interests conflicting with those of the other Underwriter or Underwriters because of the participation of one Underwriter in a transaction hereunder in which the other Underwriter or Underwriters did not participate. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
provided
however
 
     (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Section 7 is for any reason held to be unavailable to the Underwriters in accordance with its terms, the Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to Normal ITS sold to the Underwriters in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in such proportion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by the Underwriters to the date of such liability bears to the total sales price (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust from the sale of the Normal ITS made to the Underwriters to the date of such liability, and the Guarantor and the Trust are responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the Underwriters failed to give the notice required under (c), then the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor and the Trust or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were determined pro rata (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Normal ITS referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph that were offered and sold to the public through the Underwriters exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled under this paragraph to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section
 
15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Guarantor, each trustee of the Trust, each officer of the Guarantor and the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Guarantor and the Trust.
          8. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters by notice given to the Guarantor and the Trust prior to delivery of and payment for the Normal ITS, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally or in the Guarantor's securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis or a change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States or elsewhere is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Normal ITS as contemplated by the Prospectus.
Termination
          9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Normal ITS which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Normal ITS on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Normal ITS, then the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Normal ITS on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Guarantor that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Normal ITS, or the Guarantor notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Normal ITS, you or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Normal ITS.
Underwriter Default
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Normal ITS of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Normal ITS which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Normal ITS, then the Guarantor shall have the right to require each
 
non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Normal ITS which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Normal ITS which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Normal ITS of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Normal ITS of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Normal ITS which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Normal ITS, or if the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Normal ITS of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          10. . If for any reason the Normal ITS are not delivered by or on behalf of the Guarantor as provided herein other than because of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Normal ITS but the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Section 7.
Expenses on Termination
          11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Guarantor or its officers, of the Trust and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Guarantor or the Trust or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7(b) hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Normal ITS. The provisions of Sections 5(A)(g) and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
          12. . The Trust and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Normal ITS pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Normal ITS and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Trust or the Guarantor, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory
Arm's Length Terms
 
or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Trust or the Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Trust or the Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Trust or the Guarantor except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Trust and the Guarantor, and (v) the Trust and the Guarantor have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate. The Trust and the Guarantor agree that they will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Trust or the Guarantor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto, or the financial, tax or other related consequences of the transaction for the Trust or the Guarantor.
          13. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, executors, and administrators, and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
