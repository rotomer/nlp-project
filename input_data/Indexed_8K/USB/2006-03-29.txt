Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Compensation Committee of U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") has approved the U.S. Bancorp 2006 Executive Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which will not become effective unless and until the Companys stockholders approve the Plan at the Companys 2006 annual shareholders meeting, as described in the Companys proxy statement filed with the Commission on March 8, 2006. As described in Proposal 3 of the proxy statement and in the Plan, the Plan permits the payment of annual bonuses to eligible participants based on the Companys Net Income (as defined in the Plan). If the Companys Net Income is not a positive number, no bonus will be payable under the Plan. If the Companys Net Income is a positive number, the potential bonus award to a participant will equal up to 0.2% of Net Income, which amount is subject to decrease by the Compensation Committee based on its consideration of a variety of factors, including financial and non-financial criteria and corporate and individual performance. Within the framework of the Plan, for purposes of the 2006 annual bonus performance period, the Compensation Committee has established (and currently intends to establish in future years) criteria, in addition to the basic Net Income requirement, that it will consider when determining whether, and to what extent, to reduce the actual bonus award below 0.2% of Net Income. These criteria include the Companys achievement of pre-established goals relating to a minimum level of earnings per share and return on equity, the Companys performance relative to its peer group and the participants individual performance. As described in Proposal 3 of the proxy statement, the Plan is designed to satisfy the qualified performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which exception also requires stockholder approval of the Plan.
