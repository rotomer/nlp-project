ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
(c) Exhibits.
     99.1 Press Release issued by U.S. Bancorp on July 18, 2006, deemed "furnished" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
     DATE: July 18, 2006

 
Exhibit 99.1
     U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $1,201 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with $1,121 million for the second quarter of 2005. Net income of $.66 per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2006 was higher than the same period of 2005 by 10.0 percent, or $.06 per diluted common share. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 2.27 percent and 24.3 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2006, compared with returns of 2.23 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2005.
MINNEAPOLIS, July 18, 2006 
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jerry A. Grundhofer said, "Historically, the second quarter of the year is one of the Company's strongest, and this year was no exception. Our earnings per diluted common share grew by ten percent over the same quarter of 2005 and 4.8 percent over the first quarter of 2006. We achieved industry-leading performance metrics of return on assets of 2.27 percent and return on average common equity of 24.3 percent. We recorded
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2006 Results July 18, 2006 Page 2
exceptional growth in fee revenue, and that growth, coupled with controlled expenses, led to a tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter of 41.8 percent. Growing revenue faster than expense has always been a goal of this Company, and we did just that this quarter. As a result, we created positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.
     "The growth in noninterest income was 13.9 percent year-over-year. Our payments and fiduciary businesses were the primary contributors to the increase in fee income, both of which recorded solid organic growth, as well as incremental revenue from recent acquisitions. In addition, consumer banking posted strong increases in deposit service charges year-over-year.
     "Once again, credit quality was outstanding. These results are the direct benefit of our efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the Company. Going forward, we will continue to focus on acquiring high quality credits and maintaining our current risk profile. The offset may be slightly lower spread income and loan growth, but the reward should be lower overall credit costs during the next credit cycle.
     "Total average loans increased year-over-year by 7.3 percent, while total average earning assets rose by 4.6 percent. Despite the increase in average earning assets, net interest income for the quarter was lower than the same period of last year, as our net interest margin declined to 3.68 percent. Competitive pricing and growth in lower-spread assets, given the current interest rate environment, had a significant impact on the margin. Our challenge going forward will be to grow credit products at reasonable spreads that compensate for the risk involved. We can compete effectively in this environment given our powerful fee-based product set and our status as a low-cost producer.
     "We announced two acquisitions in June. First, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase Vail Banks, Inc., the parent company of WestStar Bank. This acquisition will add 24 new branch locations to our franchise in western Colorado. Second, we announced the purchase of Schneider Payment Services, a division of Schneider National, Inc. These two small acquisitions fit very well into our expansion strategy. The Colorado branches will enhance our distribution in attractive, growing markets, while Schneider Payment Services will expand our current fee-based freight payment offerings and business opportunities.
     "I am very pleased overall with our second quarter results. These results demonstrate that our Company can produce high-quality earnings for our shareholders by leveraging its balanced

business mix, advantaged scale, reduced risk profile, low-cost leadership and dedication to customer service."
     The Company's results for the second quarter of 2006 improved over the same period of 2005, as net income increased by $80 million (7.1 percent), primarily due to strong growth in a majority of fee-based products. Included in the second quarter of 2006 results was a $35 million gain related to the Company's proportionate share of the initial public offering of MasterCard, Incorporated ("MasterCard IPO").
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the second quarter of 2006 was $3,452 million, $150 million (4.5 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting a 13.9 percent increase in noninterest income partially offset by a 3.6 percent decline in net interest income. Noninterest income growth was driven by organic business growth and recent expansion in trust and payment processing businesses, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue due to the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets" ("SFAS 156") in the first quarter of 2006. Mortgage banking revenue in the second quarter of 2006 was impacted primarily by the effect of principal repayments on the valuation of servicing rights that was previously recognized as part of intangible expense. Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2006 was $1,530 million, $65 million (4.1 percent) lower than the second quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting lower intangible expense due to the adoption of SFAS 156 and lower debt prepayment expense. This was partially offset by incremental operating and business integration costs principally associated with recent acquisitions, increased pension costs and higher expenses related to investments in tax-advantaged projects from a year ago.
     Provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2006 was $125 million, a decrease of $19 million from the second quarter of 2005. The decrease in the provision for credit losses year-over-year primarily reflected strong credit quality and the near-term favorable impact of changes in bankruptcy law in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2006 were $125 million, compared with the first quarter of 2006 net charge-offs of $115 million and the second quarter of 2005 net charge-offs of $144 million. Total nonperforming assets were $550 million at June 30, 2006, compared with $619 million at March 31, 2006, and $610 million at June 30, 2005. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 500 percent at June 30, 2006, compared with 432 percent at March 31, 2006, and 441 percent at June 30, 2005.

Net Interest Income
     Second quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,697 million, compared with $1,761 million recorded in the second quarter of 2005. Average earning assets for the period increased over the second quarter of 2005 by $8.2 billion (4.6 percent), primarily driven by a $3.7 billion (21.3 percent) increase in residential mortgages, a $2.6 billion (6.0 percent) increase in total commercial loans, a $2.2 billion (4.9 percent) increase in total retail loans and a $1.2 billion (4.4 percent) increase in total commercial real estate loans. This was partially offset by a $2.3 billion (5.3 percent) decrease in investment securities. The positive impact to net interest income from the growth in earning assets was more than offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin in the second quarter of 2006 was 3.68 percent, compared with 3.99 percent in the second quarter of 2005. The decline in the net interest margin reflected the competitive lending environment during 2005, asset/liability management decisions and the impact of changes in the yield curve from a year ago. Since the second quarter of 2005, credit spreads have tightened by approximately 23 basis points across most lending products due to competitive pricing and a change in mix due to growth in lower-spread, fixed-rate credit products. The net interest margin also declined due to funding incremental asset growth with higher cost wholesale funding, share repurchases and asset/liability decisions designed to minimize the Company's rate sensitivity position. An increase in the margin benefit of net free funds and loan fees partially offset these factors.

     Net interest income in the second quarter of 2006 was lower than the first quarter of 2006 by $28 million (1.6 percent). The net interest margin of 3.68 percent in the second quarter of 2006 was 12 basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.80 percent in the first quarter of 2006. The decline in the net interest margin from the first quarter of 2006 was due to continued tightening of the credit spreads, incrementally funding a higher percentage of earning assets with wholesale funding and the ongoing impact of the flat yield curve. During the second quarter of 2006, credit spreads narrowed 7 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2006.

     Average loans for the second quarter of 2006 were $9.6 billion (7.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2005, driven by growth in average residential mortgages of $3.7 billion (21.3 percent), total commercial loans of $2.6 billion (6.0 percent), total retail loans of $2.2 billion (4.9 percent) and total commercial real estate loans of $1.2 billion (4.4 percent). Average loans for the second quarter of 2006 were higher than the first quarter of 2006 by $1.5 billion (1.1 percent), reflecting growth in the majority of loan categories. Residential mortgages remained relatively flat in the second quarter of 2006 compared with the first quarter of 2006. During the first quarter of 2006, the Company began selling an increased proportion of its residential mortgage loan production and anticipates that balances will remain essentially flat or decline somewhat during the next several quarters.
     Average investment securities in the second quarter of 2006 were $2.3 billion (5.3 percent) lower than in the second quarter of 2005. The change in the balance of the investment securities portfolio from a year ago principally reflected asset/liability management decisions to reduce the focus on residential mortgage assets given the changing rate environment and mix of loan growth. Additionally, the Company reclassified approximately $460 million of principal-only securities to its trading account effective as of January 1, 2006, in connection with the adoption of SFAS 156.

During the second quarter of 2006, the Company maintained a mix of approximately 40 percent variable-rate securities.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2006 remained relatively flat, decreasing only $199 million (.7 percent) compared with the second quarter of 2005 despite a reduction of excess liquidity in the markets.
     Average total savings deposits declined year-over-year by $2.4 billion (4.2 percent) due to reductions in average money market savings and savings accounts. Average money market savings balances declined by $2.6 billion (8.7 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to a decline in balances within the branches. This was partially offset by increases in broker dealer and corporate trust balances. The overall decrease in average money market savings balances year-over-year was primarily the result of the Company's deposit pricing decisions for money market products in relation to other fixed-rate deposit products offered. A portion of branch based money market savings accounts have migrated to fixed-rate time certificates, while larger customer money market savings accounts have migrated to time deposits greater than $100,000 as rates increased on the time deposit products.
     Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were higher in the second quarter of 2006 than the second quarter of 2005 by $537 million (4.1 percent). The Company experienced year-over-year growth in average time deposits greater than $100,000 of $2.1 billion (10.3 percent). This growth was broad-based across most areas of the bank including; corporate, commercial,

branch banking, private client and corporate trust, as customers migrated balances to higher rate deposits.
     Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2006 increased modestly compared with the first quarter of 2006 principally representing seasonal deposit balances. Total savings deposits declined slightly, $174 million (.3 percent) from the first quarter of 2006 while fixed-rate time certificates and time deposits greater than $100,000 increased by $1.1 billion reflecting the impact of product pricing decisions by the Company.
Noninterest Income
     Second quarter noninterest income was $1,755 million, an increase of $214 million (13.9 percent) from the same quarter of 2005 and $141 million (8.7 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2006. The increase in noninterest income over the second quarter of 2005 was driven by favorable variances in the majority of fee income categories and the impact of the MasterCard IPO gain included in other incomeThis strong growth in revenue was partially offset by the accounting impact of SFAS 156 on mortgage banking revenue.
.
     Credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue were both higher in the second quarter of 2006 than the second quarter of 2005 by $25 million and $19 million, or 14.1
(More)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2006 Results July 18, 2006 Page 9
percent and 15.8 percent, respectively. The strong growth in credit and debit card revenue was primarily driven by higher customer transaction volumes. The corporate payment products revenue growth reflected organic growth in sales volumes and card usage. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in the second quarter of 2006 than the same quarter a year ago by $55 million (27.8 percent), reflecting an increase in sales volume driven by acquisitions, higher same store sales and equipment fees. Trust and investment management fees increased by $61 million (24.1 percent) year-over-year, due to improved equity market conditions, incremental account growth and customer balances and the acquisition of the corporate and institutional trust business of Wachovia Corporation. Deposit service charges grew year-over-year by $30 million (12.8 percent) due to increased transaction-related fees. Other income was higher by $44 million (32.6 percent) as compared to the second quarter of 2005, primarily due to the gain on the MasterCard IPO. These favorable changes in fee-based revenue were partially offset by the decline in mortgage banking revenue, principally driven by the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for mortgage servicing rights ($33 million).
     Noninterest income was higher in the second quarter of 2006 than the first quarter of 2006 by $141 million (8.7 percent). This reflected a $20 million (11.0 percent) increase in credit and debit card revenue and a $12 million (9.4 percent) increase in corporate payment products revenue due primarily to organic growth and seasonally higher transaction volume. Merchant processing services revenue increased by $40 million (18.8 percent), due primarily to higher same store sales volumes, pricing enhancements and recent business acquisitions. Trust and investment management fees and treasury management fees increased over the first quarter of 2006 by $17 million (5.7 percent) and $9 million (8.4 percent), respectively, due to seasonal tax-related processing volumes. Mortgage banking revenue was $51 million higher in the second quarter of 2006 due primarily to losses on principal-only securities and a hedging/mortgage servicing rights valuation mismatch due to the adoption of SFAS 156 in the first quarter of 2006. Other revenue decreased primarily due to a $44 million gain on certain interest rate swaps and a favorable settlement within the merchant processing business recorded in the first quarter of 2006, as well as lower gains on student loan sales and equity investment income in the second quarter of 2006 as compared with the first quarter of 2006, partially offset by the MasterCard IPO gain recorded in the current quarter.

Noninterest Expense
     Second quarter noninterest expense totaled $1,530 million, a decrease of $65 million (4.1 percent) from the same quarter of 2005 and a $30 million (2.0 percent) increase from the first quarter of 2006. The decrease from a year ago primarily reflected the impact of adopting SFAS 156 on other intangible expense and lower debt prepayment expense. Compensation expense was higher year-over-year by $15 million (2.5 percent) primarily due to the corporate and institutional trust and payments processing acquisitions and other growth initiatives. Benefits expense increased from the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to higher pension costs. Technology and communications expense rose by $14 million (12.4 percent) due to increased software expense and higher outside data processing expense principally associated with expanding a prepaid gift card program and the corporate and institutional trust acquisition. Other expense increased in the second quarter of 2006 from the same quarter of 2005 by $28 million (14.1 percent) primarily due to increased investments in tax-advantaged projects relative to a year ago and business integration costs. Offsetting these expense increases was a year-over-year decline in other intangible expense of $92 million (50.8 percent), reflecting the elimination of mortgage servicing rights amortization and impairment due to the adoption of SFAS 156, and lower debt prepayment expense of $43 million.

U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2006 Results July 18, 2006 Page 11
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2006 was higher than the first quarter of 2006 by $30 million (2.0 percent). The increase in noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006 was primarily due to operating costs from acquired businesses, an $18 million (45.0 percent) increase in marketing and business development due to the timing of marketing initiatives in consumer banking and payment systems, and debt prepayment expenses of $11 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in compensation expense due to the incremental stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2006 related to adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R") and lower benefits expense related to seasonal changes in payroll taxes and other benefits.
Provision for Income Taxes
     The provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.8 percent compared with an effective tax rate of 28.0 percent in the second quarter of 2005 and an effective tax rate of 32.7 percent in first quarter of 2006. The increase in the effective rate from the same quarter of the prior year was due to a $94 million reduction in income tax expense in the second quarter of 2005 related to the resolution of federal tax examinations covering substantially all of the Company's legal entities for years 2000 through 2002.

Credit Quality
     The allowance for credit losses was $2,251 million at June 30, 2006, and at March 31, 2006, compared with $2,269 million at June 30, 2005. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 1.59 percent at June 30, 2006, compared with 1.62 percent at March 31, 2006, and 1.70 percent at June 30, 2005. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 500 percent at June 30, 2006, compared with 432 percent at March 31, 2006, and 441 percent at June 30, 2005. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2006 were $125 million, compared with the first quarter of 2006 net charge-offs of $115 million and the second quarter of 2005 net charge-offs of $144 million. The year-over-year decrease in total net charge-offs was
(More)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2006 Results July 18, 2006 Page 13
principally due to the impact of changes in bankruptcy legislation that went into effect during the fourth quarter of 2005.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were $20 million for the second quarter of 2006, or .11 percent of average loans outstanding, compared with $14 million, or .08 percent of average loans outstanding, in the first quarter of 2006 and $13 million, or .07 percent of average loans outstanding, in the second quarter of 2005. The increase in net charge-offs reflected a lower level of recoveries as compared with prior quarters.
     Retail loan net charge-offs were $94 million in the second quarter and first quarter of 2006 compared with $123 million in the second quarter of 2005. Retail loan net charge-offs remained flat as compared to the first quarter of 2006 and declined from the second quarter of 2005, reflecting the impact of the bankruptcy legislation change that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. Retail loan net charge-offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were .82 percent in the second quarter of 2006, compared with .83 percent and 1.12 percent in the first quarter of 2006 and second quarter of 2005, respectively. The Company anticipates that bankruptcy charge-offs will return to more normalized levels in future quarters.

     Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2006, totaled $550 million, compared with $619 million at March 31, 2006, and $610 million at June 30, 2005. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was .39 percent at June 30, 2006, compared with .45 percent at March 31, 2006, and .46 percent at June 30, 2005. Restructured loans that continue to accrue interest have increased from the second quarter of 2005, reflecting the impact of implementing higher minimum balance payment requirements for credit card customers in response to industry guidance issued by the banking regulatory agencies.

     Total shareholders' equity was $20.4 billion at June 30, 2006, compared with $19.9 billion at June 30, 2005. The increase was the result of corporate earnings and the issuance of $1.0 billion of non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock on March 27, 2006, offset by share buybacks and dividends. On June 20, 2006, the Company's board of directors declared the first quarterly dividend on the preferred stock. The $432.44 per share (equivalent to $.43244 per depository share) was declared for shareholders of record on June 30, 2006, payable July 17, 2006.
     The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.9 percent at June 30, 2006, and at March 31, 2006, and 8.1 percent at June 30, 2005. The total risk-based capital ratio was 13.1 percent at June 30, 2006, and at March 31, 2006, and 12.5 percent at June 30, 2005. The leverage ratio was 8.2 percent at June 30, 2006, and at March 31, 2006, and 7.5 percent at June 30, 2005. Tangible common equity to assets was 5.6 percent at June 30, 2006, compared with 5.4 percent at March 31, 2006, and 6.1 percent at June 30, 2005. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of stated "well capitalized" requirements.

Lines of Business
     Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business, which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Wealth Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is available and is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer base. During 2006, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results have been restated and presented on a comparable basis.
     Wholesale Banking offers lending, depository, treasury management and other financial services to middle market, large corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking contributed $298 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2006, a 2.1 percent increase over the same period of 2005 and relatively flat as compared with the first quarter of 2006. The increase in Wholesale Banking's second quarter 2006 contribution over the same quarter of 2005 was the result of a favorable variance in total net revenue (3.1 percent). The favorable
(More)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2006 Results July 18, 2006 Page 19
variance in total net revenue year-over-year was the result of growth in net interest income (3.2 percent) and total noninterest income (2.7 percent). The increase in net interest income was driven primarily by loan growth (5.9 percent) and the margin benefit of deposits partially offset by tighter credit spreads. The increase in total noninterest income was due primarily to increases in commercial lease income and foreign exchange trading revenue. These positive variances were partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses which primarily reflected lower recoveries compared with a year ago.
     Wholesale Banking's contribution to net income in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2006 was relatively flat as a favorable variance in total net revenue (1.0 percent) was substantially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses. Total net revenue was higher on a linked quarter basis due primarily to an increase in net interest income (1.3 percent). The favorable variance in net interest income was primarily due to seasonally higher deposit balances and the benefit from wider deposit spreads. Total noninterest income on a linked quarter basis was flat as increases in commercial lease revenue and seasonally higher treasury management fees were offset by a decrease in income related to equity investments. Net charge-offs increased compared with first quarter of 2006 due to lower commercial recoveries, which drove the unfavorable variance in the provision for credit losses quarter-over-quarter.
     Consumer Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail and ATMs. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, in-store banking, small business banking, consumer lending, mortgage banking, consumer finance, workplace banking, student banking, and 24-hour banking. Consumer Banking contributed $488 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2006, a 13.8 percent increase over the same period of 2005 and an 18.7 percent increase from the prior quarter. The favorable increase year-over-year was the result of higher total net revenue (1.6 percent), a reduction in total noninterest expense (9.1 percent) and lower provision for credit losses (14.3 percent). Total net revenue was higher than the same quarter of 2005 due to growth in net interest income (2.0 percent) and a modest increase in noninterest income (.6 percent). Net interest income was higher year-over-year primarily due to growth in average loan balances of 8.6 percent and the margin benefit of deposits, somewhat offset by lower spreads on those assets given the competitive lending environment. Noninterest income was relatively flat in the second quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period of 2005. A reduction in mortgage banking revenue, primarily

due to adopting fair value accounting for mortgage servicing rights in the first quarter of 2006, was offset by strong growth in deposit service charges due to increased transaction-related fees and other revenue resulting from improving end-of-term retail lease residual values. Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2006 was lower compared with the same quarter of 2005 due to the elimination of mortgage servicing rights amortization under SFAS 156 which resulted in a decrease in other intangible expense of $52 million. In addition there was a favorable variance in net shared services expense (6.1 percent). A $9 million year-over-year decrease in net charge-offs (14.3 percent), primarily related to the impact of the new bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of 2005, drove the favorable variance in the business line's provision for credit losses.
     The increase in Consumer Banking's contribution in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006 was the result of favorable variances in all categories. The increase in total net revenue was due primarily to an increase in total noninterest income (21.4 percent) which reflected an increase mortgage banking revenue and higher deposit service fees. In addition, lower gains from the sales of student loans were offset by improved retail leasing revenue. Noninterest expense was lower, on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to a favorable variance in net shared services expense partially offset by an increase in marketing and business development expense. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was due to a $9 million decrease in net charge-offs, primarily related to the continuing impact of new bankruptcy legislation.
     Wealth Management provides trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment management, insurance, custody and mutual fund servicing through six businesses: Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, U.S. Bancorp Investments and Insurance, FAF Advisors, Institutional Trust and Custody and Fund Services. Wealth Management contributed $148 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2006, 27.6 percent higher than the same period of 2005 and 10.4 percent higher than the first quarter of 2006. The increase in the business line's contribution in the second quarter of 2006 over the same quarter of 2005 was the result of a favorable variance in total net revenue (21.6 percent) partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (17.5 percent). Net interest income was favorably impacted year-over-year by wider deposit spreads and growth in deposit balances. Noninterest income increased by 22.2 percent from the same quarter of 2005, primarily due to improved equity market conditions, incremental growth in customer accounts and balances and the acquisition of the corporate and institutional trust business of Wachovia Corporation. The increase in total noninterest expense was primarily due to the recent

acquisition. The increase in the business line's contribution in the second quarter of 2006, as compared with the first quarter of 2006, was due primarily to seasonally higher trust and investment management fees and core account growth.
     Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $251 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2006, a 37.2 percent increase from the same period of 2005 and a 12.6 percent increase from the first quarter of 2006. The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the second quarter of 2006 from the same period of 2005 was the result of higher total net revenue (18.8 percent) and a $27 million favorable variance in the provision for credit losses (29.3 percent), partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense (15.8 percent). The increase in total net revenue year-over-year was due to growth in total noninterest income (19.6 percent) and net interest income (15.6 percent), reflecting growth in higher yielding retail loan balances, partially offset by increases in noninterest-bearing corporate card balances. All revenue categories benefited from higher transaction volumes, rate changes and business expansion initiatives. The growth in total noninterest expense year-over-year primarily reflected new business initiatives, including costs associated with acquisitions and other business growth initiatives. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was driven by lower net charge-offs, year-over-year, reflecting the continuing near-term impact of changes in bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of 2005.
     The increase in Payment Services' contribution in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006 was due to improved noninterest income (10.8 percent), partially offset by increased provision for credit losses (8.3 percent) and a modest increase in total noninterest expense (2.6 percent). The increase in noninterest income was due to seasonally higher volumes in credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue. In addition, merchant processing services was favorably impacted by a recent business acquisition. The increase in total noninterest expense was primarily due to the timing of marketing programs and the impact of acquisitions on various expenses including compensation and employee benefits and other intangible expense.
     Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis.

the adoption of SFAS 156, changes in mortgage servicing rights valuations due to interest rate changes were managed at a corporate level and, as such, reported within this business unit. Operational expenses incurred by Treasury and Corporate Support on behalf of the other business lines are allocated back to the appropriate business unit, primarily based on customer transaction volume and account activities, deposit balances and employee levels and are identified as net shared services expense. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net income of $16 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared with net income of $101 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $85 million in the first quarter of 2006. The decrease in net income in the current quarter from the second quarter of 2005 was caused by an unfavorable change in net interest income ($140 million) reflecting the impact of a flatter yield curve and asset/liability management decisions during the past year, including reducing the investment securities portfolio, changes in interest rate derivative positions and the issuance of higher cost wholesale funding. The adverse impact of net interest income was offset somewhat by growth in noninterest income resulting from the gain on the MasterCard IPO. In addition, the favorable change in noninterest expense was due primarily to lower debt prepayment expense and the mortgage servicing rights impairment recorded in the second quarter of 2005. The unfavorable change in income taxes from a year ago resulted from the $94 million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2005. Net income in the second quarter of 2006 was lower than net income in the first quarter of 2006 due to lower net interest income ($47 million) driven by the flatter yield curve and funding earning asset growth with wholesale funding. In addition, the lower contribution of this line of business reflects lower noninterest income ($25 million) due primarily to certain interest rate swap gains recognized in the first quarter of 2006, partially offset by the MasterCard IPO gain and higher noninterest expense ($34 million) primarily related to a debt restructuring charge and higher net shared services expense.
