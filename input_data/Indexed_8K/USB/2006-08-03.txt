Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 3, 2006, Jerry A. Grundhofer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Bancorp, established a plan to exercise certain stock options and sell the underlying shares on a regular quarterly basis. The plan is a nondiscretionary plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Grundhofer recently announced that he would retire from employment with the company on December 31, 2006. Under the terms of the option agreements governing certain of Mr. Grundhofers outstanding options, these options would expire on December 31, 2007, as a consequence of Mr. Grundhofers retirement. These options must be exercised prior to their expiration date or they will expire worthless. Mr. Grundhofer has entered into the plan in order to provide for an orderly liquidation of these options prior to their upcoming expiration date. Rule 10b5-1(c) plans permit executive officers to sell shares on a predetermined, regular basis so that the re sulting sales will not be deemed to violate Rule 10b-5 on the basis that they are made on the basis of material nonpublic information. Under the plan, Mr. Grundhofer will exercise stock options for a total of 3,362,712 shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock and sell one-fifth of such shares each quarter for five successive quarters, with the sales to occur over a three-day period beginning three trading days after the public release of U.S. Bancorps quarterly or annual financial results, beginning in the third quarter of 2006. The exercise prices for the options, which were established contractually when the options were granted, range from $18.79 to $21.54 per share. A portion of the sale proceeds will be used to pay the exercise price of the options.
