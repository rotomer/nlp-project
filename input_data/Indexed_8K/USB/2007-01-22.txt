Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On January 16, 2007, U.S. Bancorps Board of Directors approved a number of amendments to the companys Restated Bylaws. Certain of these amendments relate to the elimination of the companys classified Board of Directors that will be proposed to the shareholders for approval at the companys 2007 annual meeting of shareholders, and correspond to the changes to the companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would effectuate the declassified board if approved by the shareholders. The other changes accommodate changes in the companys structure and governance function since the bylaws were last amended. None of the amendments will be effective until April 17, 2007; however, the amendments related to declassifying the companys Board of Directors will only become effective if and when the companys shareholders approve the companys proposal to amend the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to provide for the annual election of directors. The description below of the amendments to the Restated Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by the companys Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Bylaws attached as Exhibit 3.2 include the amendments contemplating the annual election of directors, which are contingent upon the companys shareholders approving the corresponding amendments to the companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation. There is no assurance that such approval will occur. The amendments to the Bylaws include amendments to:  Article II, Section 6; to specify that only one inspector of election is required at shareholders meetings;  Article III, Sections 1 and 2; to implement the annual election of directors;  Article III, Sections 4 and 5; to clarify who may call special board meetings and the appropriate means of notice;  Article III, Section 9; to specify that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall determine director compensation;  Article IV, Section 1; to update the composition and chairmanship of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors;  Article V; to clarify and update who presides at meetings of the Board of Directors and meetings of the companys shareholders and to remove provisions relating to appointment of staff and divisional officers;  Article VI, Section 3; to clarify that the companys then current Stock Incentive Plan shall be used to define "Change of Control of the Corporation" for the purposes of the procedures relating to indemnification;  Article VII, Sections 1 and 3; to update certain procedures relating to issuance of certificates representing company shares; and  Article X; to update the appropriate means of notice for emergency meetings of the Board of Directors.

provided
however
Section 2.   
Advancement of Expenses.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VI shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Corporation within 20 days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time; , , that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director, advisory director or officer in his or her capacity as a director, advisory director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director, advisory director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director, advisory director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director, advisory director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.
provided
however
Section 3.   
Procedure for Indemnification.
To obtain indemnification under this Article VI, a claimant shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (1) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (2) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum, or by a majority vote of a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) if there are no Disinterested Directors or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (iii) if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement to the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a "Change of Control of the Corporation" as defined in the company's then-current Stock Incentive Plan, in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after such determination.
Section 4.   
Certain Remedies.
If a claim under Section 1 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim pursuant to Section 3 of this Article VI has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 5.   
Binding Effect.
If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 3 of this Article VI that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 4 of this Article VI.
Section 6.   
Validity of this Article VI.
The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Section 4 of this Article VI that the procedures and presumptions of this Article VI are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article VI.
Section 7.   
Nonexclusivity, etc.
The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of this Article VI shall in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any present or former director, advisory director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or any predecessor thereof hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.
Section 8.   
Insurance.
The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. To the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such director or officer, and each such agent or employee to whom rights to indemnification have been granted as provided in Section 9 of this Article VI, shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for any such director, officer, employee or agent.
Section 9.   
Indemnification of Other Persons.
The Corporation may grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any present or former employee or agent of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, advisory directors and officers of the Corporation.
Section 10.   
Severability.
If any provision or provisions of this Article VI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Section 11.   
Certain Definitions.
For purposes of this Article VI:
(1) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Corporation who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant.
(2) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an independent practitioner that is experienced in matters of corporation law and shall include any such person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the claimant in an action to determine the claimant's rights under this Article VI.
Section 12.   
Notices.
Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to the Corporation under this Article VI shall be in writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram, overnight mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Corporation and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Secretary.
