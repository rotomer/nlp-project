Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On January 31, 2007, U.S. Bancorp, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), issued a news release announcing that it had priced a private placement of $3 billion aggregate principal amount of its floating rate convertible senior debentures due 2037 (the "Convertible Debentures"). The initial purchaser of the Convertible Debentures also has an option to purchase up to an additional $450 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Debentures within 21 days solely to cover overallotments. The sale of the Convertible Debentures closed on February 6, 2007. The Convertible Debentures were issued to the initial purchaser pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and will be resold by the initial purchaser to "qualified institutional buyers" in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The initial purchaser will receive aggregate purchase discounts or commissions of $22.5 million ($28.875 million if the overallotment option is exercised in full).
The Convertible Debentures bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR, reset quarterly, minus 1.75%; provided that such rate will never be less than zero percent per annum. Interest on the Convertible Debentures is payable quarterly in arrears on February 6, May 6, August 6 and November 6 of each year, beginning May 6, 2007, until February 6, 2032. After that date, interest will cease to be paid and holders will instead receive the accreted principal amount of a Convertible Debenture, which will be equal to the original principal amount of $1,000 per Convertible Debenture, increased daily by a variable yield beginning on February 7, 2032.
All or any portion of the Convertible Debentures may be converted at any time on or prior to February 6, 2037. If converted, holders of the Convertible Debentures will receive cash up to the principal amount of a Convertible Debenture and, if the market price of the Company's common stock exceeds the conversion price in effect on the conversion date, holders will also receive a number of shares of Company common stock per Convertible Debenture as determined pursuant to a specified formula, subject to the Company's option to cash settle all or some of its delivery obligations. The Convertible Debentures have an initial conversion rate of 24.4260, representing an initial conversion premium of approximately 15% over the Company's closing common stock price on January 31, 2007 of $35.60 per share. Accordingly, unless and until the market price of the Company's common stock exceeds the conversion price in effect on the conversion date, holders of the Convertible Debentures will not be entitled to receive any shares of the Company's common stock upon conversion.
