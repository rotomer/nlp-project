     DATE: July 22, 2009

Exhibit 99.1
     U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $471 million for the second quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per common share of $.12 in the current quarter were lower than the $.53 and $.24 diluted earnings per common share in the second quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, respectively. Significant items impacting the second quarter of 2009 results included an FDIC special assessment equal to $.05 per diluted common share and the accelerated amortization of the discount associated with the TARP preferred stock ("deemed dividend") redeemed on June 17, 2009, equal to $.08 per diluted common share. In addition, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs equal to $.20 per diluted common share. Results for the second quarter were driven by record total net revenue of $4.2 billion due to strong year-over-year growth in net interest income and record mortgage banking revenue. Highlights for the second quarter of 2009 included:

     U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $471 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $950 million for the second quarter of 2008 and $529 million for the first quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per common share of $.12 in the second quarter of 2009 were $.41 lower than second quarter of 2008 and $.12 lower on a linked quarter basis. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were .71 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2009, compared with 1.58 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2008. Significant items in the second quarter of 2009 results included a $123 million accrual for an FDIC special assessment to be paid in the third quarter of 2009, $19 million ($.01 per diluted common share) of net securities losses and the $154 million deemed dividend associated with the TARP redemption. In addition, the Company continued to strengthen its allowance for credit losses by recording $466 million of provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs to reflect continued credit deterioration given the current economic environment. These significant items, in total, reduced second quarter of 2009 diluted earnings per common share by approximately $.34. In the second quarter of 2008, significant items reduced diluted earnings per common share by approximately $.11, including provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $200 million and net securities losses of $63 million. In the first quarter of 2009, significant items included provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $530 million, net securities losses of $198 million and a $92 million gain from a corporate real estate transaction. In total, these significant items reduced first quarter of 2009 diluted earnings per common share by approximately $.28.

     U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "Today we reported the Company's second quarter earnings which, although lower than the same quarter of 2008 and the prior quarter, continued to demonstrate U.S. Bancorp's core earnings strength during a period of unsurpassed challenges and economic stress for the financial services industry. I am proud of our earnings for the second quarter, but I am more proud of the Company's ability to produce these results while navigating through the regulatory and market hurdles necessary to emerge as one of the country's strongest institutions.
     "The Company achieved record net revenue of $4.2 billion in the second quarter, as we experienced growth in our balance sheet and fee-based businesses. Our balance sheet businesses have capitalized on the "flight to quality" over the past number of quarters, adding loan and deposit customers and balances, leading to growth in net interest income. In addition to record mortgage loan production of over $16 billion this quarter, we originated more than $4 billion of new consumer loans and over $25 billion of new and renewed commercial and commercial real estate commitments. I am especially pleased with the positive growth trends in deposits as it is further evidence that our Company is viewed as one of the safest and most stable institutions in the country. Our fee revenue in the second quarter also benefited significantly from the flow of new mortgage activity, as well as our strong payments, trust, corporate and commercial fee-related businesses. Expenses this quarter were well-contained, with the increase year-over-year almost entirely due to higher FDIC insurance costs and acquisitions. The Company-wide five percent expense contingency plans are now fully implemented and contributing to the Company's controlled expense levels and bottom line results. Importantly, on a year-over-year basis, the Company experienced positive core operating leverage.
     "During the second quarter, a number of events occurred that were of particular significance to our shareholders, customers, and, in fact, our Company as a whole, and the sequence of these events culminated on June 17 with the redemption of the $6.6 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. Prior to obtaining permission to redeem the TARP funds, our Company was required to complete a number of prescribed steps, including passing the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or "stress test," issuing non-guaranteed debt and completing a common stock offering. On May 8 we announced that we had passed the stress test and within a week of that announcement successfully issued $1 billion of non-guaranteed debt and approximately $2.7 billion of new common equity. I am exceedingly proud of our Company's stress test results, which were ranked the best among our peers in the categories of

"Resources to Absorb Losses to Risk-Weighted Assets" and "Total Loan Loss Rates," as well as the success we had in raising non-guaranteed debt at very attractive spreads and, finally, our ability to raise common equity in a well-received offering. Lastly, on July 15, we repurchased the 10-year warrant that was issued in conjunction with the preferred stock, effectively concluding our participation in the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program. All of these significant events and successful outcomes further validated the strength and stability of U.S. Bancorp.
th
     "Our capital position remains strong with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.4 percent at June 30, 2009, above the 6.0 percent well-capitalized ratio as defined by the regulators. In addition, the issuance of new common equity strengthened the Tier 1 common equity ratio from 5.4 percent at March 31, 2009, to 6.7 percent at June 30, 2009. Our capital position is solid and it provides a strong base of support at this point in the cycle for our on-going operations, including lending activity and growth initiatives.
     "Credit costs, as expected, continued to have a negative impact on earnings in the second quarter, but the rate of growth on a linked quarter basis in both dollars of net charge-offs and nonperforming assets moderated. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we added to the reserve for credit losses. Specifically, incremental provision expense was approximately 50 percent of net charge-offs in the second quarter versus approximately 67 percent of net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2009. The additional provision expense led to a rise in the allowance for credit losses as a percent of period end loans to 2.51 percent at June 30, 2009, from 2.23 percent at March 31, 2009. We expect to continue to build reserves until we see consistent evidence of a leveling-off or decline in net charge-offs. As the results of the stress test indicated, we have the capital and earnings power to cover future losses, even under more adverse economic conditions.
     "Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their support, hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities during these very stressful times. I would also like to thank the taxpayers for their investment in our Company over the past eight months, as the financial markets were calmed via government actions and support.
     "Although the challenges continue and some uncertainty remains in the economy as a whole, our Company is focused on the future and on every opportunity to capitalize on the strength of our balance sheet, the breadth of our franchise and the depth of our diversified mix of businesses. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers, support our communities and employees and assist the government in their efforts to stimulate the economy, while creating long-term value for our shareholders."

     The Company's net income for the second quarter of 2009 decreased by $479 million (50.4 percent) from the same period of 2008 and by $58 million (11.0 percent) on a linked quarter basis. The reduction in net income year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis was principally the result of an increase in the provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense due principally to the FDIC special assessment and acquisition costs, partially offset by a favorable variance in total net revenue.
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the second quarter of 2009 was $4,159 million; $359 million (9.4 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2008, reflecting a 10.3 percent increase in net interest income and an 8.6 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was the result of growth in average earning assets. Noninterest income increased over a year ago, principally due to strong growth in mortgage banking revenue, higher commercial products revenue and lower net securities losses, partially offset by lower payments-related revenue, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, all of which were affected by the impact of the slowing economy on equity markets and consumer spending. Additionally, the current quarter was impacted by declining valuations of equity investments. Noninterest income on a linked quarter basis was higher primarily due to mortgage banking revenue, seasonally higher deposit service charges and payments-related revenue, along with lower net securities losses, partially offset by the $92 million gain from a corporate real estate transaction recorded in the first quarter of 2009.
     Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2009 was $2,129 million; $311 million (17.1 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2008, and $258 million (13.8 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2009. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to higher FDIC deposit insurance expense, including the $123 million special assessment, marketing and litigation related-costs and acquisitions, which were partially offset by focused reductions in costs as a result of the implementation of the Company's cost containment plan in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in total noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was due to higher FDIC deposit insurance expense, marketing expense, business integration and litigation related-costs, partially offset by cost containment activities.
     The Company's provision for credit losses reflected current adverse economic conditions. The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2009 was $1,395 million, an increase of $77 million over the first quarter of 2009 and $799 million over the second quarter of 2008. The provision for credit losses exceeded net charge-offs by $466 million in the second quarter of 2009, $530 million in the first quarter of 2009, and $200 million in the second quarter of 2008. The increase in the provision for credit losses

U.S. Bancorp Reports Second Quarter 2009 Results July 22, 2009 Page 7
reflected continuing stress in residential real estate markets, driven by declining home prices in most geographic regions. It also reflected deteriorating economic conditions and the corresponding impact on the commercial, commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2009 were $929 million, compared with $788 million in the first quarter of 2009 and $396 million in the second quarter of 2008. Given current economic conditions and the continuing weakness in home prices and the economy in general, the Company expects net charge-offs will remain elevated for the remainder of 2009.
     Nonperforming assets were $4,016 million at June 30, 2009, compared with $3,410 million at March 31, 2009, and $1,135 million at June 30, 2008. At June 30, 2009, $10.5 billion of the Company's assets were covered by loss sharing agreements ("covered assets"), including $682 million of nonperforming assets, compared with $702 million of nonperforming covered assets at March 31, 2009. The majority of these covered nonperforming assets were considered credit-impaired at acquisition and were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The remaining linked quarter and year-over-year increase in nonperforming assets was driven by continuing stress in residential home construction and related industries, as well as the residential mortgage portfolio, an increase in foreclosed properties, and the impact of the economic slowdown on commercial customers. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered assets, was 2.66 percent at June 30, 2009, compared with 2.37 percent at March 31, 2009, and 1.60 percent at June 30, 2008. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered assets, was 2.51 percent at June 30, 2009, compared with 2.23 percent at March 31, 2009. The Company anticipates that nonperforming assets will continue to increase during 2009 as economic conditions affect an increasing number of borrowers in both the commercial and consumer loan categories.

Net Interest Income
     Second quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $2,104 million, compared with $1,908 million in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of $196 million (10.3 percent). The increase was primarily the result of growth in average earning assets. Average earning assets were higher by $22.2 billion (10.5 percent) than the second quarter of 2008, driven by an increase of $20.8 billion (12.8 percent) in average loans. During the second quarter of 2009, the net interest margin was 3.60 percent compared with 3.61 percent in the second quarter of 2008 and 3.59 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Net interest income remained relatively flat on a linked quarter basis. Given the current interest rate environment, the net interest margin is expected to remain relatively stable for the remainder of 2009.

     Total average loans, excluding covered assets, were $10.1 billion (6.2 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2009 than the second quarter of 2008, driven by growth in most loan categories. Average total retail loans grew $6.1 billion, total commercial real estate loans grew $3.3 billion, residential mortgages grew $657 million and total commercial loans grew $80 million. Retail loan growth, year-over-year, was driven by increases in credit cards, home equity lines and federally-guaranteed student loansTotal average loans, excluding covered assets, were $1.2 billion (.7 percent) lower in the second quarter of 2009 than the first quarter of 2009, as increases in credit card (5.4 percent) and commercial real estate loans (1.0 percent) were more than offset by a decline in total commercial loans (3.7 percent) primarily due to reductions in commitment utilization by corporate borrowers. Average covered assets related to the November 2008 acquisitions of Downey Savings & Loan Association, F.A. and PFF Bank and Trust ("Downey" and "PFF", respectively) were $10.7 billion in the second quarter of 2009 compared with $11.3 billion in the first quarter of 2009.

     Average investment securities in the second quarter of 2009 were $810 million (1.9 percent) lower than the second quarter of 2008 and slightly lower (.3 percent) than the first quarter of 2009. The composition of the Company's investment portfolio remained principally the same.
     Average total deposits for the second quarter of 2009 increased $27.4 billion (20.2 percent) over the second quarter of 2008. Excluding deposits from 2008 acquisitions (Mellon 1 Business BankDowney and PFF) and the FDIC-assisted First Bank of Idaho acquisition in April of 2009, average total deposits increased $15.1 billion (11.2 percent) over the second quarter of 2008. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $9.5 billion (34.2 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to growth in the Consumer and Wholesale Banking business lines and the impact of acquisitions. Average total savings deposits were higher year-over-year by $12.6 billion (19.7 percent) with increases in all categories, the result of growth in Consumer Banking, government, broker-dealer and institutional trust customers and the impact of acquisitions. Contributing to the increase in savings accounts was strong participation in a new savings product introduced nation-wide by Consumer Banking late in the third quarter of 2008. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were higher year-over-year by $5.3 billion (42.2 percent) primarily due to acquisitions, while average time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased slightly (.3 percent), as the favorable variance from acquisitions was offset by the impact of wholesale funding decisions.

prior quarter primarily due to increases in the Consumer and Wholesale business lines. Total average savings deposits increased $6.6 billion (9.4 percent) over the first quarter of 2009, with increases in interest checking and savings balances, partially offset by a decrease in money market balances. This growth was principally the result of increases in corporate and institutional trust, broker-dealer and government balances, as well as continuing strong participation in the new savings product introduced by Consumer Banking late in the third quarter 2008. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 decreased slightly (.9 percent) from the prior quarter, while average time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased by $5.1 billion (14.2 percent) from the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the Company's reduction in wholesale funding needs as a result of core deposit growth.

Noninterest Income
     Second quarter noninterest income was $2,055 million; $163 million (8.6 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2008 and $267 million (14.9 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2009. Noninterest income increased over the second quarter of 2008 due to a significant rise in mortgage banking revenue as the lower rate environment drove record mortgage loan production and increased profitability on loan sales. Noninterest income also benefited from higher ATM processing services of $11 million (11.8 percent) related to growth in transaction volumes and business expansion, an increase in treasury management fees of $5 million (3.6 percent) as transaction volumes grew, and an increase in commercial products revenue of $27 million (23.1 percent) due to higher letter of credit, capital markets and other commercial loan fees. Net securities losses were lower than a year ago by $44 million (69.8 percent), due to lower impairment charges and higher net securities gains. Fee-based revenue in certain categories decreased year-over-year because of weaker economic conditions, which adversely impacted consumer and business spending. Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and merchant processing services revenue were lower in the second quarter of 2009 than the second quarter of 2008 by $7 million (2.6 percent), $6 million (3.4 percent) and $31 million (10.0 percent), respectively, as transaction volumes declined. Deposit service charges decreased $28 million (10.1 percent), primarily due to lower overdraft fees, with a decrease in the number of overdraft incidences more than offsetting account growth. Trust and investment management fees declined $46 million (13.1 percent) and investment products fees and commissions declined $10 million (27.0 percent) with both variances reflecting adverse equity market conditions. Other income decreased $23 million (20.4 percent), mainly due to declining valuations of equity investments.
     Noninterest income was higher by $267 million (14.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2009 than the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the strong mortgage banking production environment during the current quarter and lower net securities losses. Mortgage banking revenue increased $75 million, with approximately $22 billion in applications received and over $16 billion in loans closed. The Company sells the majority of these loans to government-sponsored enterprises. Corporate payment products revenue and merchant processing services revenue increased $14 million (9.1 percent) and $20 million (7.8 percent) due primarily to seasonally higher sales volumes and improved pricing. Trust and investment management fees were higher by $10 million (3.4 percent) chiefly due to seasonal tax preparation fees. Deposit service charges and treasury management fees were $24 million (10.6 percent) and $5 million (3.6 percent) higher

on a linked quarter basis, respectively, principally due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Net securities losses were $179 million lower due primarily to lower other-than-temporary impairments. Partially offsetting these positive variances was a reduction in other income of $79 million (46.7 percent) largely reflecting the first quarter of 2009 gain from a corporate real estate transaction.
Noninterest Expense
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2009 totaled $2,129 million, an increase of $311 million (17.1 percent) over the second quarter of 2008 and an increase of $258 million (13.8 percent) over the first quarter of 2009. The increase in noninterest expense from a year ago was principally due to the impact of higher FDIC deposit insurance expense and bank acquisitions. Compensation expense increased $3 million (.4 percent) over the second quarter of 2008 as increases due to acquisitions were offset by reductions from cost containment efforts. Employee benefits expense increased $11 million (8.5 percent) reflecting higher pension costs associated with previous period declines in the value of pension assets. Net occupancy and equipment expense and technology and communications expense rose by $18 million (9.5 percent) and $8 million (5.4 percent), respectively, over the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to acquisitions, as well as branch-based and other business expansion initiatives. Marketing and business development expense was higher by $14 million (21.2 percent) due to costs related to new credit card product initiatives. Other intangibles expense increased $8 million (9.2 percent) due to acquisitions. An increase in other expense of $250 million (82.2 percent) was mainly due to higher FDIC deposit insurance expense, the result of the

current quarter's special assessment and the use of assessment credits in the second quarter of 2008. In addition, other expense included increased costs for other real estate owned, mortgage servicing, litigation and acquisition integration.
     Noninterest expense increased $258 million (13.8 percent) in the second quarter of 2009 over the first quarter of 2009. Marketing and business development expense was higher by $24 million (42.9 percent) due to new credit card product initiatives and the timing of other product campaigns. Other expense rose by $263 million (90.4 percent) on a linked quarter basis due to increased FDIC deposit insurance expense, as well as increased costs for other real estate owned, mortgage servicing, litigation and acquisition integration. Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were declines in compensation and employee benefits expenses of $22 million (2.8 percent) and $15 million (9.7 percent), respectively. Compensation expense decreased due to the impact of the cost containment plan. Employee benefits expense decreased due to seasonally lower payroll taxes.
Provision for Income Taxes
     The provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2009 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 23.6 percent (effective tax rate of 17.1 percent) compared with 30.2 percent (effective tax rate of 28.5 percent) in the second quarter of 2008 and 21.5 percent (effective tax rate of 15.6 percent) in the first quarter of 2009. The decline in the effective tax rate as compared with the same quarter of 2008 reflects the marginal impact of the decline in pretax earnings.

Credit Quality
     During the second quarter of 2009, credit losses and nonperforming assets continued to trend higher, but at a more moderate rate, reflecting the adverse recessionary impacts of the current economic environment. The allowance for credit losses was $4,571 million at June 30, 2009, compared with $4,105 million at March 31, 2009, and $2,648 million at June 30, 2008. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2009 were

$929 million, compared with $788 million in the first quarter of 2009, and $396 million in the second quarter of 2008. The increase in total net charge-offs compared with a year ago was driven by factors affecting the residential housing markets, including homebuilding and related industries, and credit costs associated with credit card and other consumer and commercial loans as the economy weakened. As a result of the continued stress in the residential housing markets, homebuilding and related industry sectors, and increasing weakness in other commercial, commercial real estate and consumer portfolios, the Company recorded $466 million of provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs, increasing the allowance for credit losses during the second quarter of 2009.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs increased to $353 million in the second quarter of 2009 (1.61 percent of average loans outstanding) compared with $297 million (1.35 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2009 and $87 million (.41 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2008. This increasing trend reflected continuing stress in housing, especially residential homebuilding and related industry sectors, along with the impact of the deteriorating economic conditions on commercial loan portfolios.
     Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs increased to $116 million in the second quarter of 2009 (1.94 percent of average loans outstanding) compared with $91 million (1.54 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2009 and $53 million (.91 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2008. Total retail loan net charge-offs were $458 million (2.99 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2009 compared with $394 million (2.62 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2009 and $256 million (1.86 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2008. The increased residential mortgage and retail loan credit losses reflected the adverse impact of current economic conditions on consumers, as rising unemployment levels increased losses in prime-based residential portfolios.
     The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.51 percent (2.66 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2009, compared with 2.23 percent (2.37 percent excluding covered assets) at March 31, 2009, and 1.60 percent at June 30, 2008. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 124 percent (152 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2009, compared with 131 percent (169 percent excluding covered assets) at March 31, 2009, and 273 percent at June 30, 2008.

     Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2009, totaled $4,016 million, compared with $3,410 million at March 31, 2009, and $1,135 million at June 30, 2008. Included in June 30, 2009, nonperforming assets were $682 million of covered assets. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 2.20 percent (1.94 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2009, compared with 1.85 percent (1.56 percent excluding covered assets) at March 31, 2009, and .68 percent at June 30, 2008. The increase in nonperforming assets compared with a year ago was driven primarily by the residential construction portfolio and related industries, as well as the residential mortgage portfolio, an increase in foreclosed residential properties and the impact of the economic slowdown on other commercial customers. The Company expects nonperforming assets to continue to increase as difficult economic conditions affect more borrowers within both consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due

increased to $2,042 million ($1,245 million excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2009, compared with $1,932 million ($1,185 million excluding covered assets) at March 31, 2009, and $687 million at June 30, 2008. The year-over-year increase in delinquent loans that continue to accrue interest was primarily related to loans acquired under loss sharing arrangements. The increase excluding covered assets of $558 million reflected stress in residential mortgages, commercial, construction, credit cards, and home equity loans. Restructured loans that continue to accrue interest have also increased compared with the second quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the impact of loan modifications for certain residential mortgage customers in light of current economic conditions. The Company expects this trend to continue as the Company works to modify loans for borrowers who are having financial difficulties.
     Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders' equity was $24.2 billion at June 30, 2009, compared with $27.2 billion at March 31, 2009, and $21.8 billion at June 30, 2008. The reduction from the first quarter of 2009 was due to the current quarter redemption of $6.6 billion of preferred stock previously held by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, partially offset by approximately $2.7 billion (153 million shares) raised from a public offering of common stock. The Company issued the preferred stock and warrant to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in the fourth quarter of 2008. With the full redemption of the preferred stock, only the warrant remained outstanding at June 30, 2009. The Company repurchased the warrant on July 15, 2009, for $139 million. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.4 percent at June 30, 2009, compared with 10.9 percent at March 31, 2009, and 8.5 percent at June 30, 2008. The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 6.7 percent at June 30, 2009, compared with 5.4 percent at March 31, 2009, and 5.6 percent at June 30, 2008.

Tangible common equity divided by tangible assets was 5.1 percent at June 30, 2009, compared with 3.8 percent at March 31, 2009, and 4.6 percent at June 30, 2008. All regulatory ratios continue to be in excess of "well-capitalized" requirements.
 
Lines of Business
     The Company's major lines of business are Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Wealth Management & Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those

services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company's diverse customer base. During 2009, line of business results were restated and presented on a comparable basis for organization and methodology changes to more closely align capital allocation with Basel II requirements and to allocate the provision for credit losses based on net charge-offs and changes in the risks of specific loan portfolios. Previously, the provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs remained in Treasury and Corporate Support, and the other lines of business' results included only the portion of the provision for credit losses equal to net charge-offs.
     offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository, treasury management, capital markets, foreign exchange, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking recorded net income of $107 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with $280 million of net income in the second quarter of 2008 and $19 million of net income in the first quarter of 2009. Stronger total net revenue year-over-year was more than offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses and an increase in total noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $53 million (11.1 percent) year-over-year due to strong growth in average earning assets and deposits, partially offset by the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Total noninterest income increased $8 million (3.4 percent) as growth in treasury management, letters of credit, commercial loan, capital markets and foreign exchange fees was partially offset by declining valuations on equity investments and commercial leasing activities. Total noninterest expense increased by $15 million (5.6 percent) over a year ago primarily due to an increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense. The provision for credit losses was $319 million higher year-over-year due to an increase in net charge-offs and continued deterioration in the credit quality of commercial and commercial real estate loans.
Wholesale Banking
     Wholesale Banking's contribution to net income in the second quarter of 2009 was $88 million higher than the first quarter of 2009. The increase was principally due to lower provision for credit losses. Although net charge-offs increased $43 million on a linked quarter basis, the deterioration of credit quality moderated somewhat relative to the previous quarter. Total net revenue was higher on a linked quarter basis due to an increase in total noninterest income (14.2 percent), partially offset by a decrease in net interest

income (1.7 percent). The increase in total noninterest income was due to higher treasury management fees and higher commercial products revenue including, standby letters of credit, syndication, capital markets and other loan fees. In addition, equity investment valuation losses were lower than the first quarter of 2009. The decline in net interest income was due to lower average loan balances, reflecting lower commitment utilization by wholesale customers and the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by growth in average deposit balances and improved spreads on new loan activity. Total noninterest expense increased $18 million (6.8 percent) due to higher FDIC deposit insurance expense and seasonally higher processing costs.
     delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail and ATM processing. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, in-store banking, small business banking, consumer lending, mortgage banking, consumer finance, workplace banking, student banking and 24-hour banking. Consumer Banking contributed $172 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2009, a $47 million (21.5 percent) decrease from the second quarter of 2008, and a $38 million (18.1 percent) decrease from the prior quarter. Within Consumer Banking, the retail banking division accounted for $10 million of the total contribution, 94.5 percent below the same quarter of last year and an 88.2 percent decrease on a linked quarter basis. The decrease in the retail banking division from the same period of 2008 was due to an increase in the provision for credit losses and an increase in total noninterest expense. Net interest income for the retail banking division increased $15 million (1.7 percent) year-over-year as higher average loan and deposit balances, including the impact of Downey and PFF, and yield-related loan fees were partially offset by a reduction in the margin benefit from deposits in a declining interest rate environment. Total noninterest income for the retail banking division decreased $14 million (2.8 percent) from a year ago due to lower deposit service charges, trust and investment management fees and equity investment revenue. This decrease was partially offset by growth in ATM processing services fees, a gain on sale of student loans and lower retail lease residual losses. Total noninterest expense for the division in the second quarter of 2009 was 14.1 percent higher year-over-year, principally due to acquisitions and higher FDIC deposit insurance expense. The provision for credit losses for the retail banking division increased due to year-over-year growth in net charge-offs and continued stress in residential mortgages, home equity and other installment and consumer loan portfolios. In the second quarter of 2009, the mortgage banking division's contribution was $162 million, a $125 million increase over the second quarter of 2008. The increase in the mortgage banking division's contribution was the result

of higher total net revenue, partially offset by higher total noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. The division's total net revenue increased by $263 million over a year ago, reflecting record mortgage loan production, improved loan sale profitability and an increase in net interest income. Total noninterest expense for the mortgage banking division increased $42 million (53.8 percent) over the second quarter of 2008 primarily due to higher production levels over a year ago and servicing costs associated with other real estate owned and foreclosures.
     Consumer Banking's contribution in the second quarter of 2009 was lower by $38 million (18.1 percent) than the first quarter of 2009 as strong mortgage banking revenue was offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses. Within Consumer Banking, the retail banking division's contribution decreased 88.2 percent on a linked quarter basis, as increases in the provision for credit losses and total noninterest expense were partially offset by higher total net revenue. Total net revenue for the retail banking division increased $37 million (2.8 percent) due principally to seasonally higher deposit service charges and lower retail lease residual losses. The favorable variance in total noninterest income was partially offset by a 1.5 percent decrease in net interest income, as the benefit of deposit growth was offset by lower loan volumes and the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Total noninterest expense for the retail banking division increased $23 million (2.9 percent) on a linked quarter basis. This increase was due primarily to higher FDIC deposit insurance expense and litigation-related costs, partially offset by the impact of cost containment activities. The provision for credit losses for the division increased by $132 million (33.2 percent), driven by an increase in net charge-offs and continued deterioration in the credit quality of consumer loans compared with the first quarter of 2009. The contribution of the mortgage banking division increased $37 million over the first quarter of 2009, driven by record mortgage production. Total net revenue increased by $86 million due to strong growth in mortgage banking revenue. Additionally, net interest income increased 8.6 percent primarily due to increased volumes in the mortgages held-for-sale portfolio. Total noninterest expense in the mortgage banking division increased by $19 million (18.8 percent) over the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the higher volume of activity.

percent decrease from the first quarter of 2009. Total net revenue year-over-year decreased $68 million (15.1 percent). Net interest income fell by $16 million (16.2 percent), primarily due to a decline in the margin benefit from average deposit balances, while total noninterest income decreased by $52 million (14.8 percent), reflecting the impact of unfavorable equity market conditions compared with a year ago. Total noninterest expense was 8.3 percent lower than the same quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower compensation and employee benefits expense and other intangibles expense, partially offset by higher FDIC deposit insurance expense.
     The decrease in the business line's contribution in the second quarter of 2009 compared with the prior quarter was the result of lower total net revenue (5.2 percent), partially offset by lower total noninterest expense (5.7 percent). Total net revenue was lower principally due to the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits. In addition, total noninterest income was lower by 1.3 percent as higher trust and investment management fees were offset by market-related valuation losses.
     includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing. Payment Services' offerings are highly inter-related with banking products and services of the other lines of business and rely on access to the bank subsidiary's settlement network, lower cost funding available to the Company, cross-selling opportunities and operating efficiencies. Payment Services contributed $62 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2009, a decrease of 74.8 percent from the same period of 2008 and 36.7 percent from the prior quarter. The decline year-over-year was due primarily to a $284 million increase in the provision for credit losses driven by an increase in net charge-offs and an increase in provision expense related to credit card portfolio growth, higher delinquency rates and changing economic conditions from a year ago. Total net revenue was relatively flat, as higher net interest income (16.6 percent) was offset by lower total noninterest income (5.1 percent). Net interest income increased $40 million due to strong growth in credit card balances, partially offset by the cost of rebates on the government card program, while total noninterest income decreased $39 million year-over-year, due to lower merchant processing services and corporate payment products revenues largely reflecting a decline in transaction volumes.
Payment Services
     Payment Services' contribution in the second quarter of 2009 decreased $36 million (36.7 percent) from the first quarter of 2009 due to an increase in the provision for credit losses (18.2 percent) and total noninterest expense (5.6 percent), partially offset by an increase in total net revenue.

Total noninterest income grew 5.1 percent due to seasonally higher transaction volumes and improved pricing. Total noninterest expense increased $21 million (5.6 percent) due principally to marketing expense for new credit card product initiatives.

Net interest income increased $67 million in the current quarter over the second quarter of 2008, reflecting the impact of the current rate environment, wholesale funding decisions and the Company's asset/liability position. Total noninterest income increased $34 million, primarily due to lower net securities losses. Total noninterest expense increased $167 million due principally to the FDIC special assessment and increased acquisition integration costs.
Treasury and Corporate Support
     Net income in the second quarter of 2009 was higher on a linked quarter basis as total net revenue increased $111 million, primarily due to the impact of changes in the interest rate environment and lower net securities losses, offset by the impact of the first quarter of 2009 gain from a corporate real estate transaction. Total noninterest expense was higher by $191 million, reflecting the FDIC special assessment and higher litigation and acquisition integration costs.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements often include the words "may," "could," "would," "should," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "targets," "potentially," "probably," "projects," "outlook" or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. A continuation of the recent turbulence in the global financial markets, particularly if it worsens, could impact our performance, both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities, and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally. Dramatic declines in the housing market in the past year have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. Concerns about the stability of the financial markets generally have reduced the availability of funding to certain financial institutions, leading to a tightening of credit, reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. There can be no assurance that any governmental program or legislation will help to stabilize the U.S. financial system or alleviate the industry or economic factors that may adversely impact our business. In addition, our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment, by increased regulation of financial institutions or other effects of recently enacted legislation, by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties, and by changes in the competitive landscape. Our results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of our loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in our investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, legal risk, and regulatory and compliance risk.
