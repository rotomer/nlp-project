Davis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, options to purchase 305,625 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $25.35 per share, the Companys closing stock price on October 22, 2009, the date of grant, and 98,619 performance restricted stock units ("Units"). Andrew Cecere, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, was granted options to purchase 183,374 shares of the Companys common stock, at an exercise price of $25.35 per share, and 59,172 Units. These awards replaced the long-term incentive awards made in January 2009 to Messrs. Davis and Cecere, that these officers declined to accept. The Compensation Committee also reinstated Mr. Daviss $1,255,500 cash incentive bonus and Mr. Ceceres $525,000 cash incentive bonus that these officers also declined when awarded in January 2009. The terms of the Units are generally similar to the Uni ts granted to the Companys other executive officers which were described on the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 6, 2009. The Units and options were awarded pursuant to the shareholder-approved U.S. Bancorp 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, a copy of which is on file with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 18, 2007.
