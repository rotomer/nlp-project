EXHIBIT 1.1
December 7, 2009
U.S. Bancorp USB Capital XIII 800 Nicollet Mall Minneapolis, MN 55402
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We (the "Representatives") understand that USB Capital XIII, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), and U.S. Bancorp, a Delaware corporation, as sponsor of the Trust and as guarantor (the "Guarantor"), propose that the Trust issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule I (the "Underwriters") 500,000 6.625% Trust Preferred Securities (liquidation amount $1,000 per Trust Preferred Security) with an aggregate liquidation amount of $500,000,000 (the "Offered Securities") representing preferred beneficial interests in the Trust. The Offered Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by U.S. Bancorp. The Guarantor will be the owner of all of the beneficial ownership interests represented by the common securities (aggregate liquidation amount $1,000,000) issued by the Trust (the "Common Securities"). Proceeds from the sale of the Offered Securities to the Underwriters and from the concurrent sale of the Common Securities to the Guarantor will be used to purchase 6.625% junior subordinated debentures due December 15, 2039 of the Guarantor (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures"). The Junior Subordinated Debentures will be issued by the Guarantor pursuant to a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of April 28, 2005, as amended and supplemented through the Closing Date (as defined below), (the "Indenture") between the Guarantor and Wilmington Trust Company, as successor trustee to Delaware Trust Company, National Association (the "Debenture Trustee").
     The Guarantor will, through the Indenture, the Junior Subordinated Debentures, the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, by and among U.S. Bancorp, as Sponsor, Wilmington Trust Company, as Property Trustee, Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee and the Administrative Trustees named therein, as amended and supplemented (the "Trust Agreement"), the Guarantee Agreement (the "Guarantee") between the Guarantor and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"), taken together, fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee on a subordinated basis all of the Trust's obligations under the Offered Securities.
     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and incorporated by reference herein, the Guarantor and the Trust hereby agree that the Guarantor shall sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the number of the Offered Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter at a purchase
 
price of $987.62 per Offered Security, plus accrued distributions, if any (the "Purchase Price"). The respective number of Offered Securities to be purchased by each of the Underwriters at the foregoing price shall be that proportion of Offered Securities which the number of Offered Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter as set forth on Schedule I bears to the aggregate number of Offered Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 10 Offered Securities).
     The Offered Securities shall have the terms that are further described in the Statutory Prospectus and the term sheet specified in Schedule II hereto.
     Except as otherwise provided herein, all the provisions contained in the document entitled "U.S. Bancorp Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (Capital Securities) (December 7, 2009)" (the "Standard Underwriting Agreement") are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety and shall be deemed to be a part of this Underwriting Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein.

     From time to time, U.S. Bancorp, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), and each of USB Capital XIII ("USB XIII"), USB Capital XIV ("USB XIV"), USB Capital XV ("USB XV") or USB Capital XVI ("USB XVI"), each a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, may enter into one or more underwriting agreements (each such agreement, an "Underwriting Agreement") that provide for the sale of designated capital securities to the several underwriters (the "Underwriters") named therein.
     The standard provisions hereof may be incorporated by reference in any Underwriting Agreement. As used herein, the term "Trust" means the statutory trust named in the first sentence of the Underwriting Agreement. The term "Agreement" means the Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions hereof incorporated therein by reference. Unless otherwise defined herein, all other defined terms have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Underwriting Agreement.
     The Guarantor and each of USB XIII, USB XIV, USB XV and USB XVI, severally and not jointly, issue from time to time, in one or more series, capital securities (the "Securities") pursuant to the provisions of the registration statement on Form S-3 filed on April 17, 2009 Registration No. 333-150298, as thereby amended. Such Securities may be issued in amounts, at prices and other terms to be determined in light of market conditions at the time of sale. The specific number of the Securities, title and liquidation preference of each Security, issuance price, distribution rate or rates (or method of calculation), distribution periods, distribution payment dates, redemption provisions, and any other specific terms of the Securities shall be set forth in a prospectus supplement. Promptly after execution and delivery of an Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantor and the Trust will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B under the Securities Act and paragraph (b) of Rule 424 under the Securities Act. Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B(f) is referred to as the "Rule 430B Information."
     The Securities specified in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement are the "Firm Securities." If specified in such Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantor and the Trust may grant to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of the Securities specified in such Underwriting Agreement as provided in Article III hereof (the "Optional Securities"). The Firm Securities and the Optional Securities, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Article III hereof are herein collectively called the "Offered Securities."
 
     The Guarantor and USB XIII, USB XIV, USB XV and USB XVI have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement in respect of the Securities, the Guarantee and the Junior Subordinated Debentures (collectively, the "Registered Securities"), including a prospectus relating to the Registered Securities, and will file with, the Commission a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Offered Securities pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement."
     The term "Basic Prospectus" means the base prospectus relating to the Registered Securities included in the Registration Statement in the form in which it has most recently been filed with the Commission and became effective on or prior to the date of the Underwriting Agreement.
     The term "Statutory Prospectus" means as of any time means the prospectus relating to the Offered Securities that is included in the Registration Statement immediately prior to the Applicable Time, including any document incorporated by reference therein and any preliminary or other prospectus deemed to be a part thereof.
     The term "Prospectus" means the final prospectus supplement dated the date of the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Offered Securities and the final base prospectus, collectively, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act at the time of the execution of the Underwriting Agreement.
     The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus (including the base prospectus and any preliminary prospectus supplement) used in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities that omits Rule 430B Information.
     As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement," "Basic Prospectus," "Prospectus" and "Preliminary Prospectus" shall include in each case the material, if any, incorporated by reference therein as of its effective time, in the case of the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, and as of the date of such prospectus, in the case of any Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus. Any reference to any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any document incorporated by reference after the date of such Basic Prospectus or any Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be. Any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to include any document incorporated by reference after the effective time of such Registration Statement.
     The term "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus" means any "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act ("Rule 433"), relating to the Offered Securities that
 
(i) is required to be filed with the Commission by the Guarantor or the Trust, (ii) is a "road show that is a written communication" within the meaning of Rule 433(d)(8)(i) whether or not required to be filed with the Commission or (iii) is exempt from filing pursuant to Rule 433(d)(5)(i) because it contains a description of the Offered Securities or of the offering that does not reflect the final terms, in each case in the form filed or required to be filed with the Commission or, if not required to be filed, in the form retained in the records of the Guarantor and the Trust pursuant to Rule 433(g).
     The term "Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is intended for general distribution to prospective investors, as evidenced by its being specified in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement.
     The term "Issuer Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus" means any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not an Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus.
     All references herein to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Date Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
     The "Guarantor Agreements" shall mean, collectively, the Guarantee, the Junior Subordinated Debentures, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture.
     The terms of the public offering of the Firm Securities are set forth in the General Disclosure Package (as such term is defined in Article VII(c) hereof) and the Prospectus.
     The Guarantor and the Trust may specify in the Underwriting Agreement applicable to any Securities that the Guarantor and the Trust thereby grant to the Underwriters the right (an "Overallotment Option") to purchase at their election up to the number of Optional Securities set forth in such Underwriting Agreement, on the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Securities may be exercised by written notice from each of the Representatives (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) to the Guarantor and the Trust, given within a period specified in the Underwriting Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the first Closing Date or, unless the Representatives, the Guarantor and the Trust otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Underwriting Agreement.
     The number of Optional Securities to be added to the number of Firm Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement applicable to such Securities shall be, in each case, the number of Optional Securities which the Guarantor has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter;
 
provided, that, if the Guarantor and the Trust have not been so advised, the number of Optional Securities to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Securities which the number of Firm Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate number of Firm Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 10 shares). The total number of Offered Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Underwriting Agreement plus the aggregate number of Optional Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
     Payment for the Securities shall be made in federal (same day) funds at the time, date and place set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, upon delivery to the Representatives, through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Securities. Each time and date of such payment and delivery of the Securities, including any payment and delivery pursuant to the exercise of the Overallotment Option by the Underwriters, is herein referred to as a "Closing Date." The Trust will cause the certificates representing the Securities to be made available for checking and packaging at least one day prior to the Closing Date at the office of DTC or its designated custodian.
     The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Guarantor and the Trust in or incorporated by reference in the Underwriting Agreement are, at and as of each Closing Date, true and correct, the condition that the Guarantor and the Trust shall have performed all of their respective obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and to the following additional conditions:

     (e) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of special tax counsel for the Trust and the Guarantor, to be specified in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Special Tax Counsel"), dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, to the effect set forth in Exhibit C.

     (k) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date a certificate of Wilmington Trust Company, as Debenture, Guarantee, Property and Delaware Trustee.
     (l) The Trust Agreement, the Guarantee and the Indenture shall have been duly authorized, executed and delivered, in each case in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives.
     (m) The Securities to be sold by the Trust at such time of delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange.
     In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters contained in the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantor and the Trust, jointly and severally, covenant as follows:
     (a) The Guarantor and the Trust will give the Representatives notice of their intention to file any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether by the filing of documents pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Securities Act or otherwise. The Guarantor and the Trust will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents, other than documents filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, proposed to be filed a reasonable time in advance of filing, and will furnish the Representatives with copies of documents filed pursuant to the Exchange Act promptly upon the filing thereof;
     (b) The Guarantor and the Trust will promptly notify the Representatives immediately (i) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) of the mailing or the delivery to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (iv) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation or threat of initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, or (vi) of the suspension of qualification of the Offered Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threat of initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. The Guarantor and the Trust will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order or suspension of qualification and, if any stop order or suspension of qualification is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment;
     (c) If, during the period after the date of the first public offering of the Offered Securities when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, a notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of the counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Guarantor and the Trust, to further amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of either such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or to file a new registration statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations issued by the Commission thereunder, immediate notice shall be given, and confirmed in writing, to the Representatives, and the Guarantor and the Trust will promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or otherwise, or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, and the Guarantor and the Trust each will use its best efforts to have any such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Offered Securities); and if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or any other registration statement relating to the Offered Securities or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Guarantor will
 
promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission;
     (d) The Guarantor and the Trust will make generally available to its security holders (as defined in Rule 158) as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the close of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year and 90 days after the close of each fiscal year, earnings statements (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158) with respect to each sale of Securities;
     (e) The Guarantor and the Trust will deliver to the Representatives, without charge, as many signed and conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) as the Representatives may reasonably request; and the copies of the Original Registration Statement and each amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. The Guarantor and the Trust will furnish to the Representatives as many copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as the Representatives shall reasonably request so long as the Underwriters are required to deliver a Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, a notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) in connection with the offering or sale of the Offered Securities; and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T;
     (f) The Guarantor and the Trust will endeavor, in cooperation with the Representatives, to qualify the Offered Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Representatives may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Offered Securities; provided, however, that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Guarantor and the Trust will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been qualified as above provided;

     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information (or any amendment to the Registration Statement), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
 
supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement);
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Representatives as aforesaid) if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Guarantor or the Trust (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Indemnified Person), as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Representatives as aforesaid), to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above.
     (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Guarantor and the Trust, each of their respective directors or trustees, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement).
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances; provided, however, that when more than one of the Underwriters is an indemnified party each such Underwriter shall be entitled to separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in each such jurisdiction to the extent such Underwriter may have interests conflicting with those of the other
 
Underwriter or Underwriters because of the participation of one Underwriter in a transaction hereunder in which the other Underwriter or Underwriters did not participate. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Section VIII is for any reason held to be unavailable to the Underwriters in accordance with its terms, the Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to Securities sold to the Underwriters in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in such proportion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by the Underwriters to the date of such liability bears to the total sales price (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust from the sale of the Offered Securities made to the Underwriters to the date of such liability, and the Guarantor and the Trust are responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the Underwriters failed to give the notice required under (c), then the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor and the Trust or the Representatives and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were determined pro rata (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph that were offered and sold to the public through the Underwriters exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled under this paragraph to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as
 
such Underwriter, and each director of the Guarantor, each trustee of the Trust, each officer of the Guarantor and the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Guarantor and the Trust.
     The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section VIII hereof and the representations and warranties of the Guarantor and the Trust in this Agreement or in any certificate submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Guarantor and the Trust or each of their respective directors or trustees or each of their officers or any person controlling the Guarantor and the Trust and (iii) acceptance of any payment for any of the Offered Securities, if any.
     If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Offered Securities, which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Offered Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Offered Securities then the Guarantor and the Trust shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Offered Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Guarantor and the Trust that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities or the Guarantor or the Trust notify the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities, the Representatives, the Guarantor or the Trust shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor and the Trust agree to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriters" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section X with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Offered Securities.
     If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Guarantor and the Trust as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Offered Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Offered Securities then the Guarantor and the Trust shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the Offered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Offered
 
Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Offered Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Guarantor and the Trust as provided in the first paragraph of this Section X, the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Offered Securities or if the Guarantor and the Trust shall not exercise the right described in the immediately preceding paragraph to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriters, the Guarantor or the Trust, except for the expenses to be borne by the Guarantor, the Trust and the Underwriters as provided in Section XI hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section VIII hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     The Guarantor covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Guarantor will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Guarantor's and the Trust's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and to dealers and any costs associated with electronic delivery of any of the foregoing by the Underwriters to investors; (ii) the cost of printing this Agreement and any Blue Sky and legal investment memoranda; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Offered Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section VI hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with such qualification and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky memorandum or any Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture, the Trust Agreement and the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses incident to any Overallotment Options which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this section; (viii) the costs and expenses (including without limitation any damages or other amounts payable in connection with legal or contractual liability) associated with the reforming of any contracts for sale of the Offered Securities made by the Underwriters caused by a breach of the representation contained in the fourth paragraph of Article VII(c); and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section XI. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section XI and Sections VIII and XII hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Offered Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
 
     If the Underwriting Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Guarantor or the Trust to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, or if for any reason the Guarantor or the Trust shall be unable to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement except pursuant to Article X hereof, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated the Underwriting Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
     In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Offered Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose hereunder.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the principal offices of the Representatives and if to the Guarantor or the Trust shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the Guarantor set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, Attention: Treasurer; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section VIII hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Underwriters' Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Guarantor by the Representatives upon request.
     This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Guarantor, the Trust and, to the extent provided in Section VIII hereof, the officers and directors of the Guarantor, the Trust and each person who controls the Guarantor or the Trust or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Offered Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     The Trust and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Offered Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such
 
transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Trust or the Guarantor, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Trust or the Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Trust or the Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Trust or the Guarantor except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Trust and the Guarantor, and (v) the Trust and the Guarantor have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate. The Trust and the Guarantor agree that they will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Trust or the Guarantor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto, or the financial, tax or other related consequences of the transaction for the Trust or the Guarantor.
     Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
     This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
     This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties created hereby shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

     (vi) The Junior Subordinated Debentures have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and, when authenticated by the Debenture Trustee, executed, issued and delivered in the manner provided in the Indenture, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with their terms, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect, and (B) general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

     (ix) The Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information, the Prospectus, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of their respective effective or issue dates (including without limitation each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act), other than the financial statements, supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, and any Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (each a "Form T-1"), as to which such counsel need express no opinion complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

     (xii) No consent, approval, license, authorization, or order of any federal or Delaware court or federal or Delaware government authority or agency is required for the performance by the Trust and the Guarantor of their obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (xiv) The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Guarantee, the Indenture, the issuance of the Guarantee and the Junior Subordinated Debentures, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein, and the performance of the obligations hereunder and thereunder will not result in a violation of any federal or state law nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Guarantor.
     (xv) The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement by the Trust and the performance by the Trust of its obligations hereunder, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the Common Securities by the Trust and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby will not violate any provision of federal law or, to the best knowledge of such counsel, any agreement or instrument binding upon the Trust or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Trust, except such contravention as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or other), business, properties, net worth or results of operations of the Trust.
     Such counsel shall also have furnished to the Representatives a written statement, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that (x) such counsel has acted as counsel to the Guarantor in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein, and in the course of preparation of those documents such counsel has participated in conferences with representatives of the Guarantor and with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP and (y) based upon such counsel's examination of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein, such counsel's investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein and such counsel's participation in the conferences referred to above, such counsel has no reason to believe that: (A) the Registration Statement including the Rule 430B Information (other than the financial statements, supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, and any Form T-1, as to which no statement need be rendered), as of its effective date and each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f) under the Securities Act, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (B) that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than the financial statements, supporting schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which no statement need be rendered) as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
 
they were made, not misleading.

With respect to statements contained in the General Disclosure Package, any statement contained in any of the constituent documents shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that any information contained in subsequent constituent documents modifies or replaces such statement.

     (i) The Guarantor is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each U.S. jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of substantial properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure so to qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
     (ii) U.S. Bank National Association is lawfully able to transact business in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases substantial properties or conducts business, except for the jurisdictions in which the failure to be lawfully able to conduct business would not have a material adverse effect on U.S. Bank National Association and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

In addition, the opinion or opinions of the Special Tax Counsel, to be delivered pursuant to Section V(e) of the Agreement, shall confirm the opinions set forth in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences."

The Company is authorized to direct payments to U.S. Bank National Association, in its capacity as paying agent under the Trust Agreement (as defined below), or any other paying agent appointed under the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from December 10, 2009 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2009, at the rate of 6.625% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum, compounded semi-annually. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month period and, for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.

A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Property Trustee or the principal offices of the Property Trustee under the Trust Agreement hereinafter referred to for USB CAPITAL XIII, is closed for business.

to Holders of the Securities of this series not fewer than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more full provided in said Indenture.

Trust Enforcement Events; Waiver
          (a) The Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, by vote or written consent, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Capital Securities, waive any past Trust Enforcement Event in respect of the Capital Securities and its consequences, provided that, if the underlying Indenture Event of Default:
     (i) is not waivable under the Indenture, the Trust Enforcement Event under the Trust Agreement shall also not be waivable; or
     (ii) requires the consent or vote of the Holders of greater than a majority in principal amount of the Debentures (a "Super Majority") to be waived under the Indenture, the related Trust Enforcement Event under the Trust Agreement may only be waived by the vote or written consent of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities that the
 
relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding.
          The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(a) shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act and such Section 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act is hereby expressly excluded from this Trust Agreement and the Securities, as permitted by the Trust Indenture Act. Upon such waiver, any such default shall cease to exist, and any Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Capital Securities arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Trust Agreement and the Capital Securities, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Capital Securities or impair any right consequent thereon. Any waiver by the Holders of the Capital Securities of a Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Capital Securities shall also be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Holders of the Common Securities of any such Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Common Securities for all purposes of this Trust Agreement without any further act, vote, or consent of the Holders of the Common Securities.
          (b) The Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities may, by vote or written consent, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Common Securities, waive any past Trust Enforcement Event in respect of the Common Securities and its consequences, provided that, if the underlying Indenture Event of Default:
     (i) is not waivable under the Indenture, except where the Holders of the Common Securities are deemed to have waived such Trust Enforcement Event under the Trust Agreement as provided below in this Section 2.6(b), the Trust Enforcement Event under the Trust Agreement shall also not be waivable; or
     (ii) requires the consent or vote of a Super Majority to be waived under the Indenture, except where the Holders of the Common Securities are deemed to have waived such Trust Enforcement Event under the Trust Agreement as provided below in this Section 2.6(b), the Trust Enforcement Event under the Trust Agreement may only be waived by the vote or written consent of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities that the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding;
provided further, each Holder of Common Securities will be deemed to have waived any Trust Enforcement Event and all Trust Enforcement Events with respect to the Common Securities and the consequences thereof until all Trust Enforcement Events with respect to the Capital Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, and until such Trust Enforcement Events with respect to the Capital Securities have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee will be deemed to be acting solely on behalf of the Holders of the Capital Securities and only the Holders of the Capital Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Securities. The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(b) shall be in lieu of Sections 316(a)(1)(A) and 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act and such Sections 316(a)(1)(A) and 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act are hereby expressly excluded from this Trust Agreement and the Securities, as permitted by the Trust Indenture Act. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(b), upon such cure, waiver or other
 
elimination, any such default shall cease to exist and any Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Common Securities arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Trust Agreement, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Common Securities or impair any right consequent thereon.
          (c) A waiver of an Indenture Event of Default by the Property Trustee at the direction of the Holders of the Capital Securities constitutes a waiver of the corresponding Trust Enforcement Event with respect to the Capital Securities under this Trust Agreement. The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(c) shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act and such Section 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act is hereby expressly excluded from this Trust Agreement and the Securities, as permitted by the Trust Indenture Act.

     (i) a default under Sections 5.1(1) and 5.1(2) of the Indenture; or

The right, title and interest of the Property Trustee to the Debentures shall vest automatically in each Person who may hereafter be appointed as Property Trustee in accordance with Section 6.6.

          (b) The Property Trustee shall not transfer its right, title and interest in the Debentures to the Administrative Trustees or to the Delaware Trustee (if the Property Trustee does not also act as Delaware Trustee).
          (c) The Property Trustee shall:
     (i) cause the Paying Agent to establish and maintain a segregated non-interest bearing trust account (the "Property Account") in the name of and under the exclusive control of the Paying Agent or the Property Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the Securities and, upon the receipt of payments of funds made in respect of the Debentures held by the Property Trustee, deposit such funds into the Property Account and make payments to the Holders of the Capital Securities and Holders of the Common Securities from the Property Account in accordance with Section 7.2.

     (ii) engage in such ministerial activities as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect the redemption of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities to the extent the Debentures are redeemed or mature; and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Trust Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debenture Issuer to pay interest in full on the Debentures for a period of 30 days after a Deferral Period has continued for more than 10 consecutive semi-annual periods, then a Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a proceeding against the Debenture Issuer for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal of or interest on Debentures having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Trust Agreement or the Indenture, the Debenture Issuer shall have the right to set-off any payment it is otherwise required to make under the Indenture in respect of any Capital Security to the extent the Debenture Issuer has heretofore made, or is currently on the date of such payment making, a payment under the Guarantee relating to such Capital Security or under Section 5.8 of the Indenture.
          (f) The Property Trustee shall continue to serve as a Trustee until either:
     (i) the Trust has been completely liquidated and the proceeds of the liquidation distributed to the Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of the Securities; or
     (ii) a Successor Property Trustee has been appointed and has accepted that appointment in accordance with Section 6.6.
          (g) The Property Trustee shall have the legal power to exercise all of the rights, powers and privileges of a holder of Debentures under the Indenture and, if a Trust Enforcement Event actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee occurs and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall, for the benefit of Holders of the Securities, enforce its rights as holder of the Debentures subject to the rights of the Holders pursuant to the terms of such Securities.
          (h) [Reserved]

Certain Duties and Responsibilities of the Property Trustee
          (a) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Trust Enforcement Event and after the curing of all Trust Enforcement Events that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Property Trustee. In case a Trust Enforcement Event has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 2.6) of which a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee has actual knowledge, the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
          (b) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

     (iii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it without negligence, in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement;
     (iv) no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Property Trustee against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it;
     (v) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe-keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Property Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act;
     (vi) the Property Trustee shall have no duty or liability for or with respect to the value, genuineness, existence or sufficiency of the Debentures or the payment of any taxes or assessments levied thereon or in connection therewith;

     (viii) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for any default or misconduct of the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor.

Exchanges.

Such election (i) shall be exercisable by such Sponsor Affiliated Holder delivering to the Property Trustee and the Security Registrar a written notice of such election specifying the liquidation amount of the Capital Securities with respect to which such election is being made and the date on which such exchange shall occur, which date shall be not less than ten Business Days after the date of receipt by the Property Trustee and the Security Registrar of such election notice and which may be any date other than a record date for any Distribution or a date from such record date to and including the Distribution Date for such Distribution and (ii) shall be conditioned upon such Sponsor Affiliated Holder having delivered or caused to be delivered to the Property Trustee or its designee via the Security Registrar the Capital Securities which are the subject of such election by 10:00 A.M.

     (i) Capital Securities. The Capital Securities of the Trust have an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of up to Five Hundred Million dollars ($500,000,000) with respect to the closing of the sale of Capital Securities on one or more occasions. The Capital Securities are hereby designated for identification purposes only as "6.625% Trust Preferred Securities" (the "Capital Securities"). The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A to this Trust Agreement, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed or quoted.
     (ii) Common Securities. The Common Securities of the Trust have an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of up to one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the closing of the sale of Common Securities on one or more occasions. The Common Securities are hereby designated for identification purposes only as "6.625% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities" and, together with the Capital Securities, the "Securities"). The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B to this Trust Agreement, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
          (b) Payment of Distributions on, and payment of the Redemption Price upon a redemption of, the Capital Securities and the Common Securities, as applicable, shall be made Pro Rata based on the liquidation amount of such Capital Securities and Common Securities; , that if on any date on which amounts payable on distribution or redemption, an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution on, or Redemption Price of, any of the Common Securities, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of such Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions on all of the outstanding Capital Securities for all Distribution periods terminating on or prior thereto, or, in
provided, however
 
the case of amounts payable on redemption, the full amount of the Redemption Price for all of the outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions on, or the Redemption Price of, the Capital Securities then due and payable. The Trust shall issue no securities or other interests in the assets of the Trust other than the Capital Securities and the Common Securities.
          (c) The Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Trust by an Administrative Trustee. Such signature shall be the manual or facsimile signature of any present or any future Administrative Trustee. In case an Administrative Trustee of the Trust who shall have signed any of the Certificates shall cease to be such Administrative Trustee before the Certificates so signed shall be delivered by the Trust, such Certificates nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such Certificates had not ceased to be such Administrative Trustee; and any Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Trust by such persons who, at the actual date of execution of such Certificate, shall be the Administrative Trustees of the Trust, although at the date of the execution and delivery of the Trust Agreement any such person was not such an Administrative Trustee. Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Administrative Trustees may deem appropriate, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage.
     A Certificate representing Capital Securities shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Property Trustee. Such signature shall be conclusive evidence that such Certificate has been authenticated under this Trust Agreement.
     Upon a written order of the Trust signed by one Administrative Trustee, the Property Trustee shall authenticate the Certificates representing Capital Securities for original issue. The aggregate amount of Capital Securities outstanding at any time shall not exceed the liquidation amount set forth in Section 7.1(a)(i).
     The Property Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Trust to authenticate Certificates. An authenticating agent may authenticate Certificates whenever the Property Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Trust Agreement to authentication by the Property Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as the Property Trustee to deal with the Sponsor or an Affiliate of the Sponsor.
          (d) The consideration received by the Trust for the issuance of the Securities shall constitute a contribution to the capital of the Trust and shall not constitute a loan to the Trust.
          (e) Upon issuance of the Securities as provided in this Trust Agreement, the Securities so issued shall be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust.
 
          (f) Every Person, by virtue of having become a Holder or a Capital Security Beneficial Owner in accordance with the terms of this Trust Agreement, shall be deemed to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms of, and shall be bound by, this Trust Agreement and the terms of the Securities.
          (g) The holders of the Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights.

          (a) As owners of undivided beneficial ownership interests in the Debentures, holders of Securities shall be entitled (subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.2(a)) to receive cumulative cash Distributions at the rate per annum of 6.625% of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per Security. Pursuant to the Indenture, the amount of interest on the Debentures payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual interest period, and, as a result, Distributions on the Securities payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual distribution period shall be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and for periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. Subject to Section 7.1(b), Distributions shall be made on the Capital Securities and the Common Securities on a Pro Rata basis. Pursuant to the Indenture, interest on the Debentures shall, from the date of original issue, accrue and be cumulative, and, as a result Distributions on the Securities shall, from the date of original issue, accumulate and be cumulative. Distributions shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2010, when, as and if available for payment, by the Property Trustee, except as otherwise described below. Distributions are payable only to the extent that payments are made by the Debenture Issuer in respect of the Debentures held by the Property Trustee and to the extent that the Trust has funds available for the payment of such Distributions in the Property Account.
          (b) Pursuant to the Indenture, interest not paid on the scheduled payment date will accrue and compound semi-annually at the rate of 6.625% per annum, and, as a result, interest on the Debentures not paid on the scheduled payment date will accrue and compound semi-annually at the rate of 6.625% per annum (and, as a result) the Distributions on the Securities will accumulate and compound at the rate of 6.625% per annum ("Compounded Distributions"). "Distributions" shall mean ordinary cumulative distributions together with any Compounded Distributions.
          (c) If and to the extent that the Debenture Issuer makes a payment of interest, premium and/or principal on the Debentures held by the Property Trustee (the amount of any such payment being a "Payment Amount"), the Property Trustee shall and is directed, to the extent funds are available for that purpose, make a Pro Rata distribution of the Payment Amount to Holders, subject to Section 7.1(b).
          (d) Distributions on the Securities shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the register of the Trust as of the close of business on the relevant record dates. While the Capital Securities are represented by one or more Global Securities, the relevant record dates shall be the close of business the Business Day preceding such Distribution payment date; otherwise the relevant record date shall be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) preceding such Distribution payment date. At all times, the Distribution payment dates
 
shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Debenture Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Debentures, shall cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with this Trust Agreement. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such payment date.
          (e) In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata among the Holders of the Securities except as provided in Section 7.1(b).
     SECTION 7.3. .
Redemption of Securities
          (a) Upon the repayment or redemption, in whole or in part, of the Debentures held by the Trust, whether at the stated maturity of the Debentures or upon earlier redemption as provided in the Indenture, the proceeds from such repayment or redemption shall be simultaneously applied Pro Rata (subject to Section 7.1(b)) to redeem Securities having an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so repaid or redeemed at the Redemption Price. Holders shall be given not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days notice of such redemption in accordance with Section 7.4.
          (b) On the date fixed for any distribution of Debentures, upon dissolution of the Trust, (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and (ii) certificates representing Securities will be deemed to represent the Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the stated liquidation amount of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest equal to accumulated and unpaid distributions on, such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Sponsor or its agent for transfer or reissuance.
     SECTION 7.4. .
Redemption Procedures
          (a) Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Debentures in exchange for, the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice"), which notice shall be irrevocable, will be given by the Trust by mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Debentures. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 7.4(a), a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to Holders of Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the register of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect
 
to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
          (b) If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Common Securities and the Capital Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata (subject to Section 7.1(b)) and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be redeemed as described in Section 7.4(c) below. The particular Capital Securities to be redeemed will be selected on a Pro Rata basis by the Property Trustee from the outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption, by such method (including, without limitation, by lot) as the Property Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. The Trust may not redeem the Securities in part unless all accumulated and unpaid Distributions to the date of redemption have been paid in full on all Securities then outstanding. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate liquidation amount of Capital Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
          (c) Subject to the Trust's fulfillment of the notice requirements set forth in Section 7.4(a) above, if Securities are to be redeemed, then (i) with respect to Capital Securities represented by one or more Global Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided that the Debenture Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Property Trustee will deposit irrevocably with the Depositary or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give the Depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities and (ii) with respect to Securities not represented by one or more Global Securities, provided that the Debenture Issuer has paid the Property Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Property Trustee will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities upon surrender of their certificates evidencing the Capital Securities. Payment of the Redemption Price on the Capital Securities will be made to the recordholders thereof as they appear on the register of the Trust on the relevant record date, which shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant redemption date; that with respect to the Capital Securities not represented by one or more Global Securities, the relevant record date shall be the date fifteen days prior to the relevant redemption date. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If, however, the Business Day falls in the next calendar year, then payment of the Redemption Price will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is not paid because the payment of the Redemption Price on the Debentures is not made, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and, as a result, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accumulate at the then applicable rate from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price. For these purposes, the applicable Redemption Price shall not include
provided, however,
 
Distributions which are being paid to Holders who were Holders on a relevant record date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited or paid as required, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit or payment, Distributions will cease to accumulate on the Securities called for redemption and all rights of Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price, and from and after the date fixed for redemption, such Securities will cease to be outstanding.
     Neither the Administrative Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been called for redemption, except in the case of any Securities being redeemed in part, any portion thereof not to be redeemed.
          (d) Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Debenture Issuer or its subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Capital Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.
     SECTION 7.5. .
Voting Rights of Capital Securities
          (a) Except as provided under Section 6.6, Section 11.1 and this Article 7 and as otherwise required by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the Trust Indenture Act and other applicable law, the Holders of the Capital Securities shall have no voting rights.
          (b) Subject to the requirement of the Property Trustee obtaining a tax opinion in certain circumstances set forth in Section 7.5(d) below, the Holders of a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities voting separately as a class have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under the Trust Agreement, including the right to direct the Property Trustee, as Holder of the Debentures, to (i) exercise the remedies available to it under the Indenture as a Holder of the Debentures; (ii) consent to any amendment or modification of the Indenture or the Debentures where such consent shall be required or (iii) waive any past default and its consequences that is waivable under Section 5.13 of the Indenture; , that if an Indenture Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(1), (2) and (3) of the Indenture has occurred and is continuing, then the Holders of 25% of the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities may direct the Property Trustee to declare the principal of and interest on the Debentures due and payable; provided, further, that where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of more than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Debentures affected thereby, only the Holders of the percentage of the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Capital Securities which is at least equal to the percentage required under the Indenture may direct the Property Trustee to give such consent to take such action.
provided, however
          (c) If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures after a Holder of Capital Securities has made a written request, such Holder of Capital Securities may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, institute a legal proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Indenture without first
 
instituting any legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other Person. In addition, if a Trust Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debenture Issuer to pay interest in full on the Debentures for a period of 30 days after a Deferral Period has continued for more than 10 consecutive semi-annual periods, then a Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a Direct Action against the Debenture Issuer on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures;

Such notice shall state that such Indenture Event of Default also constitutes a Trust Enforcement Event. Except with respect to directing the time, method, and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy, the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to take any of the actions described in clause 7.5(b)(i) and (ii) above unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such action.
          (e) In the event the consent of the Property Trustee, as the Holder of the Debentures, is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment or modification of the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall request the direction of the Holders of the Capital Securities with respect to such amendment or modification and shall vote with respect to such amendment or modification as directed by not less than a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities voting together as a single class; , that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of the Holders of more than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures, the Property Trustee may only give such consent at the direction of the Holders of at least the same proportion in aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Securities. The Property Trustee shall not take any such action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Securities unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such action.
provided, however
          (f) A waiver of an Indenture Event of Default with respect to the Debentures will constitute a waiver of the corresponding Trust Enforcement Event.
          (g) Any required approval or direction of Holders of Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities or pursuant to written consent. The Administrative Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote to be mailed to each Holder of record of Capital Securities.

          (h) No vote or consent of the Holders of Capital Securities shall be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Capital Securities or distribute Debentures in accordance with this Trust Agreement and the terms of the Securities.
 
          (i) Notwithstanding that Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Securities that are owned at such time by the Debenture Issuer, any Administrative Trustee or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Debenture Issuer or any Administrative Trustee, shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if such Securities were not outstanding; , that Persons otherwise eligible to vote to whom the Debenture Issuer or any of its subsidiaries have pledged Capital Securities may vote or consent with respect to such pledged Capital Securities under any of the circumstances described herein.
provided, however
          (j) Subject to Sections 6.6(a) and 7.5(k), Holders of the Capital Securities shall have no rights to appoint or remove the Trustees, who may be appointed, removed or replaced solely by the Common Securities Holder.
          (k) If an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may be removed at such time only by a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities.
          (l) The Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of the Securities.
     SECTION 7.6. .
Voting Rights of Common Securities
          (a) Except as provided under Section 6.1(b), this Section 7.6 or Section 11.1 or as otherwise required by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the Trust Indenture Act or other applicable law or provided by the Trust Agreement, the Holders of the Common Securities will have no voting rights.

provided, however
 
which is at least equal to the percentage required under the Indenture may direct the Property Trustee to have such consent or take such action. Except with respect to directing the time, method, and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy, the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to take any of the actions described in clause 7.6(c)(i) and (ii) above unless the Property Trustee has obtained an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect that, as a result of such action, for United States federal income tax purposes the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust.
          (d) If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures after a Holder of Common Securities has made a written request, such Holder of Common Securities may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, directly institute a legal proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Debentures without first instituting any legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other Person.

If:
     (a) any mutilated Certificates should be surrendered to the Administrative Trustees, or if the Administrative Trustees shall receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate; and
     (b) there shall be delivered to the Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to keep each of the Trustees, the Sponsor and the Trust harmless,
 
then, in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, any Administrative Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 7.10, the Administrative Trustees may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.
     SECTION 7.11. .
Deemed Security Holders
     The Trustees may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered on the register of the Trust as the sole holder of such Certificate and of the Securities represented by such Certificate for purposes of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such Certificate or in the Securities represented by such Certificate on the part of any Person, whether or not the Trust shall have actual or other notice thereof.
     SECTION 7.12. .
Global Securities
     On initial issuance, the Capital Securities shall be issued in definitive form to the Sponsor. Upon transfer by the Sponsor of the Capital Securities, the Capital Securities may be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities. If the Capital Securities are to be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities, then an Administrative Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and the Property Trustee shall authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of all of the Capital Securities to be issued in the form of Global Securities and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or the nominee of such Depositary, and (iii) shall be delivered by the Property Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions. Global Securities shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect:
"This Capital Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Trust Agreement hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (the "Depositary"), or a nominee of the Depositary. This Capital Security is exchangeable for Capital Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Trust Agreement and no transfer of this Capital Security (other than a transfer of this Capital Security as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary) may be registered except in limited circumstances.
Unless this Capital Security Certificate is presented by an authorized representative of the Depositary to USB Capital XIII or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Capital Security Certificate issued is
 
registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary (and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein."
     Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security issued in exchange for all or a part of a Global Security pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Property Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Property Trustee shall deliver such Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security to the Persons in whose names such definitive Capital Securities are so registered.
     At such time as all interests in Global Securities have been redeemed, repurchased or cancelled, such Global Securities shall be, upon receipt thereof, cancelled by the Property Trustee in accordance with standing procedures of the Depositary. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in Global Securities is exchanged for Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security, redeemed, cancelled or transferred to a transferee who receives Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security therefor or any Capital Security not represented by a Global Security is exchanged or transferred for part of Global Securities, the principal amount of such Global Securities shall, in accordance with the standing procedures of the Depositary, be reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Securities by the Property Trustee to reflect such reduction or increase.
     The Trust and the Property Trustee may for all purposes, including the making of payments due on the Capital Securities, deal with the Depositary as the authorized representative of the Holders for the purposes of exercising the rights of Holders hereunder. The rights of the owner of any beneficial interest in a Global Security shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such owners and depository participants provided that no such agreement shall give any rights to any Person against the Trust or the Property Trustee without the written consent of the parties so affected. Multiple requests and directions from and votes of the Depositary as holder of Capital Securities in global form with respect to any particular matter shall not be deemed inconsistent to the extent they do not represent an amount of Capital Securities in excess of those held in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
     If at any time the Depositary for any Capital Securities represented by one or more Global Securities notifies the Trust that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Capital Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Capital Securities shall no longer be eligible under this Section 7.12, the Trust shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Capital Securities. If a successor Depositary for such Capital Securities is not appointed by the Trust within 90 days after the Trust receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Trust's election that such Capital Securities be represented by one or more Global Securities shall no longer be effective and the Trust shall execute, and the Property Trustee will authenticate and deliver, Capital Securities in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the principal amount of
 
the Global Security or Capital Securities representing such Capital Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Capital Securities.
     The Trust may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Capital Securities issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security or Capital Securities. In such event the Trust shall execute, and the Property Trustee, shall authenticate and deliver, Capital Securities in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Capital Securities representing such Capital Securities, in exchange for such Global Security or Capital Securities.
     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement (other than the provisions set forth in Section 7.9), Global Securities may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred or exchanged for Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security and Capital Securities not represented by a Global Security may be transferred or exchange for Global Securities in accordance with rules of the Depositary and the provisions of Section 7.9.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
          (b) The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
          (c) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Debenture Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Administrative Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
          (d) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4 shall be paid by the Debenture Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
 
undertaking by or on behalf of such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Debenture Issuer as authorized in this Section 9.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Debenture Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (1) by the Administrative Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Administrative Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (3) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Administrative Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Administrative Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Capital Security Holders.
          (e) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 9.4 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Debenture Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 9.4 shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Debenture Issuer and each Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 9.4 is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 9.4 shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
          (f) The Debenture Issuer or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Debenture Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 9.4.
          (g) For purposes of this Section 9.4, references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 9.4 with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
          (h) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 9.4 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Debenture Issuer Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The obligation to
 
indemnify as set forth in this Section 9.4 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee or the termination of this Trust Agreement.

          (c) The Guarantee Trustee appointed to office shall hold such office until a Successor Guarantee Trustee shall have been appointed or until its removal or resignation.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Guarantor retains all of its rights under the Indenture to defer the interest payments on the Debentures pursuant to the terms thereof and the Guarantor shall not be obligated hereunder to make any Guarantee Payments during any Extension Period (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Distributions (as defined in the Trust Agreement) on the Securities.

     SECTION 5.3.

     (a) The release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by the Trust of any express or implied agreement, covenant, term or condition relating to the Securities to be performed or observed by the Trust;
     (b) The extension of time for the payment by the Trust of all or any portion of the Distributions, Redemption Price, Liquidation Distribution or any other sums payable under the terms of the Securities or the extension of time for the performance of any other obligation under, arising out of, or in connection with the Securities (other than an extension of time for payment of Distributions, Redemption Price, Liquidation Distribution or other sum payable that results from the extension of any interest payment period on the Debentures);
     (c) Any failure, omission, delay or lack of diligence on the part of the Property Trustee or the Holders to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on the Property Trustee or the Holders pursuant to the terms of the

          (b) If the Guarantee Trustee fails to enforce this Guarantee, then any Holder of Securities may, subject to the subordination provisions of Section 6.2, institute a legal proceeding directly against the Guarantor to enforce the Guarantee Trustee's rights under this Guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Trust, the Guarantee Trustee or any other person or entity. In addition, if the Guarantor has failed to make a Guarantee Payment, a Holder of Securities may, subject to the subordination provisions of Section 6.2, directly institute a proceeding against the Guarantor for enforcement of the Guarantee for such payment to the Holder of the Securities of the principal of or interest on the Debentures on or after the respective due dates specified in the Debentures, and the amount of the payment will be based on the Holder's pro rata share of the amount due and owing on all of the Securities. The Guarantor hereby waives any right or remedy to require that any action on this Guarantee be brought first against the Trust or any other person or entity before proceeding directly against the Guarantor.
     SECTION 5.5.

          This Guarantee creates a guarantee of payment and not of collection.
     SECTION 5.6.

If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence, the Guarantor agrees to hold such amount in trust for the Holders and to pay over such amount to the Guarantee Trustee for the benefit of the Holders.
     SECTION 5.7.
Independent Obligations.
          The Guarantor acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of the Trust with respect to the Securities, and that the Guarantor shall be liable as principal and as debtor hereunder to make Guarantee Payments pursuant to the terms of this Guarantee notwithstanding the occurrence of any event referred to in subsections 5.3(a) through 5.3(g), inclusive, hereof.

of stock under any such plan or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights pursuant thereto, (c) payments under this Guarantee and (d) purchases of Common Stock related to the issuance of Common Stock or rights under any of the Company's benefits plans for its directors, officers or employees).
     SECTION 6.2.

U.S. Bancorp 800 Nicollet Mall Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special tax counsel to U.S. Bancorp, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor") and USB Capital XIII (the "Trust"), a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware, in connection with the preparation and filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement"), dated May 2, 2005, as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement (and accompanying base prospectus) dated December 7, 2009 (the "Preliminary Prospectus"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to (A) up to $500,000,000 6.625% Trust Preferred Securities (the "Capital Securities"), to be issued from time to time by the Trust, (B) up to $501,000,000 principal amount of junior subordinated debentures, and (C) a guarantee of payment on the Capital Securities to be issued by the Company.
     We have examined such documents and have reviewed such questions of law, as we have considered necessary and appropriate for the purposes of our opinion set forth below. In rendering our opinions set forth below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Guarantor and the Trust, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties. As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon factual statements and factual representations of officers, trustees and other representatives of the Guarantor and the Trust, and others.
     Based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
     The statements made in the Prospectus Supplement, under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," to the extent such statements summarize material

All such statements are based upon current law, which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Further, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court will not take a contrary position.
     Our opinions expressed above are limited to the federal tax laws of the United States of America.
     We hereby consent to your filing this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" contained in the Prospectus Supplement included therein.
