Exhibit 99.1
          U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $766 million for the second quarter of 2010, or $.45 per diluted common share. Earnings per diluted common share included a $.05 benefit related to a non-recurring exchange of perpetual preferred stock for outstanding income trust securities during the quarter. Earnings for the second quarter were driven by record total net revenue of $4.5 billion, the result of strong year-over-year growth in both net interest income and fee revenue. Highlights for the second quarter of 2010 included:

     Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $766 million for the second quarter of 2010, 62.6 percent higher than the $471 million for the second quarter of 2009 and 14.5 percent higher than the $669 million for the first quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per common share of $.45 in the second quarter of 2010 were $.33 higher than the second quarter of 2009 and $.11 higher than the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.09 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2010, compared with .71 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter of 2010 included $.05 related to the issuance of perpetual preferred stock in exchange for certain income trust securities, net of related debt extinguishment costs. Additional significant items in the second quarter of 2010 included provision for credit losses in excess of net-charge-offs of $25 million, net securities losses of $21 million and a $28 million gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc. (NYSE: V). In the second quarter of 2009, significant items included provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $466 million, net securities losses of $19 million, a $123 million accrual for an FDIC special assessment and $154 million of accelerated amortization of a discount associated with TARP preferred stock redeemed on June 17, 2009. These items, in total, reduced second quarter of 2009 diluted earnings per common share by $.34. First quarter of 2010 earnings were impacted by $175 million of provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs and $34 million of net

securities losses. These items, in total, reduced first quarter of 2010 diluted earnings per common share by approximately $.08.
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "I am very proud of our second quarter results and accomplishments. The Company's net income of $766 million in the second quarter of 2010 was 62.6 percent higher than same quarter of 2009 and 14.5 percent greater than the previous quarter. Our earnings were driven by record total net revenue and lower credit costs. On-going investments and business line growth initiatives, as well as recent acquisitions, contributed to the increase in net revenue. Growth in earning assets and deposits, coupled with an expanded net interest margin, led to a 14.5 percent increase in net interest income year-over-year, while strong results from our payments businesses and corporate banking group benefited total noninterest income.
     "Credit quality showed marked improvement in the second quarter, as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined from the levels recorded in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally, although the Company recorded $25 million of provision in excess of net charge-offs in the second quarter, it was significantly lower than the $175 million and $466 million of excess provision recorded in the first quarter of 2010 and second quarter of 2009, respectively. With these positive changes in our credit metrics, as well as other indications of ongoing improvement in the portfolio, we believe the Company has reached the inflection point in credit quality and we expect net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to be lower in the third quarter than the current quarter.
     "The Company's capital position remains strong. Capital generated from earnings resulted in a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.1 percent and a Tier 1 common ratio of 7.4 percent at June 30th, both above the ratios posted at the end of the first quarter of 9.9 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. On June 15, 2010, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $.05 per common share, equal to the dividend declared for the last five quarters. Raising the dividend continues to be a priority for our board of directors and senior management. As we have said before, we are confident that our results can support a higher dividend, but we continue to wait for further evidence of a sustainable economic recovery and guidance from our regulators regarding the capital levels that our Company and our industry must maintain going forward.
     "The recent passing of regulatory reform legislation brings about a number of changes that will, we believe, increase accountability and transparency within the financial services industry. We continue to fully support effective industry regulation and consumer protection that create a stronger, safer financial system. As we have communicated in the past, however, a number of provisions within this legislation will impact

     our Company by either lowering revenue, increasing expense and/or raising capital requirements. All are manageable given our momentum, size, risk profile and diversified business mix. Regulatory reform will not be without its challenges and a certain degree of uncertainty for all of us in the financial services industry, but we will continue to work closely with our regulators, government representatives and other industry participants to ensure that our Company and our industry continue to play a central role in the economic recovery and long term growth of the economy.
     "Our Company's results this quarter demonstrated the underlying strength of our franchise and provided further evidence that our growth initiatives and investments are taking hold. In May, we successfully converted the 150 branches acquired last October from FBOP Corporation in an FDIC-assisted deal, an acquisition that significantly expanded our presence in California and in the Chicago market. All bank and major card portfolio acquisition-related systems integration activity is now behind us, enabling us to turn our full attention to capitalizing on our expanded distribution and growth initiatives, while keeping our capacity to integrate future deals fully intact. Over the past many months, a time of both economic uncertainty and industry change, we have maintained our strong defense, while establishing our new offense. We have continued to invest, grow and remain focused on the future. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their support, hard work and dedication, as we are now well on our way to exceeding our goals for this year."

     Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the second quarter of 2010 was $295 million (62.6 percent) higher than the same period of 2009 and $97 million (14.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2010. The increase in net income year-over-year was principally the result of strong growth in total net revenue, driven by an increase in both net interest income and fee-based revenue, and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense. Compared with the prior quarter, favorable variances in total net revenue and the provision for credit losses were partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense.
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the second quarter of 2010 was $4,519 million; $360 million (8.7 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2009, reflecting a 14.5 percent increase in net interest income and a 2.7 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was largely the result of continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding and an increase in average earning assets, primarily related to acquisitions. Noninterest income increased year-over-year as a result of higher payments-related and commercial products revenue and other income. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $198 million (4.6 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to a

U.S. Bancorp Reports Second quarter 2010 Results July 21, 2010 Page 7
10.0 percent increase in noninterest income, driven by higher payments-related revenue, commercial products revenue, mortgage banking revenue and other income.
     Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2010 was $2,377 million; $248 million (11.6 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2009, and $241 million (11.3 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2010. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, compensation and employee benefits expense and costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects. The increase in total noninterest expense compared with the first quarter of 2010 was primarily due to an increase in total compensation expense and costs related to affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects and seasonally lower professional services and marketing and business development expenses in the prior quarter. In addition, other noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was higher due to acquisition integration expense, debt extinguishment costs and expenses related to insurance and litigation matters.
     The Company's provision for credit losses declined from a year ago and on a linked quarter basis. The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2010 was $1,139 million, $171 million lower than the first quarter of 2010 and $256 million lower than the second quarter of 2009. The provision for credit losses exceeded net charge-offs by $25 million in the second quarter of 2010, $175 million in the first quarter of 2010, and $466 million in the second quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2010 were $1,114 million, lower than the $1,135 million in the first quarter of 2010, but higher than the $929 million in the second quarter of 2009. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to continue to trend lower in the third quarter of 2010.
     Nonperforming assets include assets originated by the Company, as well as loans and other real estate acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements ("covered assets") that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. Excluding covered assets, nonperforming assets were $3,734 million at June 30, 2010, $3,995 million at March 31, 2010, and $3,334 million at June 30, 2009. The decline on a linked quarter basis was principally in the construction and land development portfolios, as the Company continued to resolve and reduce exposure to these problem assets. The year-over-year increase was driven by stress in the residential mortgage portfolio, as well as an increase in foreclosed properties and the impact of the economic slowdown on commercial and consumer customers. Covered nonperforming assets were $2,151 million at June 30, 2010, $2,385 million at March 31, 2010, and $682 million at June 30, 2009. The majority of the nonperforming covered assets were considered credit-impaired at acquisition and were recorded at

U.S. Bancorp Reports Second quarter 2010 Results July 21, 2010 Page 8
their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The year-over-year increase in covered nonperforming assets was due to the fourth quarter of 2009 acquisition of the banking operations of First Bank of Oak Park Corporation ("FBOP"). The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered loans, was 3.18 percent at June 30, 2010, compared with 3.20 percent at March 31, 2010, and 2.66 percent at June 30, 2009. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered loans, was 2.89 percent at June 30, 2010, compared with 2.85 percent at March 31, 2010, and 2.51 percent at June 30, 2009. The Company expects total nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, to continue to trend lower in the third quarter.
 
Net Interest Income
     Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the second quarter of 2010 was $2,409 million, compared with $2,104 million in the seconds quarter of 2009, an increase of $305 million (14.5 percent). The increase was the result of growth in average earning assets and an expanded net interest margin. Average earning assets were higher by $13.2 billion (5.6 percent) than the second quarter of 2009, driven by an
(MORE)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second quarter 2010 Results July 21, 2010 Page 9
increase of $7.3 billion (4.0 percent) in average loans and $5.0 billion (11.7 percent) in average investment securities, while the net interest margin was higher principally due to the impact of favorable funding rates and improved credit spreads. Net interest income was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis, as a decrease in average earning assets was offset by favorable funding costs and day basis. During the second quarter of 2010, the net interest margin was 3.90 percent compared with 3.60 percent in the second quarter of 2009 and 3.90 percent in the first quarter of 2010.
     Total average loans were $7.3 billion (4.0 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2010 than the second quarter of 2009, driven by the FBOP acquisition and growth in residential mortgages (11.9 percent) and retail loans (3.2 percent). These increases were partially offset by a $7.7 billion decline in total average commercial loans, principally due to lower utilization of existing commitments and reduced demand for new loans. Year-over-year retail loan growth was driven by an increase in credit cards. Included in the growth in credit cards were portfolio purchases of $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2009 and $.5 billion in May 2010. Total average loans were $1.7 billion (.9 percent) lower in the second quarter of 2010 than the first quarter of 2010, as an increase in residential mortgages (1.6 percent) was offset by a decline in covered loans (4.5

percent) and total commercial loans (2.0 percent), primarily due to lower commitment utilization by corporate customers and reduced demand for new loans from credit-worthy borrowers.
     Average investment securities in the second quarter of 2010 were $5.0 billion (11.7 percent) higher year-over-year and $929 million (2.0 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2010. The increases over the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to purchases of U.S. government agency-backed securities.
     Average total deposits for the second quarter of 2010 were $20.1 billion (12.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2009. Excluding deposits from acquisitions, average total deposits increased $6.7 billion (4.1 percent) over the second quarter of 2009. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.5 billion (6.8 percent) year-over-year, due to growth in corporate trust and institutional trust balances, Consumer and Wholesale Banking business line balances and the impact of acquisitions. Average total savings deposits were $22.9 billion (29.7 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in Consumer Banking, broker- dealer, institutional and corporate trust balances and the impact of acquisitions. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were $988 million (5.5 percent) lower year-over-year, as a decrease in Consumer Banking balances was partially offset by acquisition-related growth. Average time deposits greater than $100,000 were lower by $4.3 billion (13.9 percent), reflecting a decrease in overall wholesale funding requirements, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.
     Average total deposits increased $787 million (.4 percent) over the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to growth in average noninterest-bearing deposits and total average savings deposits, which increased $1.9

billion (5.0 percent) and $869 million (.9 percent), respectively. These positive variances were partially offset by lower time deposits. The growth in average noninterest-bearing deposits was principally due to seasonally higher government-related deposits and higher balances in Consumer Banking, corporate trust and Wholesale Banking. Total average savings deposits increased on a linked quarter basis as the result of increases in Consumer Banking, corporate trust and institutional trust, partially offset by a decline in broker-dealer balances. The reduction in average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 reflected maturities and fewer renewals given the low interest rate environment, while the decline in average time certificates of deposit greater than $100,000 reflected the decrease in overall wholesale funding requirements.
Noninterest Income
     Second quarter noninterest income was $2,110 million; $55 million (2.7 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2009 and $192 million (10.0 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2010. Year-over-year, noninterest income benefited from payments-related revenues, which were $59 million (8.4 percent) higher, principally due to increased volumes, and a $61 million (42.4 percent) increase in commercial products revenue, attributable to higher standby letters of credit fees, commercial loan fees and syndication revenue. Other income was $80 million (88.9 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2009 due to a $28 million gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc., a favorable variance in income from equity

investments relative to losses recorded in the prior year, and an improvement in retail lease residual losses. Trust and investment management fees declined $37 million (12.2 percent) year-over-year, as low interest rates negatively impacted money market investment fees and lower money market fund balances led to a decline in account-level fees. Deposit service charges decreased $51 million (20.4 percent) as a result of revised overdraft fee policies and lower overdraft incidences. Mortgage banking revenue declined $65 million (21.1 percent) from the second quarter of 2009 principally driven by lower production revenue, which was partially offset by higher servicing income and a favorable net change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") and related economic hedging activities.
     Noninterest income was $192 million (10.0 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2010 than the first quarter of 2010. A $46 million (6.4 percent) increase in payments-related revenue was driven by seasonally higher transaction volumes. Treasury management fees increased $8 million (5.8 percent), principally due to seasonally higher government-related processing, while commercial products revenue was $44 million (27.3 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2010 as a result of higher syndication fees related to loan and tax-advantaged investment transactions. Mortgage banking revenue increased $43 million (21.5 percent) due to higher mortgage production and a favorable net change in the valuation of MSRs and related economic hedging activities. The $35 million (25.9 percent) increase in other income on a linked quarter basis principally reflected a $28 million gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc. Partially offsetting these variances on a linked quarter basis was a decrease in deposit service charges of $8 million (3.9 percent) largely due to the impact of revised overdraft fee policies, partially offset by seasonally higher volumes.

Noninterest Expense
     Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2010 totaled $2,377 million, an increase of $248 million (11.6 percent) over the second quarter of 2009, and a $241 million increase (11.3 percent) from the first quarter of 2010. The increase in noninterest expense over a year ago was principally due to the impact of acquisitions and increased compensation expense. Compensation expense increased $182 million (23.8 percent) and employee benefits expense increased $32 million (22.9 percent), primarily reflecting acquisitions, higher incentives related to the Company's improved financial results, merit increases, pension costs and the five percent cost reduction program that was in effect during the second quarter of 2009. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $18 million (8.7 percent), principally due to acquisitions and other business initiatives. Professional services expense was $14 million (23.7 percent) higher year-over-year, due to acquisitions, payments-related projects and legal costs. Marketing and business development expense increased $6 million (7.5 percent) over the prior year largely due to cost containment initiatives that were in place in 2009. Technology and communications expense increased $29 million (18.5 percent), as a result of payments-related initiatives, including the formation of a joint venture in 2009. Other expense decreased $32 million (5.8 percent) mainly due to the $123 million FDIC special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by increases in costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects, higher merchant processing expense and costs for debt extinguishment associated with the income trust securities exchange and other real estate owned.
     Noninterest expense increased $241 million (11.3 percent) in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2010. Compensation expense increased $85 million (9.9 percent), principally due to higher incentives and commissions, the impact of the March annual merit increases and seasonally higher contract labor expense. Professional services expense was higher by $15 million (25.9 percent) due to seasonally lower expense in the first quarter of 2010. Marketing and business development expense was higher by $26 million (43.3 percent), compared with the first quarter of 2010, reflecting the timing of credit card product initiatives and other marketing campaigns. Other expense increased $128 million (32.5 percent) over the first quarter of 2010, largely due to acquisition integration expense, costs related to affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects, debt extinguishment costs associated with the income trust securities exchange, and expenses related to insurance and litigation matters.

Provision for Income Taxes
     The provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2010 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 25.0 percent (effective tax rate of 20.9 percent), compared with 23.6 percent (effective tax rate of 17.1 percent) in the second quarter of 2009 and 24.2 percent (effective tax rate of 19.5 percent) in the first quarter of 2010. The increases in effective tax rate principally reflect the marginal impact of higher pretax earnings.

Credit Quality
     Net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a linked quarter basis as economic conditions moderated. The allowance for credit losses was $5,536 million at June 30, 2010, compared with $5,439 million at March 31, 2010, and $4,571 million at June 30, 2009. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2010 were $1,114 million, compared with $1,135 million in the first quarter of 2010, and $929 million in the second quarter of 2009. The increase in total net charge-offs compared with a year ago was driven by economic factors affecting the residential housing markets, including homebuilding and related industries, commercial real estate properties and credit costs associated with credit card and other consumer and commercial loans as the economy weakened. The Company recorded $25 million of provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs during the second quarter of 2010, increasing the allowance for credit losses. In addition, the Company increased the allowance for credit losses by $72 million to reflect covered loan losses reimbursable by the FDIC.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs increased to $472 million in the second quarter of 2010 (2.35 percent of average loans outstanding) compared with $469 million (2.34 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2010 and $353 million (1.61 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2009. The increases reflected stress in commercial real estate and residential housing, especially homebuilding and related industry sectors, along with the impact of current economic conditions on the Company's commercial loan portfolios.
     Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs decreased to $138 million (2.06 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010 from $145 million (2.23 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2010, reflecting the positive impact of restructuring programs, but were higher than the $116 million (1.94 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2009. Total retail loan net charge-offs were $499 million (3.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $518 million (3.30 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2010 and $458 million (2.99 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2009. The level of retail loan net-charge-offs was impacted by credit card portfolio purchases recorded at fair value in the beginning in the third quarter of 2009. The increased year-over-year residential mortgage and retail loan credit losses reflected the adverse impact of current economic conditions on consumers, as rising unemployment levels increased losses in prime-based portfolios.

     Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2010, totaled $5,885 million, compared with $6,380 million at March 31, 2010, and $4,016 million at June 30, 2009. Included in June 30, 2010, nonperforming assets were $2,151 million of assets covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 3.05 percent (2.17 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2010, compared with 3.31 percent (2.34 percent excluding covered assets) at March 31, 2010, and 2.20 percent (1.94 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2009. The increase in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, compared with a year ago was driven primarily by the residential construction portfolio and related industries and the residential

mortgage portfolio, as well as an increase in foreclosed residential properties and the impact of the economic slowdown on other commercial and consumer customers. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, to trend lower in the next quarter.
     Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $2,221 million ($1,239 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2010, compared with $2,138 million ($1,321 million excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2010, and $2,042 million ($1,245 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2009. Restructured loans that continue to accrue interest have increased, compared with the second quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, reflecting the impact of loan modifications for certain residential mortgage and consumer credit card customers in light of current economic conditions. The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are having financial difficulties, but expects increases in restructured loans to continue to moderate.
     Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders' equity was $28.2 billion at June 30, 2010, compared with $26.7 billion at March 31, 2010, and $24.2 billion at June 30, 2009.

Lines of Business
     The Company's major lines of business are Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Wealth Management & Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant

factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company's diverse customer base. During 2010, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.

Wholesale Banking contributed $82 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2010, compared with $68 million in the second quarter of 2009 and $2 million in the first quarter of 2010. Wholesale Banking's net income increased by $14 million (20.6 percent) over the same quarter of 2009, due to higher total net revenue, partially offset by higher total noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $5 million (1.0 percent) year-over-year due to improved spreads on loans, higher average deposit balances and an increase in loan fees, partially offset by a decrease in average total loans, a result of lower utilization of existing commitments and reduced demand for new loans and the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Total noninterest income increased $45 million (18.4 percent) due to strong growth in commercial products revenue including, standby letters of credit, commercial loan and capital markets fees and higher equity investment income. Total noninterest expense increased $38 million (13.4 percent) over a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense and increased costs related to other real estate owned. The provision for credit losses was $9 million (2.6 percent) lower year-over-year due to a decrease in the reserve allocation, partially offset by higher net charge-offs.
Wholesale Banking
     Wholesale Banking's contribution to net income in the second quarter of 2010 was $80 million higher than the first quarter of 2010. This improvement was due to a reduction in the provision for credit losses and higher total net revenue, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense. Total net revenue was higher due to favorable variances in both net interest income and total noninterest income. Net interest income was $21 million (4.4 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis as improved spreads on loans and an increase in loan fees were partially offset by a reduction in loan demand. The $16 million (5.8 percent) increase in total noninterest income was the result of higher commercial products revenue due to syndication and other capital markets-related income, partially offset by lower equity investment income. Total noninterest expense increased by $37 million (13.0 percent) principally due to higher compensation and

employee benefits expense, higher costs for other real estate owned and seasonally higher processing costs. The provision for credit losses decreased $127 million (27.0 percent) on a linked quarter basis due to lower net charge-offs and a decrease in allocated reserves.

Within Consumer Banking, the retail banking division accounted for $42 million of the total contribution, 17.6 percent below the same quarter of last year, and 55.8 percent lower than the previous quarter. The decline in the retail banking division's contribution from the same period of 2009 was due to lower total net revenue and higher total noninterest expense, partially offset by a favorable change in the provision for credit losses. Retail banking's net interest income increased 2.0 percent over the second quarter of 2009 due to improved spreads on loans and higher deposit volume and loans fees, partially offset by the impact of lower rates on the margin benefit of deposits. Total noninterest income for the retail banking division decreased 7.0 percent from a year ago due to lower deposit service charges principally due to the impact of revised overdraft fee policies and lower overdraft incidences, partially offset by improvement in retail lease residual valuation losses, higher ATM processing services fees and increased income from equity investments. Total noninterest expense for the retail banking division in the second quarter of 2010 was 9.5 percent higher year-over-year, principally due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense, higher processing costs and net occupancy and equipment expenses related to business expansion. The provision for credit losses for the retail banking division was lower than the same quarter of last year, as stress within the residential mortgages, home equity, and other installment and consumer loan portfolios moderated. In the second quarter of 2010, the mortgage banking division's contribution was $136 million, a 15.0 decrease from the second quarter of 2009. The division's total net revenue decreased 10.6 percent from a year ago, reflecting lower mortgage loan production, including lower interest income on average mortgage loans held for sale. Total noninterest expense for the mortgage banking division increased 5.8 percent over the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher servicing costs associated with other real estate owned and foreclosures. The provision for credit losses decreased 29.4 percent year-over-year for the mortgage banking division.

Total noninterest income increased $65 million (9.0 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to increased volumes across all products. Total noninterest expense increased $66 million (16.6 percent), driven by higher compensation and employee benefits expense, technology and communications expense, which was the result of increased volume and the formation of a joint venture, and higher other intangibles expense. The provision for credit losses decreased $150 million (29.5 percent) due to a favorable change in the reserve allocation due to improved loss rates, partially offset by reserve build related to credit card portfolio purchases.
Payment Services
     Payment Services' contribution in the second quarter of 2010 was $61 million (51.3 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2010 and was driven by a lower provision for credit losses and higher total net revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable variance in total noninterest expense. Total net revenue increased $34 million (3.1 percent) over the first quarter of 2010.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Global and domestic economies could fail to recover from the recent economic downturn or could experience another severe contraction, which could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp's revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a delay or failure of recovery in the residential real estate markets, could cause additional credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp's business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment, by increased regulation of financial institutions or other effects of recently enacted legislation, and by changes in the competitive landscape. U.S. Bancorp's results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, legal risk, and regulatory and compliance risk.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Corporate Risk Profile" contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.
Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
(MORE)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Second quarter 2010 Results July 21, 2010 Page 29
These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders' equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company's calculation of the non-regulatory capital ratios.
