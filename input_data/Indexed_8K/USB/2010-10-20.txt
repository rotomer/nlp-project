Exhibit 99.1
          U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $908 million for the third quarter of 2010, or $.45 per diluted common share. Earnings for the third quarter were driven by record total net revenue of $4.6 billion. Highlights for the third quarter of 2010 included:

     Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $908 million for the third quarter of 2010, 50.6 percent higher than the $603 million for the third quarter of 2009 and 18.5 percent higher than the $766 million for the second quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per common share of $.45 in the third quarter of 2010 were $.15 higher than the third quarter of 2009 and equal to the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.26 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2010, compared with .90 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2009. Significant items in the third quarter of 2009 that impact the comparison of results included provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $415 million, net securities losses of $76 million and a $39 million gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc. (NYSE: V). Diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter of 2010 included $.05 related to the issuance of perpetual preferred stock in exchange for certain income trust securities, net of related debt extinguishment costs. Additional significant items in the second quarter of 2010 included provision for credit losses in excess of net-charge-offs of $25 million, net securities losses of $21 million and a $28 million gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc.
     U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "Our third quarter results, once again, reflected the Company's financial strength, fundamental operating model and business line momentum, as record total net revenue and reduced credit costs drove third quarter net income of $908 million, or $.45 per diluted common share. Growth in total net revenue year-over-year can be

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 4
attributed to an increase in net interest income, the result of higher earning assets and an expanded net interest margin. Noninterest income grew, albeit at a slower pace, year-over-year, as increases in payments-related revenue and our other fee-based businesses were partly offset by expected headwinds from recent legislative actions and current economic conditions.
     "Although total average loans, excluding acquisitions, were down slightly year-over-year, the Company recorded an increase in average loans quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, average commercial loans were higher on a linked quarter basis, as the utilization rate on commercial commitments stabilized. This is the first linked quarter increase in average commercial loans since the fourth quarter of 2008.
     "Credit quality continued to show noticeable improvement this quarter, as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined. The provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs in the third quarter, as the need to build the allowance for credit losses diminished with the quarter's improved credit trends and relative stabilization of economic conditions. As I indicated last quarter, we have reached the inflection point in credit quality. Credit costs peaked for our Company in the first quarter of 2010. Despite this on-going improvement in credit quality, we did not reduce the allowance for credit losses this quarter, as our consumer loans continued to grow and the economy, although showing signs of stability, continues to hold a degree of uncertainty with high unemployment and a challenging real estate market. Moreover, as we move through this cycle, we are mindful of the need to continue to protect our fortress balance sheet.
     "In regard to the mortgage industry and recent questions concerning the validity of some foreclosures, I would like to reiterate our Company's primary goal, which is to keep borrowers in their homes whenever possible. We actively participate in a number of loan modification programs that help to establish affordable payment options for our customers. Unfortunately, in some instances foreclosure, although a last resort effort, is a necessary step. We routinely review our procedures and we have confirmed that we have strong processes and controls in place to ensure that our affidavits are accurate and that no one is wrongfully foreclosed upon. We are able to closely manage the foreclosure process internally, given the manageable size and quality of our portfolio. We will continue to review our processes going forward and comply with any information requests received from regulatory and governmental authorities. We do believe, however, that a blanket foreclosure moratorium should be avoided in the interest of the national economic recovery.
     "Our Company's capital position remains strong, and growing, with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 7.6 percent and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.3 percent at September 30th. Raising the dividend remains a top priority for our management team and board of directors. We continue, however, to wait for final regulatory

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 5
capital guidelines to be established. Our current capital position and our ability to generate new capital each quarter through earnings give us confidence that we can meet or exceed any capital requirements that may be forthcoming, and be one of the first banks to gain regulatory approval to raise our dividend.
     "On September 15th, our management team hosted an investor conference in New York City. The theme of the day was "positioned to win," and the day's presentations led the audience of investors and analysts through a discussion on how our Company has prudently managed the fundamental elements of the business, how we have continued to invest in and enhance our business model over the past few years, and how we are managing and positioning each businesses line for future growth. We demonstrated how, by not changing course or succumbing to the easy growth strategies of the recent pre-crisis years, we have been able to manage well through a very challenging and uncertain economic environment, while positioning the Company to gain market share, produce industry-leading revenue growth, and achieve superior financial performance. I would not exchange our position in the industry for any other. We are moving forward with a sense of optimism and enthusiasm, focused on growing our businesses, sustaining an engaged and performance-driven workforce that provides superior service to our customers and communities and, importantly, creating long-term value for our shareholders."

     Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the third quarter of 2010 was $305 million (50.6 percent) higher than the same period of 2009 and $142 million (18.5 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010. The increase in net income year-over-year was principally the result of strong growth in total net revenue, driven by an increase in both net interest income and fee-based revenue, and a lower provision for credit losses. These positive variances were partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense. Compared with the prior quarter, favorable variances in total net revenue and the provision for credit losses were partly offset by a small increase in total noninterest expense.
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2010 was $4,587 million; $337 million (7.9 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2009, reflecting a 14.8 percent increase in net interest income and a .8 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was largely the result of an increase in average earning assets, primarily related to acquisitions, and continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding. Noninterest income increased year-over-year as a result of higher payments-related revenue, commercial products revenue and mortgage banking revenue. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $68 million (1.5 percent) higher on a linked quarter

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 7
basis, due to a 2.8 percent increase in net interest income, driven by higher average loan and loans held-for-sale balances.
     Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2010 was $2,385 million; $332 million (16.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2009, and $8 million (.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and compensation and employee benefits expense. Total noninterest expense was relatively flat compared with the second quarter of 2010 with favorable variances in most expense categories being partially offset by higher compensation, marketing and business development and professional services expense.
     The Company's provision for credit losses declined from a year ago and on a linked quarter basis. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2010 was $995 million, $144 million lower than the second quarter of 2010 and $461 million lower than the third quarter of 2009. The provision for credit losses equaled net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2010, but exceeded net charge-offs by $25 million in the second quarter of 2010, and by $415 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2010 were $995 million, lower than the $1,114 million in the second quarter of 2010, and the $1,041 million in the third quarter of 2009. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to continue to trend lower in the fourth quarter of 2010.
     Nonperforming assets include assets originated by the Company, as well as loans and other real estate acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements ("covered assets") that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. Excluding covered assets, nonperforming assets were $3,563 million at September 30, 2010, $3,734 million at June 30, 2010, and $3,720 million at September 30, 2009. The decline on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis was led by reductions in the construction and land development nonperforming portfolios, as the Company continued to resolve and reduce exposure to these problem assets. There was also improvement in the other commercial portfolios as the economy began to stabilize. However, there is continued stress in the residential mortgage and credit card portfolios, as well as an increase in foreclosed properties, due to the impact of the overall duration of the economic slowdown. Covered nonperforming assets were $1,851 million at September 30, 2010, $2,151 million at June 30, 2010, and $672 million at September 30, 2009. The majority of the nonperforming covered assets were considered credit-impaired at acquisition and were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The year-over-year increase in covered nonperforming assets was due to the fourth quarter of 2009 acquisition of the banking operations of First Bank of Oak Park Corporation ("FBOP"). The ratio of the allowance for

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 8
credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered loans, was 3.10 percent at September 30, 2010, compared with 3.18 percent at June 30, 2010, and 2.88 percent at September 30, 2009. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered loans, was 2.85 percent at September 30, 2010, compared with 2.89 percent at June 30, 2010, and 2.73 percent at September 30, 2009. The Company expects total nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, to continue to trend lower in the fourth quarter

Net Interest Income
     Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the third quarter of 2010 was $2,477 million, compared with $2,157 million in the third quarter of 2009, an increase of $320 million (14.8 percent). The increase was the result of growth in average earning assets and an expanded net interest margin. Average earning assets were $17.8 billion (7.6 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2009, driven by increases of $10.6 billion (5.8 percent) in average loans and $5.3 billion (12.5 percent) in average investment securities, while the net interest margin was higher principally due to the impact of favorable funding rates and improved credit spreads. Net interest income increased $68 million (2.8 percent) on a linked quarter basis,
(MORE)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 9
mainly as a result of an increase in average earning assets and day basis. During the third quarter of 2010, the net interest margin was 3.91 percent, compared with 3.67 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and 3.90 percent in the second quarter of 2010.
     Total average loans were $10.6 billion (5.8 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2010 than the third quarter of 2009, driven by the FBOP acquisition and growth in residential mortgages (14.3 percent) and retail loans (3.4 percent). These increases were partially offset by an 8.7 percent decline in total average commercial loans, principally due to lower utilization of existing commitments and reduced demand for new loans. Year-over-year retail loan growth was driven by increases in credit cards and installment loans. Included in the growth of average credit card loans outstanding were portfolio purchases of $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2009 and $.5 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Total average loans were $1.4 billion (.7 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2010 than the second quarter of 2010, as increases in the majority of loan categories, principally residential mortgages (4.0 percent) and other retail loans (4.0 percent), were partially offset by lower covered loans (5.6 percent). Relatively stable commitment utilization by corporate

customers and a higher demand for new loans from credit-worthy borrowers resulted in a modest increase in total commercial and commercial real estate balances.
     Average investment securities in the third quarter of 2010 were $5.3 billion (12.5 percent) higher year-over-year and $730 million (1.5 percent) higher than the prior quarter. The increases over the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to purchases of U.S. government agency-backed securities.
     Average total deposits for the third quarter of 2010 were $16.3 billion (9.8 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2009. Excluding deposits from acquisitions, average total deposits increased $4.5 billion (2.7 percent) over the third quarter of 2009. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.8 billion (7.4 percent) year-over-year, due to growth in the Consumer and Wholesale Banking business line balances and the impact of acquisitions. Average total savings deposits were $13.9 billion (16.3 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in Consumer Banking, Wholesale Banking, institutional and corporate trust balances, and the impact of acquisitions. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were $961 million (5.7 percent) lower year-over-year, as a decrease in Consumer Banking balances was partially offset by acquisition-related growth. Average time deposits greater than $100,000 were higher by $617 million (2.3 percent), reflecting the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in required overall wholesale funding.
     Average total deposits decreased $658 million (.4 percent) from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to declines in average time deposits less than $100,000 of $956 million (5.6 percent) and average total

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 11
savings deposits of $473 million (.5 percent), partially offset by an increase in average time deposits over $100,000 of $956 million (3.6 percent). Total average savings deposits decreased on a linked quarter basis, principally due to a decline in corporate trust and institutional trust and broker-dealer balances, partially offset by higher Consumer Banking balances. The reduction in average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 reflected maturities and fewer renewals given the low interest rate environment, while the increase in average time certificates of deposit greater than $100,000 reflected wholesale funding decisions.
Noninterest Income
     Third quarter noninterest income was $2,110 million; $17 million (.8 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2009 and equal to the second quarter of 2010. Year-over-year, noninterest income benefited from payments-related revenues, which were $35 million (4.7 percent) higher, largely due to increased transaction volumes, and a $40 million (25.5 percent) increase in commercial products revenue, attributable to higher standby letters of credit fees, commercial loan fees and syndication revenue. Additionally, mortgage banking revenue was higher than the same quarter of 2009 by $34 million (12.3 percent), driven by higher production and servicing revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") and related economic hedging activities. Total noninterest income was also favorably impacted by a year-over-year change in net securities losses, which were $67 million (88.2
(MORE)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 12
percent) lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower impairments. Trust and investment management fees declined $26 million (8.9 percent) year-over-year, as low interest rates negatively impacted money market investment fees and lower money market fund balances led to a decline in account-level fees. Deposit service charges decreased $96 million (37.5 percent) as a result of revised overdraft fee policies and lower overdraft incidences. Other income was $37 million (22.0 percent) lower than the prior year primarily due to the third quarter of 2009 gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc. and lower customer derivative revenue, partially offset by improved retail lease residual valuation income and higher income from equity investments.
     Noninterest income was $2,110 million in both the third quarter and second quarter of 2010. Payments-related revenue increased $19 million (2.5 percent), primarily driven by seasonally higher transaction volumes in corporate payment products. Mortgage banking revenue increased $67 million (27.6 percent) due to strong mortgage production, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in the valuation of MSRs and related economic hedging activities. The $12 million (57.1 percent) favorable change in net securities losses on a linked quarter basis was primarily due to higher securities gains in the current quarter. Offsetting these favorable variances on a linked quarter basis were declines in deposit service charges of $39 million (19.6 percent), reflecting the impact of revised overdraft fee policies, treasury management fees of $6 million (4.1 percent), owing to seasonally lower government-related processing, and commercial products revenue of $8 million (3.9 percent), mainly due to lower syndication fees related to tax-advantaged investment transactions. In addition, other income was $39 million (22.9 percent) lower primarily due to a $28 million gain in the second quarter of 2010 related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc. and lower customer derivative revenue, partially offset by improved retail lease residual valuation income.

Noninterest Expense
     Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2010 totaled $2,385 million, an increase of $332 million (16.2 percent) over the third quarter of 2009, and an $8 million increase (.3 percent) over the second quarter of 2010. The increase in noninterest expense over a year ago was principally due to the impact of acquisitions and increased compensation expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased by $204 million (26.5 percent) and $37 million (27.6 percent), respectively, year-over-year, primarily because of acquisitions, higher incentives related to the Company's improved financial results, merit increases and the five percent cost reduction program that was in effect during the third quarter of 2009. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $26 million (12.8 percent), principally due to acquisitions and other business initiatives. Professional services expense was $15 million (23.8 percent) higher year-over-year, due to acquisitions, payments-related projects and legal costs. Technology and communications expense increased $11 million (6.3 percent), as a result of business initiatives and volume increases across various business lines. Other expense was higher by $70 million (17.2 percent) largely due to increases in costs related to investments in affordable housing and other real estate owned. Marketing and business development expense decreased $29 million (21.2 percent) from the prior year mainly due to payments-related initiatives during 2009, partially offset by a higher contribution to the Company's charitable foundation in the third quarter of 2010.
(MORE)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 14
     Noninterest expense was relatively flat on a linked quarter basis, increasing $8 million (.3 percent). Compensation expense increased $27 million (2.9 percent), principally due to higher incentives and commissions. Professional services expense was $5 million (6.8 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to payments-related initiatives. Marketing and business development expense was higher by $22 million (25.6 percent), compared with the second quarter of 2010, reflecting an increase in the Company's contribution to its charitable foundation, partially offset by the timing of credit card product initiatives and other marketing campaigns. Offsetting these unfavorable variances, was a $46 million (8.8 percent) decrease in other expense on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to a reduction in conversion costs related to the FBOP acquisition and the impact of debt extinguishment costs associated with the income trust securities exchange that was completed and recorded in the prior quarter.
Provision for Income Taxes
     The provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2010 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 25.9 percent (effective tax rate of 22.5 percent), compared with 18.4 percent (effective tax rate of 12.4 percent) in the third quarter of 2009 and 25.0 percent (effective tax rate of 20.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2010. The increases in effective tax rate principally reflected the marginal impact of higher pretax earnings.

Credit Quality
     Net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a linked quarter basis as economic conditions moderated. The allowance for credit losses was $5,540 million at September 30, 2010, compared with $5,536 million at June 30, 2010, and $4,986 million at September 30, 2009. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2010 were $995 million, compared with $1,114 million in the second quarter of 2010, and $1,041 million in the third quarter of 2009. The decrease in total net charge-offs was principally due to improvement in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. The Company recorded $995 million of provision for credit losses, equal to net charge-offs during the third quarter of 2010. The allowance for credit losses reimbursable by the FDIC was higher by $4 million, which increased the total allowance for credit losses by the same amount.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs decreased to $378 million in the third quarter of 2010 (1.85 percent of average loans outstanding) compared with $472 million (2.35 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010 and $433 million (2.02 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2009. The decrease primarily reflected the resolution of certain major construction projects and the impact of more stable economic conditions on the Company's commercial loan portfolios.
     Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs decreased to $132 million (1.88 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010 from $138 million (2.06 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010, reflecting the positive impact of restructuring programs. Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs in the current quarter remained higher, however, than the $129 million (2.10 percent of average loans outstanding) recorded in the third quarter of 2009. Total retail loan net charge-offs were $478 million (2.95 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010, lower than the $499 million (3.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010 and the $479 million (3.05 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2009. The level of retail loan net-charge-offs was impacted by credit card portfolio purchases recorded at fair value in the beginning in the third quarter of 2009.
     The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.85 percent (3.10 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010, compared with 2.89 percent (3.18 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2010, and 2.73 percent (2.88 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2009. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 133 percent (181 percent excluding covered

loans) at September 30, 2010, compared with 120 percent (168 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2010, and 136 percent (150 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2009.

     Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2010, totaled $5,414 million, compared with $5,885 million at June 30, 2010, and $4,392 million at September 30, 2009. Total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2010, included $1,851 million of assets covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 2.76 percent (2.02 percent excluding covered assets) at September 30, 2010, compared with 3.05 percent (2.17 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2010, and 2.39 percent (2.14 percent excluding covered assets) at September 30, 2009. The decrease in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, compared with a year ago was driven primarily by the construction and land development portfolios,

U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 19
as well as improvement in other commercial portfolios. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, to trend lower in the fourth quarter.
     Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $2,110 million ($1,165 million excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010, compared with $2,221 million ($1,239 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2010, and $2,125 million ($1,344 million excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2009. The increase in restructured loans that continue to accrue interest, compared with the third quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2010, reflected the impact of loan modifications for certain residential mortgage and consumer credit card customers in light of current economic conditions.

(a) preliminary data
Lines of Business
     The Company's major lines of business are Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Wealth Management & Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced,

Total noninterest expense increased $49 million (18.2 percent) over a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense and increased costs related to other real estate owned. The provision for credit losses was $141 million (32.9 percent) lower year-over-year due to a reduction in the reserve allocation and a decrease in net charge-offs.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Global and domestic economies could fail to recover from the recent economic downturn or could experience another severe contraction, which could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp's revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a delay or failure of recovery in the residential real estate markets, could cause additional credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp's business and financial performance is likely to be impacted by effects of recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp's results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, residual value risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Corporate Risk Profile" contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.
Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
(MORE)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Third quarter 2010 Results October 20, 2010 Page 28
These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders' equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company's calculation of the non-regulatory capital ratios.
