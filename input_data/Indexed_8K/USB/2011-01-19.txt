Exhibit 99.1
          U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $974 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, or $.49 per diluted common share. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were driven by record total net revenue of $4.7 billion. Included in the fourth quarter of 2010 results was a $103 million gain ($41 million after tax) from the exchange of the long-term asset management business of FAF Advisors, Inc., an affiliate of the Company, for an equity interest in Nuveen Investments and cash consideration ("Nuveen Gain"). Additional significant items included a provision for credit losses lower than net charge-offs by $25 million and net securities losses of $14 million. In total, these items increased fourth quarter 2010 diluted earnings per common share by $.03. Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2010 included:

     Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $974 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, 61.8 percent higher than the $602 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 7.3 percent higher than the $908 million for the third quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per common share of $.49 in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $.19 higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 and $.04 higher than the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.31 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with .86 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2009. Significant items in the fourth quarter of 2010, including the Nuveen Gain and a provision for credit losses less than net-charge-offs by $25 million, partially offset by net securities losses, resulted in a $.03 increase to diluted

earnings per common share. Significant items in the fourth quarter of 2009 that impact the comparison to current quarter results included provision for credit losses in excess of net charge-offs of $278 million and net securities losses of $158 million.
          U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "I am very proud of our Company's fourth quarter performance. Net income of $974 million, or $.49 per diluted common share, was driven, once again, by record total net revenue and declining credit costs. The results continued to reflect the benefits of our diversified business model, our recent investments and overall financial strength.
          "The Company posted both year-over-year and linked quarter average total loan growth in the fourth quarter. The 1.5 percent linked quarter growth in total average loans (2.1 percent without covered assets) was supported by increases in all major loan categories. Importantly, this was the second consecutive quarter of growth in average commercial loans, despite a nominal decrease in the commercial loan utilization rate, indicating new and expanded lending activity from our commercial customers. Total average deposits also increased on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis by 5.2 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.
          "At year end our Company closed two transactions. On December 30th, we completed the acquisition of a securitization trust administration business. This transaction, which included $1.1 trillion of assets under administration and provided U.S. Bank with approximately $8 billion of deposits at close, further strengthens our Company's position as a leader in the structured finance trust business and is a great complement to our corporate and municipal trust business. It is a perfect example of the type of acquisition that we will continue to search for, as it adds scale and market share to one of our capital efficient, high return, fee-based processing businesses. Also, on December 31st, we completed a transaction in which we exchanged the long-term asset management business of FAF Advisors, Inc. for an equity stake in Nuveen Investments. This transaction involved a business in which we did not have the scale and distribution capabilities to compete effectively. Going forward, our customers and shareholders will benefit from this new strategic alliance, as our new partner brings a broader array of investment and distribution capabilities to the alliance, enhancing the long-term value of our past investment in the asset management business.
          "Credit quality continued to improve in the fourth quarter. As expected, net charge-offs and nonperforming assets were lower than the previous quarter, declining by 5.8 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. Given these positive trends and improvement in the underlying risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio, we released $25 million of loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter  our first such action since

the beginning of this credit cycle. Going forward, we will continue to monitor the improving credit trends and maintain our reserves at the appropriate level, given the Company's overall risk profile, all the while preserving, at all times, the strength of our balance sheet.
          "We continued to generate significant capital this quarter, ending the year with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 7.8 percent and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5 percent. On January 7th, our Company, along with our peer banks, submitted a Comprehensive Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve System. As I have said before, raising the dividend remains a top priority for our management team and board of directors. Our strong capital position and ability to generate capital each quarter through solid operating earnings, even under the most severe economic conditions, gives us confidence in our ability to increase our dividend in 2011. Our shareholders deserve to be rewarded.
          "Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication, hard work and the many contributions they have made throughout this past year. 2010 represented one of our strongest annual performances in many years. It was a year filled with challenges, but also one filled with opportunities  opportunities to acquire new customers, improve our processes, expand our franchise and build upon our reputation as a trusted provider of financial products and services. We are larger and stronger than we were at the beginning of this year and continue to gain momentum during this economic cycle. We are "positioned to win"  capable and well-prepared to adapt to a changing economic, legislative and regulatory environment, and focused on growing our business and achieving industry-leading performance and returns for the benefit of our customers, employees, communities and, importantly, our shareholders."

     Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $372 million (61.8 percent) higher than the same period of 2009 and $66 million (7.3 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010. The increase in net income year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis was principally the result of strong growth in total net revenue, driven by an increase in both net interest income and fee-based revenue, and lower provision for credit losses. These positive variances were partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense.
     Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $4,721 million; $345 million (7.9 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting a 5.9 percent increase in net interest income and a 10.2 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was largely the result of an increase in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding. Noninterest income increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher payments-related revenue, commercial products revenue, mortgage banking revenue, other income and lower net securities losses. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $134 million (2.9 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, due to a .9 percent increase in net interest income and a 5.3 percent increase in noninterest income driven by higher payments-related revenue, trust and investment management fees, commercial

U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2010 Results January 19, 2011 Page 7
products revenue and other income. The positive variance in other income over the prior year and on a linked quarter basis reflected the impact of the Nuveen Gain.
     Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $2,485 million; $257 million (11.5 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2009, and $100 million (4.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation expense and employee benefits expense. The increase in total noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was due to higher compensation, professional services expense and seasonally higher investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects.
     The Company's provision for credit losses declined from a year ago and on a linked quarter basis. The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $912 million, $83 million lower than the third quarter of 2010 and $476 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2009. The provision for credit losses was $25 million lower than net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2010. In the third quarter of 2010, the provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs, while in the fourth quarter of 2009, it exceeded net charge-offs by $278 million. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $937 million, compared with $995 million in the third quarter of 2010, and $1,110 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to continue to trend lower in the first quarter of 2011.
     Nonperforming assets include assets originated by the Company, as well as loans and other real estate acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements ("covered assets") that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. Excluding covered assets, nonperforming assets were $3,351 million at December 31, 2010, $3,563 million at September 30, 2010, and $3,904 million at December 31, 2009. The decline on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis was led by reductions in nonperforming construction and land development assets as the Company continued to resolve and reduce exposure to these problem assets, in addition to improvement in other commercial portfolios, reflecting the stabilizing economy. However, there was continued stress in the residential mortgage portfolio, as well as an increase in foreclosed properties compared with a year ago, due to the overall duration of the economic slowdown. Covered nonperforming assets were $1,697 million at December 31, 2010, $1,851 million at September 30, 2010, and $2,003 million at December 31, 2009. The majority of the nonperforming covered assets were considered credit-impaired at acquisition and were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered loans, was 3.03 percent at December 31,

2010, compared with 3.10 percent at September 30, 2010, and 3.04 percent at December 31, 2009. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered loans, was 2.81 percent at December 31, 2010, compared with 2.85 percent at September 30, 2010, and 2.70 percent at December 31, 2009. The Company expects total nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, to continue to trend lower in the first quarter of 2011

Net Interest Income
     Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $2,499 million, compared with $2,360 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of $139 million (5.9 percent). The increase was principally the result of growth in average earning assets. Average earning assets were $14.5 billion (5.9 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by increases of $3.8 billion (2.0 percent) in average loans and $5.6 billion (12.8 percent) in average investment securities. Net interest income increased $22 million (.9 percent) on a linked quarter basis, mainly a result of an increase in average earning

assets. The net interest margin was 3.83 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009, and 3.91 percent in the third quarter of 2010. Net interest margin was flat year-over-year, as the impact of favorable funding rates was offset by a reduction in the yield on residential mortgages and investment securities. The decline in net interest margin on a linked quarter basis reflected the reduction in the yield on residential mortgages and investment securities and the impact of the new legislation on credit card yields.
     Total average loans were $3.8 billion (2.0 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 than the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by growth in residential mortgages (15.8 percent) and total retail loans (2.3 percent), driven principally by growth in installment loans. These increases were partially offset by a 4.5 percent decline in total average commercial loans, principally due to lower utilization of existing commitments and reduced demand for new loans. Total average loans were $2.9 billion (1.5 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 than the third quarter of 2010, as increases in the majority of loan categories, including residential mortgages (6.3 percent), other retail loans (2.9 percent) and total commercial loans (2.0 percent), were partially offset by lower covered loans (3.8 percent). These increases were driven by higher demand for loans and lines by new and existing credit-worthy borrowers.

     Average investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $5.6 billion (12.8 percent) higher year-over-year and $1.9 billion (4.0 percent) higher than the prior quarter. The increases over the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency-backed securities.
     Average total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $9.4 billion (5.2 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.0 billion (4.8 percent) year-over-year, principally due to growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking balances. Average total savings deposits were $10.9 billion (11.5 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking and institutional and corporate trust balances. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were $3.2 billion (17.5 percent) lower year-over-year, reflecting maturities and lower renewals given the current rate environment.
     Average total deposits increased $7.7 billion (4.2 percent) over the third quarter of 2010. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $3.2 billion (8.1 percent) with increases across the majority of the business lines. Total average savings deposits increased $5.7 billion (5.7 percent) on a linked quarter basis due to higher corporate trust and broker dealer balances and increased balances in Consumer and Small Business Banking. These increases were partially offset by declines in both average time deposits less than $100,000 of $812 million (5.1 percent) and average time deposits over $100,000 of $407 million (1.5 percent), reflecting maturities and lower renewals given the low interest rate environment and wholesale funding decisions.

Noninterest Income
     Fourth quarter noninterest income was $2,222 million; $206 million (10.2 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 and $112 million (5.3 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010. Year-over-year, noninterest income benefited from payments-related revenues, which were $38 million (5.1 percent) higher, largely due to increased transaction volumes and business expansion, and a $23 million (12.4 percent) increase in commercial products revenue, attributable to higher standby letters of credit fees, commercial loan and syndication fees and other capital markets revenue. Additionally, mortgage banking revenue was higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 by $32 million (14.7 percent), driven by higher origination and sales and servicing revenue, partially offset by a lower net valuation of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"). Total noninterest income was also favorably impacted by a year-over-year change in net securities losses, which were $144 million (91.1 percent), lower than the prior year. Other income increased by $50 million over the fourth quarter of 2009, principally due to the Nuveen Gain and a gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) ("Visa Gain"), partially offset by a fourth quarter of 2009 payments-related contract termination gain, lower customer derivative revenue and lower retail lease residual valuation income. Offsetting these positive variances was a decrease in deposit service charges of $94 million (39.5 percent) the result of revised overdraft fee policies, partially offset by core account growth.

     Noninterest income was $112 million (5.3 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 than the third quarter of 2010. Payments-related revenue increased $6 million (.8 percent), primarily driven by higher credit and debit card transaction volumes, partially offset by seasonally lower transaction volumes in corporate payment products. Trust and investment management fees were $15 million (5.6 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis principally due to the impact of improved market conditions. The increase in commercial products revenue of $11 million (5.6 percent) over the third quarter of 2010 was attributable to higher syndication fees, foreign exchange revenue, standby letters of credit fees and commercial loan fees. Other income increased by $164 million over the third quarter of 2010, principally due to the Nuveen Gain, the Visa Gain and higher customer derivative and equity investment revenue. Offsetting these favorable variances on a linked quarter basis were declines in deposit service charges of $16 million (10.0 percent), reflecting the impact of revised overdraft fee policies, and mortgage banking revenue of $60 million (19.4 percent) due to lower mortgage origination and sales revenue.

Noninterest Expense
     Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $2,485 million, an increase of $257 million (11.5 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2009, and a $100 million increase (4.2 percent) over the third quarter of 2010. The increase in noninterest expense over the same quarter of last year was principally due to the impact of acquisitions and increased compensation and employee benefits expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased by $183 million (22.4 percent) and $26 million (17.9 percent), respectively, year-over-year, primarily because of acquisitions, branch expansion and other business initiatives, higher incentives related to the Company's improved financial results and merit increases. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $23 million (10.7 percent), year-over-year, principally due to acquisitions and other business expansion and technology initiatives. Professional services expense was $16 million (19.8 percent) higher year-over-year, due to technology-related projects and other projects across multiple business lines. Postage, printing and supplies expense increased $8 million (11.4 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2009, principally due to payments-related business initiatives. Other expense was higher by $17 million (3.4 percent) largely due to costs associated with other real estate owned, acquisition integration and insurance and litigation matters. Other intangibles expense decreased $18 million compared with the prior year due to the reduction or completion of amortization of certain intangibles.
     Noninterest expense was $100 million (4.2 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis. Compensation expense increased $26 million (2.7 percent), principally due to branch expansion and other business initiatives, as well as higher commissions. Net occupancy and equipment was $8 million (3.5 percent) higher, primarily due to technology-related and other business initiatives. Professional services expense was $19 million (24.4 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to technology and customer experience-related projects and seasonality. In addition, other expense increased $45 million (9.5 percent) over the third quarter of 2010, principally due to seasonally higher investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects and higher acquisition integration costs, partially offset by lower costs associated with other real estate owned.

Provision for Income Taxes
     The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 27.8 percent (effective tax rate of 24.8 percent), compared with 20.8 percent (effective tax rate of 15.2 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 25.9 percent (effective tax rate of 22.5 percent) in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the effective tax rate principally reflected the marginal impact of higher pretax earnings and the Nuveen Gain.

Credit Quality
      Net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis as economic conditions stabilized. The allowance for credit losses was $5,531 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $5,540 million at September 30, 2010, and $5,264 million at December 31, 2009. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $937 million, compared with $995 million in the third quarter of 2010, and $1,110 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease in total net charge-offs was principally due to improvement in the commercial, credit card and other retail portfolios. The Company recorded $912 million of provision for credit losses, $25 million less than net charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2010. The allowance for credit losses reimbursable by the FDIC was higher by $16 million.
     Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs decreased to $353 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 (1.70 percent of average loans outstanding) compared with $378 million (1.85 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010 and $457 million (2.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease primarily reflected the impact of more stable economic conditions on the Company's commercial loan portfolios.
     Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs decreased to $131 million (1.75 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $132 million (1.88 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010 and $153 million (2.37 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total retail loan net charge-offs were $450 million (2.75 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2010, lower than the $478 million (2.95 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010 and the $497 million (3.11 percent of average loans outstanding) in the fourth quarter of 2009.
     The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.81 percent (3.03 percent excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2010, compared with 2.85 percent (3.10 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010, and 2.70 percent (3.04 percent excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2009. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 136 percent (192 percent excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2010, compared with 133 percent (181 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010, and 110 percent (153 percent excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2009.

     Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010, totaled $5,048 million, compared with $5,414 million at September 30, 2010, and $5,907 million at December 31, 2009. Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010, included $1,697 million of assets covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 2.55 percent (1.87 percent excluding covered assets) at December 31, 2010, compared with 2.76 percent (2.02 percent excluding covered assets) at September 30, 2010, and 3.02 percent (2.25 percent excluding covered assets) at December 31, 2009. The decrease in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, compared with a year ago was driven primarily by the construction and land development

portfolios, as well as by improvement in other commercial portfolios. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, to trend lower in the first quarter of 2011.
     Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $2,184 million ($1,094 million excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2010, compared with $2,110 million ($1,165 million excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010, and $2,309 million ($1,525 million excluding covered loans) at December 31, 2009. The increase in restructured loans that continue to accrue interest, compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2010, reflected the impact of loan modifications for certain residential mortgage and consumer credit card customers in light of current economic conditions. The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are having financial difficulties, including those acquired through FDIC-assisted acquisitions, but expects increases in restructured loans to continue to moderate.
     Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders' equity was $29.5 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $29.2 billion at September 30, 2010, and $26.0 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase over the prior year principally reflected corporate earnings, as well as the issuance, net of related discount, of $430 million of perpetual preferred stock in exchange for certain income trust securities in the second quarter of 2010. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.5 percent at December 31, 2010, compared with 10.3 percent at September 30, 2010, and 9.6 percent at December 31, 2009. The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 7.8 percent at December 31, 2010, compared with 7.6 percent at September 30, 2010, and 6.8 percent at December 31, 2009. The tangible common equity ratio was 6.0 percent at December 31, 2010, compared with 6.2 percent at

utilization of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company's diverse customer base. During 2010, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis. Starting with the third quarter of 2010, lines of business results include the impact of transferring the operating activities of the First Bank of Oak Park ("FBOP") acquisition to the appropriate operating segments. Covered commercial and commercial real estate credit-impaired loans and related other real estate owned remain in Treasury and Corporate Support.

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate contributed $172 million of the Company's net income in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $136 million in the third quarter of 2010. Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate's net income increased $115 million over the same quarter of 2009 due to higher total net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $62 million (12.7 percent) year-over-year due to improved spreads on new loans, an increase in loan fees and the impact of the FBOP acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in average total loans and the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Total noninterest income increased $16 million (5.5 percent), mainly due to strong growth in commercial products revenue including standby letters of credit, commercial loan, syndication and other capital markets fees, partially offset by lower commercial leasing revenue. Total noninterest expense increased $57 million (18.9 percent) over a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense and increased litigation costs. The provision for credit losses was $161 million (41.6 percent) lower year-over-year due to a reduction in net charge-offs and a decrease in reserve allocation.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Global and domestic economies could fail to recover from the recent economic downturn or could experience another severe contraction, which could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp's revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a delay or failure of recovery in the residential real estate markets, could cause additional credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp's business and financial performance is likely to be impacted by effects of recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp's results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, residual value risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Corporate Risk Profile" contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.
Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
(MORE)
 
U.S. Bancorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2010 Results January 19, 2011 Page 28
These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders' equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company's calculation of these non-regulatory capital ratios.
