The New Agreement will also be used for future grants of performance restricted stock unit awards, including awards to be made effective February 16, 2011. The New Agreement contains certain technical changes to the form of award agreement previously used. All awards of performance restricted stock units are made pursuant to the shareholder-approved U.S. Bancorp 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, which, as amended and restated, was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 20, 2010. The form of New Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

THIS AGREEMENT
The Company and Participant agree as follows:

Award

The Target Award Number shall be adjusted upward or downward as provided in the Completed Exhibit A. The number of Units that Participant will receive under this Agreement, after giving effect to such adjustment, is referred to herein as the "Final Award Number." Each Unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock, subject to the vesting requirements and distribution provisions of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan. The shares of Common Stock distributable to Participant with respect to the Units granted hereunder are referred to as the "Shares." Participant's Award Summary sets forth the date of grant of this award (the "Grant Date"). The Completed Exhibit A sets forth (a) the performance period over which the Final Award Number will be determined (the "Performance Period"), and (b) the date on which the Final Award Number will be determined (the "Determination Date").
2.
Vesting; Forfeiture
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Units shall vest in installments on the dates set forth in the Participant's Award Summary (each such date, a "Scheduled Vesting Date"), if the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company or an Affiliate of the Company until any such Scheduled Vesting Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, if Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any Affiliate prior to vesting of any Units in accordance with the Award Summary, all of Participant's unvested Units shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited.
Time Based Vesting Conditions
 
(b) . If Participant has a Separation From Service (as defined in Section 11) with the Company or any Affiliate by reason of Disability (as defined in Section 11) or Retirement (as defined in Section 11), the Units shall not be forfeited, but shall continue to vest on the Scheduled Vesting Dates in accordance with Participant's Award Summary as though such Separation From Service had never occurred, so long as the Participant has at all times since the Grant Date complied with the terms of any confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant.
Continued Vesting Upon Separation From Service Due to Retirement or Disability
(c) . If Participant ceases to be an employee by reason of death, or if Participant dies after a Separation From Service with the Company or an Affiliate due to Disability or Retirement but prior to any Scheduled Vesting Date, then the Units will become vested in accordance with this Section 2(c). If such death occurs prior to the last day of the Performance Period, a number of Units equal to the Target Award Number will vest upon Participant's death. If the death occurs on or after the last day of the Performance Period, then a number of Units equal to the Final Award Number will vest upon Participant's death. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such accelerated vesting shall occur only if the Participant has at all times since the Grant Date complied with the terms of any confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant.
Acceleration of Vesting Upon Death
(d) . Notwithstanding the vesting provisions contained in Sections 2(a) through (c) above, but subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, if Participant has been continuously employed by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company until the date of a Qualifying Termination (as defined in Section 11), then immediately upon such Qualifying Termination, Participant shall be vested in the number of Units determined in accordance with this Section 2(d). If the Qualifying Termination occurs prior to the last day of the Performance Period, a number of Units equal to the Target Award Number will vest upon such Qualifying Termination. If the Qualifying Termination occurs on or after the last day of the Performance Period, a number of Units equal to the Final Award Number will vest upon such Qualifying Termination.
Acceleration of Vesting Upon Qualifying Termination
(e) . If Participant violates the terms of any confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant, all of Participant's unvested Units shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited. If Participant's employment with the Company is terminated for Cause (as defined in Section 11), all of Participant's unvested Units shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited. Upon forfeiture, Participant shall have no rights relating to the forfeited Units (including, without limitation, any rights to receive a distribution of Shares with respect to the Units and the right to receive dividend equivalents).

(a) . As soon as administratively feasible following each Scheduled Vesting Date (but in no event later than 60 days following such Scheduled Vesting Date), all Shares issuable pursuant to Units that become vested as of such Scheduled Vesting Date (and with respect to which Shares have not been distributed previously) shall be distributed to Participant, or in the event of Participant's death, to the representatives of Participant or to any Person to whom the Units have been transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
Scheduled Vesting Date Distributions
 
(b) . As soon as administratively feasible following a Separation From Service in connection with a Qualifying Termination (but in no event later than 60 days following such Separation From Service), all Shares issuable pursuant to Units that become vested as a result of such Qualifying Termination (and with respect to which Shares have not been distributed previously) shall be distributed to Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Shares issuable to a Specified Employee (as defined in Section 11) as a result of a Separation From Service in connection with a Qualifying Termination will not be delivered to such Specified Employee until the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation From Service.
Qualifying Termination Distributions
(c) . If a Participant has a Separation From Service with the Company or its Affiliates due to Retirement or Disability (so long as such Separation From Service is not in connection with a Qualifying Termination), the distribution of Shares with respect to Units will not be accelerated, and Shares will be distributed as soon as administratively feasible following the applicable Scheduled Vesting Dates (but in no event later than 60 days following any such Scheduled Vesting Date).
Distributions Following Retirement or Disability
(d) . As soon as administratively feasible following the death of a Participant (but in no event later than 90 days following such death) all Shares issuable pursuant to Units that become vested pursuant to Section 2(c) (and with respect to which Shares have not been distributed previously) shall be distributed to Participant.
Distributions Following Death

Prior to the distribution of Shares with respect to Units pursuant to Section 3, Participant shall not have ownership or rights of ownership of any Shares underlying the Units; , , that cash dividend equivalents shall accrue on the Shares underlying the Units, whether such Units are vested or unvested, if cash dividends are declared by the Company's Board of Directors on the Common Stock on or after the Grant Date. Participant shall be entitled to dividend equivalents with respect to a number of Units equal to the Final Award Number. Such dividend equivalents will be in an amount of cash per Unit equal to the cash dividend paid with respect to a share of outstanding Common Stock. The dividend equivalents shall be treated as earnings on, and as a separate amount from, the Units for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. Dividend equivalents accrued prior to the Determination Date will be paid to Participant as soon as administratively feasible after the Determination Date (but in no event later than 30 days following the Determination Date). After the Determination Date, dividend equivalents will be paid to Participant with respect to unvested Shares on the same payment dates as dividends to holders of the Common Stock are paid; , , that, in all events, any dividend equivalents paid in accordance with this sentence shall be paid in the calendar year in which the dividends are declared, or, if later, on or before the date that is two and one-half months after the date on which such dividends are declared. Dividend equivalents paid with respect to dividends declared before the delivery of the Shares underlying the Units will be treated as compensation income for tax purposes and will be subject to income and payroll tax withholding by the Company.
