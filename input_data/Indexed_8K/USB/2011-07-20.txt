Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1,203 million for the second quarter of 2011, 57.0 percent higher than the $766 million for the second quarter of 2010 and 15.0 percent higher than the $1,046 million for the first quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per common share of $.60 in the second quarter of 2011 were $.15 higher than the second quarter of 2010 and $.08 higher than the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.54 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2011, compared with 1.09 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2010. Several items impacted the comparison of the current quarter's results to prior periods. Diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter of 2010 included a $.05 benefit related to a non-recurring exchange of perpetual preferred stock for outstanding income trust securities. The second quarter of 2010 also included net securities losses of $21 million. Included in the first quarter of 2011 was a $46 million gain related to the acquisition of First Community Bank of New Mexico ("FCB") in a transaction with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") that increased first quarter of 2011 diluted earnings per common share by

approximately $.02. The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2011 was $175 million lower than net charge-offs, as compared with $50 million lower than net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2011 and $25 million in excess of net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2010.
U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "Our second quarter results clearly illustrate our Company's continuing ability to produce solid, repeatable, and high quality earnings in a challenging environment. Diluted earnings per common share of $.60 were 33.3 percent higher than the prior year's quarter and 15.4 percent higher than the prior quarter and were driven by revenue growth and improving credit costs. Our industry-leading performance metrics, including a return on average assets of 1.54 percent, a return on average common equity of 15.9 percent and an efficiency ratio of 51.6 percent, continue to move us closer to our long term normalized targets, demonstrating the through-the-cycle strength of our franchise and business model.
"Our business lines performed well this quarter despite on-going economic headwinds and a very modest demand for new lending. Although average total loans outstanding grew by just .6 percent over the first quarter, commercial and commercial real estate commitments increased significantly year-over-year and linked quarter, positioning us well for the eventual resurgence in demand for credit. Deposit growth in both our consumer and commercial business segments remained strong. Our fee revenue grew linked quarter by 6.7 percent, reflecting strong seasonal trends in payments, deposit service charges and treasury management fees, in addition to growth in commercial products revenue. Importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue growth outpaced the modest increase in noninterest expense. We also achieved positive operating leverage on a linked quarter basis, adjusted for the FCB gain recorded in the first quarter of this year.
"As expected, credit quality continued to improve during the second quarter, as evidenced by favorable trends in net charge-offs, nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. These results, in addition to the expectation that credit quality will continue to improve, particularly in the consumer credit card category, led to a reserve release of $175 million in the current quarter, compared with a $50 million reserve release in the first quarter. Overall, we expect net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to be lower in the third quarter of 2011 and would expect to, once again, release reserves if the current trends and our longer term credit outlook remain positive.
"We continue to generate significant capital each quarter through earnings, and our capital position remains very strong. The Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 capital ratios were 8.4 percent and 11.0 percent,

respectively, at June 30th. Additionally, our Tier 1 common ratio under anticipated Basel III guidelines was 8.1 percent at June 30th. We are awaiting final regulatory guidance as to the amount of capital our Company will be required to hold as a systemically important financial institution ("SIFI"). Regardless of the final amount of buffer assigned, we expect to easily meet the new guidelines through internal capital generation, allowing us to move forward with our long term goal of distributing a majority of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In fact, we began to buy back stock late in the second quarter and expect to continue to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of the year.
"The banking industry continues to face a difficult and increasingly complex environment in which economic uncertainty, regulation and changes in customer and competitor behavior have an impact on how we allocate resources and manage operations, as well as on how we position ourselves for future earnings growth. Customers seek a strong and trusted banking partner and we continue to benefit from a "flight to quality" that is assigned to our franchise. As we move into the second half of 2011, I am especially proud of our Company's performance and, importantly, the many dedicated employees that have faced the challenges presented, navigated the hurdles and continued to produce these exceptional results. I am confident that our strong business model, our adherence to prudent risk policies and our outstanding employee leaders will allow us to continue to invest, innovate, adapt and perform for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders."

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the second quarter of 2011 was $437 million (57.0 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010 and $157 million (15.0 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2011. The increase in net income year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis was principally the result of growth in total net revenue, driven by increases in both net interest income and fee-based revenue, and a lower provision for credit losses. These positive variances were partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense.
Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the second quarter of 2011 was $4,690 million; $171 million (3.8 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010, reflecting a 5.6 percent increase in net interest income and a 1.7 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was largely the result of an increase in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost core deposit fundingNoninterest income increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher payments-related revenue and commercial products revenue, as well as lower net securities losses. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $171 million (3.8 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, due to a 1.5 percent increase in net interest income and a 6.7 percent increase in total noninterest income driven by higher

payments-related revenue, deposit services charges, commercial products revenue and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by the FCB gain recorded in the first quarter of 2011.
Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2011 was $2,425 million; $48 million (2.0 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010 and $111 million (4.8 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2011. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense. The increase in total noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was principally due to higher compensation and marketing and business development expense, as well as other expense, including higher FDIC deposit insurance expense and costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects.
The Company's provision for credit losses declined from a year ago and on a linked quarter basis. The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2011 was $572 million, $183 million lower than the first quarter of 2011 and $567 million lower than the second quarter of 2010. The provision for credit losses was $175 million lower than net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2011. In the first quarter of 2011, the provision for credit losses was $50 million lower than net charge-offs, while in the second quarter of 2010, it exceeded net charge-offs by $25 million. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2011 were $747 million, compared with $805 million in the first quarter of 2011, and $1,114 million in the second quarter of 2010. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to continue to trend lower in the third quarter of 2011.
Nonperforming assets include assets originated by the Company, as well as loans and other real estate acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements ("covered assets") that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. Excluding covered assets, nonperforming assets were $3,262 million at June 30, 2011, $3,479 million at March 31, 2011, and $3,734 million at June 30, 2010. The decline on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis was led by reductions in nonperforming construction and land development assets, as the Company continued to resolve and reduce exposure to these problem assets, in addition to improvement in other commercial portfolios, reflecting the stabilizing economy. However, there is continued stress in the commercial and residential mortgage portfolios, due to the overall duration of the economic slowdown. Covered nonperforming assets were $1,389 million at June 30, 2011, $1,541 million at March 31, 2011, and $2,151 million at June 30, 2010. The majority of the nonperforming covered assets were considered credit-impaired at acquisition and were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered loans, was

2.83 percent at June 30, 2011, compared with 2.97 percent at March 31, 2011, and 3.18 percent at June 30, 2010. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered loans, was 2.66 percent at June 30, 2011, compared with 2.78 percent at March 31, 2011, and 2.89 percent at June 30, 2010The Company expects total nonperforming assets to trend lower in the third quarter of 2011

Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the second quarter of 2011 was $2,544 million, compared with $2,409 million in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of $135 million (5.6 percent). The increase was principally the result of growth in average earning assets and growth in lower cost core deposit funding. Average earning assets were $30.1 billion (12.2 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010, driven by increases of $15.8 billion (33.5 percent) in average investment securities, $7.6 billion (4.0 percent) in average loans and $7.6 billion in average other earning assets, which included cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. Net interest income increased $37 million (1.5 percent) on a linked quarter basis, due to

growth in average earning assets, largely in lower yielding investment securities. The net interest margin was 3.67 percent in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 3.90 percent in the second quarter of 2010, and 3.69 percent in the first quarter of 2011. The decline in the net interest margin year-over-year primarily reflected higher balances in lower yielding investment securities and growth in cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, compared with the second quarter of 2010. On a linked quarter basis, the unfavorable net interest margin impact of the continued growth in lower yielding investment securities was partially offset by a decline in the cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.
 
 
Total average loans were $7.6 billion (4.0 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2011 than the second quarter of 2010, driven by growth in residential mortgages (22.0 percent), total commercial loans (8.0 percent), total commercial real estate loans (3.9 percent) and total retail loans (.7 percent). These increases were partially offset by an 18.4 percent decline in average covered loans. Total average loans, excluding covered loans, were higher by 6.7 percent year-over-year. Total average loans were $1.2 billion (.6 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2011 than the first quarter of 2011, as increases in the majority of loan

categories, including residential mortgages (3.0 percent), total commercial loans (2.8 percent), and total commercial real estate loans (.9 percent) were partially offset by lower covered loans (5.3 percent) and total retail loans (.7 percent). Excluding covered loans, total average loans grew by 1.2 percent on a linked quarter basis. The increases were driven by demand for loans and lines by new and existing credit-worthy borrowers and the impact of the FCB acquisition.
Average investment securities in the second quarter of 2011 were $15.8 billion (33.5 percent) higher year-over-year and $6.6 billion (11.6 percent) higher than the prior quarter. The increases over the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency-backed securities, as the Company continued to move liquidity on-balance sheet.
 
 
Average total deposits for the second quarter of 2011 were $26.1 billion (14.2 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $8.8 billion (22.1 percent) year-over-year, largely due to growth in Wholesale Banking and Consumer and Small Business Banking average balances. Average total savings deposits were $15.1 billion (15.1 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in corporate trust balances, including the impact of the December 30, 2010, acquisition of the securitization trust administration business of Bank of America, N.A. ("securitization trust acquisition"), and Consumer and Small Business Banking average balances. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were $1.6 billion (9.5 percent) lower year-over-year, reflecting maturities and fewer renewals given the current

rate environment. Time deposits greater than $100,000 increased by $3.8 billion (14.4 percent), principally due to higher average balances in Wholesale Banking and the positive impact from the securitization trust and FCB acquisitions.
Average total deposits increased $5.1 billion (2.5 percent) over the first quarter of 2011. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $4.5 billion (10.3 percent) with average balance increases across a majority of the business lines. Total average savings deposits increased $1.2 billion (1.1 percent) on a linked quarter basis due to higher Consumer and Small Business Banking and institutional and corporate trust balances, partially offset by a decline in Wholesale Banking balances. Average time deposits less than $100,000 remained relatively flat. Average time deposits over $100,000 were $.8 billion (2.5 percent) lower on a linked quarter basis, reflecting maturities and wholesale funding decisions.
 
 
Noninterest Income
Second quarter noninterest income was $2,146 million; $36 million (1.7 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2010 and $134 million (6.7 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, noninterest income benefited from payments-related revenues, which were $45 million (5.9 percent) higher, largely due to increased transaction volumes, and a $13 million (6.3 percent) increase in commercial products revenue, attributable to higher standby letters of credit fees, commercial loan fees and commercial

leasing revenue. ATM processing services income increased $6 million (5.6 percent) and investment products fees and commissions increased $5 million (16.7 percent) due to business initiatives, and securities gains (losses) improved by $13 million (61.9 percent). In addition, other income increased $5 million (2.9 percent) as higher retail lease residual valuation income was partially offset by a gain related to the Company's investment in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) ("Visa Gain") in the second quarter of 2010. Offsetting these positive variances was a decrease in deposit service charges of $37 million (18.6 percent), as the result of Company-initiated and regulatory revisions to overdraft fee policies, partially offset by core account growth. Trust and investment management fees decreased $9 million (3.4 percent), primarily due to the transfer of the long-term asset management business to Nuveen Investments in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decline was partially offset by the positive impact of the securitization trust acquisition and improved market conditions.
Noninterest income was $134 million (6.7 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2011 than the first quarter of 2011. Payments-related revenue increased $66 million (8.9 percent), primarily driven by higher transaction volumes Deposit service charges and treasury management fees increased $19 million (13.3 percent) and $7 million (5.1 percent), respectively, on a linked quarter basis principally due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Commercial products revenue was $27 million (14.1 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2011, largely due to higher syndication and other capital markets fees. Mortgage banking revenue increased $40 million (20.1 percent), due to a higher net valuation of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") and higher origination and sales and servicing revenue. Other income was lower by $29 million (14.2 percent) on a linked quarter basis principally due to the FCB gain in the first quarter of 2011, partially offset by higher customer-related derivative revenue and retail lease residual valuation income.

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2011 totaled $2,425 million, an increase of $48 million (2.0 percent) over the second quarter of 2010, and a $111 million (4.8 percent) increase over the first quarter of 2011. The increase in noninterest expense over the same quarter of last year was principally due to increased compensation, employee benefits and net occupancy and equipment expense, partially offset by a decrease in other expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased over the prior year by $58 million (6.1 percent) and $38 million (22.1 percent), respectively. Compensation expense increased primarily because of branch expansion and other business initiatives and merit increases. Employee benefits expense increased due to higher pension and medical costs and the impact of additional staff. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $23 million (10.2 percent) year-over-year largely due to business expansion and technology initiatives. Professional services expense was $9 million (12.3 percent) higher year-over-year, due to technology-related and other projects across multiple business lines. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other intangibles expense of $16 million (17.6 percent), compared with the prior year, due to the reduction or completion of the amortization of certain intangibles. Other expense was lower by $72 million (13.8 percent), due in part to debt extinguishment costs recorded in the second quarter of 2010 for the exchange of the income trust securities. In addition, costs related to mortgage servicing, other real estate owned, acquisition integration, insurance and litigation matters and investments in

affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects were lower year-over-year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense.
Noninterest expense was $111 million (4.8 percent) higher than the seasonally low first quarter of 2011. Compensation expense increased $45 million (4.7 percent), principally due to additions to staff, annual merit increases and higher incentives related to the Company's improved financial results. Professional services and marketing and business development expenses were higher on a linked quarter basis by $12 million (17.1 percent) and $25 million (38.5 percent), respectively, due to the timing of payments-related initiatives and additional costs related to product promotions, higher legal costs and a contribution to the Company's charitable foundation. In addition, other expense was $43 million (10.6 percent) higher, primarily due to higher costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects, FDIC deposit insurance and litigation and other insurance matters. These increases were partially offset by a $20 million (8.7 percent) reduction in employee benefits expense primarily due to seasonally lower employee payroll taxes.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2011 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 30.4 percent (effective tax rate of 28.0 percent), compared with 25.0 percent (effective tax rate of 20.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2010 and 29.0 percent (effective tax rate of 26.2 percent) in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflected the marginal impact of higher pretax earnings.

Credit Quality
Net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis as economic conditions stabilized. The allowance for credit losses was $5,308 million at June 30, 2011, compared with $5,498 million at March 31, 2011, and $5,536 million at June 30, 2010. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2011 were $747 million, compared with $805 million in the first quarter of 2011, and $1,114 million in the second quarter of 2010. The decrease in total net charge-offs was principally due to improvement in the commercial lending, credit card, residential mortgage and other retail portfolios, partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate charge-offs, compared with the first quarter of 2011. The Company recorded $572 million of provision for credit losses, $175 million less than net charge-offs, during the second quarter of 2011. The allowance for credit losses reimbursable by the FDIC was lower than the prior quarter by $15 million.
Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs decreased to $260 million in the second quarter of 2011 (1.22 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $264 million (1.28 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2011 and $472 million (2.35 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010. The decrease primarily reflected improvement in the commercial lending portfolio, partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate charge-offs.
Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs decreased to $119 million (1.46 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $129 million (1.65 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2011 and $138 million (2.06 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010. Total retail loan net charge-offs were $363 million (2.28 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011, lower than the $410 million (2.59 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2011 and the $499 million (3.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2010.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.66 percent (2.83 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011, compared with 2.78 percent (2.97 percent excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2011, and 2.89 percent (3.18 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2010. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 140 percent (188 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011, compared with 133 percent (180 percent excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2011, and 120 percent (168 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2010.

Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2011, totaled $4,651 million, compared with $5,020 million at March 31, 2011, and $5,885 million at June 30, 2010. Total nonperforming assets at June 30, 2011, included $1,389 million of assets covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 2.32 percent (1.77 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2011, compared with 2.52 percent (1.92 percent excluding covered assets) at March 31, 2011, and 3.05 percent (2.17 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2010. The decrease in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, compared with a year ago was driven primarily by the construction and land development portfolios, as well as by

improvement in other commercial portfolios. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects nonperforming assets to trend lower in the third quarter of 2011.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $1,732 million ($804 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011, compared with $1,954 million ($949 million excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2011, and $2,221 million ($1,239 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2010. Restructured loans that continue to accrue interest increased compared with the first quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to the impact of loan modifications for certain real estate-related customers in light of current economic conditions. The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are having financial difficulties, including those acquired through FDIC-assisted acquisitions.
 
 
Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders' equity was $32.5 billion at June 30, 2011, compared with $30.5 billion at March 31, 2011, and $28.2 billion at June 30, 2010.The Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0 percent at June 30, 2011, compared with 10.8 percent at March 31, 2011, and 10.1 percent at June 30, 2010.

Lines of Business
The Company's major lines of business are Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, Consumer and Small Business Banking, Wealth Management and Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate contributed $265 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $96 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $208 million in the first quarter of 2011. Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate's net income increased $169 million over the same quarter of 2010 due to higher total net revenue and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $35 million (7.1 percent) year-over-year primarily due to higher average loan and deposit balances and an increase in loan fees, partially offset by the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Total noninterest income increased $43 million (15.2 percent), mainly due to growth in commercial products revenue, including syndication and other capital markets fees, commercial leasing, foreign exchange and international trade revenue, and commercial loan and standby letters of credit fees. In addition, other revenue increased primarily due to higher equity investment revenue and improved investment-grade bond income. Total noninterest expense increased $24 million (7.9 percent) over a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense, FDIC deposit insurance expense and net shared services, partially offset by lower costs on other real estate owned. The provision for credit losses was $204 million (63.9 percent) lower year-over-year due to a reduction in net charge-offs.
Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate
Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate's contribution to net income in the second quarter of 2011 was $53 million (25.5 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2011.

Total net revenue was higher by $49 million (6.1 percent). Net interest income was $16 million (3.1 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, principally due to higher loans fees and average deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of declining rates on the margin benefit from deposits.

Retail banking's total net revenue was 3.1 percent higher, compared with the second quarter of 2010, as an increase in net interest income was partially offset by a decline in total noninterest income. Net interest income increased 5.6 percent primarily due to higher loan and deposit volumes and an increase in loan fees, partially offset by the impact of lower rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Total noninterest income for the retail banking division decreased 2.0 percent from a year ago due to a reduction in deposit service charges, reflecting the impact of Company-initiated and regulatory revisions to overdraft fee policies, partially offset by core account growth and pricing changes. Total noninterest expense for the retail banking division in the second quarter of 2011 was 5.3 percent higher year-over-year, principally due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense, an increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense, higher net shared services costs and net occupancy and equipment expense related to business initiatives, partially offset by lower other intangibles expense and litigation costs. The provision for credit losses for the retail banking division decreased 17.2 percent on a year-over-year basis due to lower net charge-offs and a reduction in the reserve allocation.

Total noninterest expense for the retail banking division increased 2.9 percent on a linked quarter basis due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense and increased net occupancy and equipment expense due to business initiatives. The provision for credit losses for the division decreased 6.7 percent due to a decrease in the reserve allocation, partially offset by higher commercial and commercial real estate net charge-offs.

Net interest income was higher by $8 million (10.3 percent), primarily due to higher average deposit balances, including the impact of the securitization trust acquisition. Total noninterest income decreased by $6 million (2.2 percent), compared with the second quarter of 2010.

Additionally, there was an increase in investment products fees and commissions due to increased sales volumes. Total noninterest expense increased by $32 million (12.4 percent), due to higher compensation and employee benefits and net shared services expense and the impact of the securitization trust acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in other intangibles expense and expenses related to the transfer to Nuveen Investments.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Global and domestic economies could fail to recover from the recent economic downturn or could experience another severe contraction, which could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp's revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Continued stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a delay or failure of recovery in the residential real estate markets, could cause additional credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp's business and financial performance is likely to be impacted by effects of recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp's results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, residual value risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Corporate Risk Profile" contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company's calculation of these measures.
