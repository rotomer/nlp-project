Additional information with respect to the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenants is summarized in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 28, 2011, and the Companys Current Report on Form 8 K, filed with the SEC on June 3, 2011. The Companys 5.875% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2035 underlying the Trust Preferred Securities (the "5.875% Debentures") are currently designated as the covered debt under each of the Replacement Capital Covenants. As a result of the Companys redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities and the underlying 5.875% Debentures, the 5.875% Debentures ceased being the covered debt under each Replacement Capital Covenant, effective as of September 8, 2011.
