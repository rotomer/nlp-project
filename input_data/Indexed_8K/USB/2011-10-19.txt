 U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported net income of $1,273 million for the third quarter of 2011, or $.64 per diluted common share.

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1,273 million for the third quarter of 2011, 40.2 percent higher than the $908 million for the third quarter of 2010 and 5.8 percent higher than the $1,203 million for the second quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per common share of $.64 in the third quarter of 2011 were $.19 higher than the third quarter of 2010 and $.04 higher than the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.57 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2011, compared with 1.26 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2010. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2011 was $150 million lower than net charge-offs, compared with a provision for credit losses that was $175 million lower than net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2011 and equal to net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2010.
U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "I am exceptionally proud of our third quarter results, as our Company was able to achieve record earnings in what many would describe as a difficult and uncertain economic environment. The results were driven by record total net revenue and lower credit costs, as well as managed expense levels. Total net revenue benefited from both our balance sheet and fee-based businesses and, coupled with our prudent expense management, led to positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Once again, we achieved industry-leading profitability metrics with a return on average assets of 1.57 percent and a return on average common equity of 16.1 percent.
"Contributing to the results was notable growth in both loans and deposits, as we continued to benefit from the investments we have made in our business lines and the overall flight to quality. Average total loans grew by 5.0 percent year-over-year and 1.7 percent over the previous quarter. Additionally, commercial and commercial real estate commitments grew at a faster pace; 16.8 percent year-over-year and 5.8 percent over the prior quarter, positioning us well for future loan growth as the economy improves and our customers' full confidence returns. Deposit growth was exceptionally strong on both the consumer and wholesale sides of the business this quarter, with noninterest bearing deposits growing by more than 47 percent year-over-year and 20 percent over the prior quarter. Significantly, recently published FDIC market share data indicates that our Company grew deposits by 15.8 percent between June 30, 2010, and June 30, 2011, while the total U.S. market grew by 6.8 percent, confirming that we have, in fact, increased our overall deposit market share.
"As expected, credit quality continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined by over 10 percent, while nonperforming assets fell by nearly 7 percent in the third quarter versus the prior quarter. The improvement

led to a reserve release of $150 million in the third quarter, slightly lower than the previous quarter, as the outlook for charge-offs in a number of the consumer loan categories is stabilizing. We expect both net charge-offs and nonperforming asset levels to improve in the fourth quarter.
"Our capital position remains strong with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 8.5 percent and Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8 percent at September 30th. Importantly, using anticipated Basel III guidelines, our Tier 1 common ratio was 8.2 percent at quarter end. Given the strength of our capital position and on-going ability to generate significant capital each quarter through earnings, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares of stock during the third quarter. At this point, we have not received final regulatory guidance regarding the amount of capital our Company will be expected to hold as a systematically important financial institution ("SIFI"). However, we expect that the strength of our current capital position and earnings will allow us to comply with the guideline, while continuing to buy back additional shares in the upcoming quarters, bringing us closer to our long term goal of returning 60 to 80 percent of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
"We are a bank, and our ultimate success is tied to the health, financial well-being and sentiment of our customers, both large and small, as well as the economic environment in which we operate. Likewise, a vibrant and growing economy is directly tied to the health and strength of the banking industry. Consequently, we are all managing through this challenging time together and, as our results show, we are striving very hard to do our part. We have more branches, more employees, more customers, more loans, and more deposits than we had at the beginning of 2007 and, in fact, more than just one year ago, and we fully expect this trend to continue. Our success, past and present, is a direct result of our employees' dedication and focus, and I am proud of their efforts and thankful for their many contributions. They have earned our customers' trust  a vital factor for our continued success. We are providing our commercial, institutional and consumer customers with the financial products, services and trusted banking partnership that they need to succeed, while prudently managing a company that is profitable, growing, investing and focusing on the future, all for the benefit of our customers, employees, communities and shareholders."

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the third quarter of 2011 was $365 million (40.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010 and $70 million (5.8 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011. The increase in net income year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis was principally the result of growth in total net revenue, driven by increases in both net interest income and fee-based revenue, and a lower provision for credit losses. These positive variances were partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense.
Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2011 was $4,795 million; $208 million (4.5 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010, reflecting a 5.9 percent increase in net interest income and a 2.9 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was largely the result of an increase in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding. Noninterest income increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher payments-related revenue, deposit services charges and commercial products revenue. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $105 million (2.2 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, due to a 3.1 percent increase in net interest income and a 1.2 percent increase in total noninterest income, driven by higher payments-related revenue and deposit services charges.

Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2011 was $2,476 million; $91 million (3.8 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010 and $51 million (2.1 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to higher compensation expense, employee benefits costs, professional services expense and other business initiatives. The increase in total noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was driven by increased compensation expense, professional services expense and marketing and business development expense.
The Company's provision for credit losses declined from a year ago and on a linked quarter basis. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2011 was $519 million, $53 million lower than the second quarter of 2011 and $476 million lower than the third quarter of 2010. The provision for credit losses was $150 million lower than net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2011. In the second quarter of 2011, the provision for credit losses was $175 million lower than net charge-offs, while it was equal to net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2010. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2011 were $669 million, compared with $747 million in the second quarter of 2011, and $995 million in the third quarter of 2010. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to continue to trend lower in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Nonperforming assets include assets originated by the Company, as well as loans and other real estate acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements ("covered assets") that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. Excluding covered assets, nonperforming assets were $3,036 million at September 30, 2011, $3,262 million at June 30, 2011, and $3,563 million at September 30, 2010. The decline on a year-over-year basis was led by a reduction in nonperforming assets in commercial portfolios. In addition, there was improvement in construction and development assets, as the Company continued to resolve and reduce exposure to these problem assets. On a linked quarter basis, there was improvement in all portfolios, reflecting the stabilizing economy. While showing improvement on a linked quarter basis, there continues to be stress in the residential mortgage portfolio due to the decline in home values. Covered nonperforming assets were $1,303 million at September 30, 2011, $1,389 million at June 30, 2011, and $1,851 million at September 30, 2010. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered loans, was 2.66 percent at September 30, 2011, compared with 2.83 percent at June 30, 2011, and 3.10 percent at September 30, 2010. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered loans, was 2.53 percent at September 30, 2011, compared with 2.66 percent at June 30, 2011, and

Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the third quarter of 2011 was $2,624 million, compared with $2,477 million in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of $147 million (5.9 percent). The increase was principally the result of growth in average earning assets and growth in lower cost core deposit funding. Average earning assets were $34.4 billion (13.6 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010, driven by increases of $18.4 billion (38.4 percent) in average investment securities, $9.6 billion (5.0 percent) in average loans and $8.9 billion in average other earning assets, which included cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. Net interest income increased $80 million (3.1 percent) on a linked quarter basis, due to growth in average earning assets, principally lower yielding investment securities and average loans. The net interest margin was 3.65 percent in the third quarter of 2011, compared with 3.91 percent in the third

quarter of 2010, and 3.67 percent in the second quarter of 2011. The decline in the net interest margin year-over-year reflected higher balances in lower yielding investment securities and growth in cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, compared with the third quarter of 2010. On a linked quarter basis, the decline in net interest margin reflected the impact of the continued growth in lower yielding investment securities.
 
 
Total average loans were $9.6 billion (5.0 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2011 than the third quarter of 2010, driven by growth in residential mortgages (22.0 percent), total commercial loans (11.9 percent), total commercial real estate loans (4.0 percent), and total other retail loans (1.1 percent). These increases were partially offset by declines in credit card balances (2.7 percent) and in covered loans (18.2 percent). Total average loans, excluding covered loans, were higher by 7.6 percent year-over-year. Total average loans were $3.4 billion (1.7 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2011 than the second quarter of 2011, with increases in a majority of loan categories, including total commercial loans (4.6 percent), residential mortgages (3.9 percent), commercial mortgages (1.9 percent), credit cards (1.1 percent), and total other retail loans (.9 percent). Excluding covered loans, total average loans grew by 2.3 percent on a linked

quarter basis. The increases were driven by demand for loans and lines by new and existing credit-worthy borrowers.
Average investment securities in the third quarter of 2011 were $18.4 billion (38.4 percent) higher year-over-year and $3.3 billion (5.2 percent) higher than the prior quarter. The increases over the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency-backed securities, as the Company continued to move liquidity on-balance sheet.
 
 
Average total deposits for the third quarter of 2011 were $32.7 billion (17.9 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $18.9 billion (47.5 percent) year-over-year, with growth in average balances in a majority of the lines of business including, Wholesale Banking, Wealth Management and Securities Services and Consumer and Small Business Banking. Average total savings deposits were $13.4 billion (13.5 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in corporate and institutional trust balances, including the impact of the December 30, 2010, acquisition of the securitization trust administration business of Bank of America, N.A. ("securitization trust administration acquisition"), as well as an increase in Consumer and Small Business Banking average balances, partially offset by lower broker-dealer average balances. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were $.8 billion (4.8 percent) lower year-over-year, reflecting maturities and fewer renewals given the current rate environment. Time deposits greater than $100,000 increased by $1.2 billion (4.4 percent), principally due to higher

average balances in Wholesale Banking and the impact of the securitization trust administration acquisition and the first quarter of 2011 acquisition of First Community Bank of New Mexico ("FCB").
Average total deposits increased $6.0 billion (2.8 percent) over the second quarter of 2011. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $9.9 billion (20.3 percent) principally due to higher Wholesale Banking and corporate trust average balances. Total average savings deposits decreased $2.2 billion (1.9 percent) on a linked quarter basis as lower institutional trust average balances were partially offset by higher Consumer and Small Business Banking balances. Average time deposits less than $100,000 remained relatively unchanged, while average time deposits over $100,000 were $1.6 billion (5.4 percent) lower on a linked quarter basis, reflecting maturities and wholesale funding decisions.
 
 
Noninterest Income
Third quarter noninterest income was $2,171 million; $61 million (2.9 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2010 and $25 million (1.2 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011. Year-over-year, noninterest income benefited from a $47 million (6.0 percent) increase in payments-related revenue and a $10 million (9.5 percent) increase in ATM processing services income, largely due to increased transaction volumes. Deposit services charges increased $23 million (14.4 percent) primarily due to new account
growth, higher transaction volumes and recent product redesign initiatives, partially offset by the impact of

2010 legislative and pricing changes. Commercial products revenue was $15 million (7.6 percent) higher, attributable to higher commercial leasing revenue, syndication fees and other commercial loan fees. In addition, other income increased $55 million (42.0 percent) primarily due to higher retail lease residual revenue and customer-related derivative revenue. Offsetting these positive variances was a decrease in trust and investment management fees of $26 million (9.7 percent), primarily due to the sale of the long-term asset management business to Nuveen Investments in the fourth quarter of 2010 and money market investment fee waivers. The decline was partially offset by the positive impact of the securitization trust administration acquisition and improved market conditions. Mortgage banking revenue was $65 million (21.0 percent) lower than the third quarter of last year, as a result of lower origination and sales revenue.
Noninterest income was $25 million (1.2 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2011 than the second quarter of 2011. Payments-related revenue increased $21 million (2.6 percent), primarily driven by seasonally higher transaction volumes in corporate payment products. Deposit service charges increased $21 million (13.0 percent) on a linked quarter basis principally due to higher transaction volumes and product redesign initiatives. Other income was higher by $11 million (6.3 percent) on a linked quarter basis due to increases in equity investment income, retail lease residual revenue and income from sales of investments in tax-advantaged projects, partially offset by lower customer-related derivative revenue. Offsetting these increases was a $17 million (6.6 percent) decrease in trust and investment management fees due principally to the impact of market conditions on account-level fees and money market investment fees waivers.

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2011 totaled $2,476 million, an increase of $91 million (3.8 percent) over the third quarter of 2010, and a $51 million (2.1 percent) increase over the second quarter of 2011. The increase in noninterest expense over the same quarter of last year was principally due to increased compensation, employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment expense and professional services expense, partially offset by decreases in other intangibles expense and other expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased over the prior year by $48 million (4.9 percent) and $32 million (18.7 percent), respectively. Compensation expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in staffing related to branch expansion and other business initiatives, in addition to merit increases. Employee benefits expense increased due to higher pension costs and the impact of additional staff. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased by $23 million (10.0 percent) year-over-year largely due to business expansion and technology initiatives. Professional services expense was $22 million (28.2 percent) higher year-over-year due to mortgage servicing-related projects. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other intangibles expense of $15 million (16.7 percent) due to the reduction or completion of the amortization of certain intangibles. Other expense was lower year-over-year by $18 million (3.8 percent), due to lower costs related to other real estate owned, insurance and litigation matters, partially offset by an increase in costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects.

Noninterest expense was $51 million (2.1 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011. Compensation expense increased $17 million (1.7 percent), principally due to additions to staff and higher incentives related to the Company's improved financial results. Professional services expense was higher on a linked quarter basis by $18 million (22.0 percent) as a result of mortgage servicing-related projects, while marketing and business development expense was higher by $12 million (13.3 percent) due to the timing of payments-related initiatives and an increase in the contribution to the Company's charitable foundation. In addition, other expense was $8 million (1.8 percent) more than the previous quarter, as higher costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects were partially offset by lower FDIC deposit insurance expense.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2011 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 30.4 percent (effective tax rate of 28.1 percent), compared with 25.9 percent (effective tax rate of 22.5 percent) in the third quarter of 2010 and 30.4 percent (effective tax rate of 28.0 percent) in the second quarter of 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate year-over-year primarily reflected the marginal impact of higher pretax earnings.

compared with $5,308 million at June 30, 2011, and $5,540 million at September 30, 2010. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2011 were $669 million, compared with $747 million in the second quarter of 2011, and $995 million in the third quarter of 2010. The decrease in total net charge-offs was principally due to improvement in the commercial real estate, credit card and other retail portfolios, compared with the second quarter of 2011. The Company recorded $519 million of provision for credit losses, $150 million less than net charge-offs, during the third quarter of 2011. The allowance for credit losses reimbursable by the FDIC was higher than the prior quarter by $32 million.
Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs decreased to $224 million in the third quarter of 2011 (1.01 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $260 million (1.22 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011 and $378 million (1.85 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010. The decrease primarily reflected efforts to resolve and reduce exposure to problem assets in the construction and development portfolio.
Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs remained relatively stable at $122 million (1.42 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $119 million (1.46 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011 and $132 million (1.88 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010. Credit card loan net charge-offs decreased to $178 million (4.40 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $216 million (5.45 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011 and $296 million (7.11 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010. Total other retail loan net charge-offs were $142 million (1.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2011, lower than the $147 million (1.23 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011 and the $182 million (1.51 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2010.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.53 percent (2.66 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2011, compared with 2.66 percent (2.83 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011, and 2.85 percent (3.10 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 145 percent (196 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2011, compared with 140 percent (188 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011, and 133 percent (181 percent excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010.

Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2011, totaled $4,339 million, compared with $4,651 million at June 30, 2011, and $5,414 million at September 30, 2010. Total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2011, included $1,303 million of assets covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 2.11 percent (1.60 percent excluding covered assets) at September 30, 2011, compared

with 2.32 percent (1.77 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2011, and 2.76 percent (2.02 percent excluding covered assets) at September 30, 2010. The decrease in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, compared with a year ago was driven primarily by the construction and development portfolios, as well as by improvement in other commercial and retail portfolios. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects nonperforming assets to trend lower in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $1,606 million ($814 million excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2011, compared with $1,732 million ($804 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011, and $2,110 million ($1,165 million excluding covered loans) at September 30, 2010. Performing restructured loans, excluding GNMA and covered loans, increased $563 million compared with June 30, 2011, and $915 million compared with September 30, 2010, principally due to the impact of new accounting guidance adopted in the current quarter.
 
 
Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders' equity was $33.2 billion at September 30, 2011, compared with $32.5 billion at June 30, 2011, and $29.2 billion at September 30, 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 13 million shares of common stock under a 50 million share repurchase authorization announced March 18, 2011. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8 percent at September 30, 2011, compared with 11.0 percent at June 30, 2011, and 10.3 percent at September 30, 2010. The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.5 percent at September 30, 2011, compared with 8.4 percent at June 30, 2011, and 7.6 percent at September 30, 2010. The tangible common equity ratio was 6.6 percent at September 30, 2011, compared with 6.5 percent at June 30, 2011, and 6.2 percent at September 30, 2010.

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate contributed $304 million of the Company's net income in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $144 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $269 million in the second quarter of 2011.

Net interest income increased $26 million (5.0 percent) year-over-year primarily due to higher average loan and deposit balances and an increase in loan fees. Total noninterest income increased $43 million (15.6 percent), mainly due to growth in commercial products revenue, including syndication fees, commercial leasing revenue and commercial loan fees. In addition, other revenue increased primarily due to higher equity investment revenue and customer-related derivative revenue. Total noninterest expense increased $12 million (3.9 percent) over a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense and net shared services expense. The provision for credit losses was $198 million (75.3 percent) lower year-over-year due to a reduction in net charge-offs and a reduction in the reserve allocation.

Total noninterest expense for the retail banking division in the third quarter of 2011 was 3.0 percent higher year-over-year, principally due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense, higher net shared services costs and net occupancy and equipment expense related to business initiatives, partially offset by lower other intangibles expense.

The contribution of the mortgage banking division decreased 40.3 percent from the third quarter of 2010. The division's 18.4 percent decrease in total net revenue was driven by a 14.8 percent reduction in net interest income due to a decrease in average loans held-for-sale and a 20.4 percent decline in total noninterest income due to lower mortgage origination and sales revenue.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Global and domestic economies could fail to recover from the recent economic downturn or could experience another severe contraction, which could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp's revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Continued stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a delay or failure of recovery in the residential real estate markets, could cause additional credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp's business and financial performance is likely to be negatively impacted by effects of recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp's results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, residual value risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Corporate Risk Profile" contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.

These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in Generally Accepted Accounting Principals ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company's calculation of these measures.
