Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Changes in Fiscal Year.
On January 19, 2012, U.S. Bancorp, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), filed a Certificate of Designations for the purpose of amending its Certificate of Incorporation to fix the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of its Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share and a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). A copy of the Certificate of Designations is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On January 23, 2012, the Company closed the sale of 44,000,000 Depositary Shares, with each Depositary Share representing ownership of 1/1,000
th
of a share of the Company's Preferred Stock, which were registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-173636) which was automatically effective on April 21, 2011 (the "Registration Statement"). The following documents are being filed with this report on Form 8-K and shall be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement: (i) Underwriting Agreement dated January 18, 2012, among the Company and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., as representatives of the underwriters, which incorporates by reference the U.S. Bancorp Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (Preferred Stock, Which May Be Represented by Depositary Shares) (January 18, 2012); (ii) Certificate of Designations of the Company dated January 19, 2012; (iii) Deposit Agreement dated January 23, 2012 between U.S. Bancorp and U.S. Bank National Association and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts described therein; (iv) form of Depositary Receipt; and (v) validity opinion with respect to the Depositary Shares and the Preferred Stock.
On January 23, 2012, the Company submitted redemption notices to the property trustee for each trust listed below, which will result in the redemption of the trust preferred securities identified below on the redemption date specified for each security. The trust preferred securities will be redeemed at the redemption price of $25 per trust preferred security plus accrued and unpaid distributions through the redemption date. The USB Capital VIII trust preferred securities have been callable at any time on or after December 29, 2010, and the USB Capital X trust preferred securities have been callable at any time on or after April 12, 2011. Under applicable regulatory capital guidelines issued by bank regulatory agencies, upon notice of redemption, these trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital for the Company. These redemptions are consistent with the capital plan the Company submitted to the Federal Reserve Board, and will be funded by proceeds from the sale of Depositary Shares described above.

aggregate number of Firm Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 10 shares). The total number of Offered Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Underwriting Agreement plus the aggregate number of Optional Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
Payment for the Securities shall be made in federal (same day) funds at the time, date and place set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, upon delivery to the Representatives, through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Securities.

(d) The Company will make generally available to its security holders (as defined in Rule 158) as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the close of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year and 90 days after the close of each fiscal year, earnings statements (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act) covering a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158) with respect to each sale of Securities;
 
(e) The Company will deliver to the Representatives, without charge, as many signed and conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) as the Representatives may reasonably request; and the copies of the Original Registration Statement and each amendment thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. The Company will furnish to the Representatives as many copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as the Representatives shall reasonably request so long as the Underwriters are required to deliver a Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, a notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) in connection with the offering or sale of the Offered Securities; and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T;
(f) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Representatives, to qualify the Offered Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Representatives may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Offered Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been qualified as above provided;
(g) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;

make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus after the date of the Underwriting Agreement relating to such Offered Securities and prior to any Closing Date for such Offered Securities which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Offered Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; and
(m) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information (or any amendment to the Registration Statement), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement), the General Disclosure Package or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished to the Company by the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement), the General Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Representatives as aforesaid) if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Indemnified Person), as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished by the Representatives as aforesaid), to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors or trustees, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Article VIII, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement), the General Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement

(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances; provided, however, that when more than one of the Underwriters is an indemnified party each such Underwriter shall be entitled to separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in each such jurisdiction to the extent such Underwriter may have interests conflicting with those of the other Underwriter or Underwriters because of the participation of one Underwriter in a transaction hereunder in which the other Underwriter or Underwriters did not participate. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Article VIII is for any reason held to be unavailable to the Underwriters in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to Securities sold to the Underwriters in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in such proportion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by the Underwriters to the date of such liability bears to the total sales price (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Offered Securities made to the Underwriters to the date of such liability, and the Company are responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the Underwriters failed to give the notice required under (c), then the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Representatives and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
 
omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were determined pro rata (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph that were offered and sold to the public through the Underwriters exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled under this paragraph to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Article VIII, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Article VIII hereof and the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement or in any certificate submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by any Underwriter or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company or each of their respective directors or trustees or each of their officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of any payment for any of the Offered Securities, if any.
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Offered Securities, which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Offered Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Offered Securities then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Offered Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Offered Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriters" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Article X with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Offered Securities.
 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Offered Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Offered Securities then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the Offered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Offered Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Offered Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in the first paragraph of this Article X, the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Offered Securities or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in the immediately preceding paragraph to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Offered Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriters, the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Article XI hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Article VIII hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and to dealers and any costs associated with electronic delivery of any of the foregoing by the Underwriters to investors; (ii) the cost of printing this Agreement and any Blue Sky and legal investment memoranda; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Offered Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Article VI hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with such qualification and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky memorandum or any Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing stock certificates and Depositary Receipts; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Depositary and any agent of the Depositary and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Depositary in connection with the Deposit Agreement and the Depositary Shares if any Depositary Shares are to be issued; (vii) the fees and expenses incident to any Overallotment Options which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this
 
Article XI; (viii) the costs and expenses (including without limitation any damages or other amounts payable in connection with legal or contractual liability) associated with the reforming of any contracts for sale of the Offered Securities made by the Underwriters caused by a breach of the representation contained in the fourth paragraph of Article VII(c); (x) the filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, securing any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the terms of the sale of the Securities and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Article XI. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Article XI and Articles VIII and XII hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Offered Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
If the Underwriting Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement except pursuant to Article X hereof, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated the Underwriting Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with the Offered Securities.
In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Offered Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose hereunder.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the principal offices of the Representatives and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, Attention: Treasurer; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Article VIII hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Underwriters' Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.

The definitive Receipts shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A annexed to this Agreement, with appropriate insertions, modifications and omissions, as hereinafter provided and shall be engraved or otherwise prepared so as to comply with applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.

Title to Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt which is properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; provided, however, that until transfer of any particular Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.3, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, treat the Record Holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or to any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
Section 2.2. Deposit of Series F Preferred Stock; Execution and Delivery of Receipts in Respect Thereof.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Corporation may from time to time deposit shares of Series F Preferred Stock under this Deposit Agreement by delivery to the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for such shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be deposited, properly endorsed or accompanied, if required by the Depositary, by a duly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, in form satisfactory to the Depositary, together

Each Officer's Certificate delivered to the Depositary in accordance with the terms of this Deposit Agreement shall be deemed to be incorporated into this Deposit Agreement and shall be binding on the Corporation, the Depositary and the Holders of Receipts to which such Officer's Certificate relates.
The Series F Preferred Stock that is deposited shall be held by the Depositary at the Depositary's Office or at such other place or places as the Depositary shall determine. The Depositary shall not lend any Series F Preferred Stock deposited hereunder.
Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Series F Preferred Stock deposited in accordance with the provisions of this Section, together with the other documents required as above specified, and upon recordation of the Series F Preferred Stock on the books of the Corporation (or its duly appointed transfer agent) in the name of the Depositary or its nominee, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to or upon the order of the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section, a Receipt or Receipts evidencing in the aggregate the number of Depositary Shares representing the Series F Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons.

Delivery at other offices shall be at the risk and expense of the person requesting such delivery.
Section 2.3. Registration of Transfer of Receipts.

Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as it may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denomination or denominations requested, evidencing the aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered, and shall deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the Holder of the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered.
 
Any Holder of a Receipt or Receipts may withdraw the number of whole shares of Series F Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals. Thereafter, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such Holder, or to the person or persons designated by such Holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of Series F Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but Holders of such whole shares of Series F Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Series F Preferred Stock hereunder or to receive a Receipt evidencing Depositary Shares therefor. If a Receipt delivered by the Holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Series F Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be so withdrawn, deliver to such Holder, or subject to Section 2.3 upon his order, a new Receipt evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.
In no event will fractional shares of Series F Preferred Stock (or any cash payment in lieu thereof) be delivered by the Depositary. Delivery of the Series F Preferred Stock and money and other property, if any, being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate.
If the Series F Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the Record Holder of the related Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of such Series F Preferred Stock, such Holder shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such Holder for withdrawal of such shares of Series F Preferred Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer in blank.
Delivery of the Series F Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal shall be made by the Depositary at the Depositary's Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the Holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the Holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such Holder.
Section 2.5. Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts.
As a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, surrender or exchange of any Receipt, the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Corporation may require payment to it of a sum sufficient for the payment (or, in the event that the Depositary or the Corporation shall have made such payment, the reimbursement to it) of any charges or expenses payable by the Holder of a Receipt pursuant to Section 5.7, may require the production of evidence satisfactory to it as to the identity and
 
genuineness of any signature, and may also require compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or the Corporation may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and/or applicable law.
The deposit of the Series F Preferred Stock may be refused, the delivery of Receipts against Series F Preferred Stock may be suspended, the registration of transfer of Receipts may be refused and the registration of transfer, surrender or exchange of outstanding Receipts may be suspended (i) during any period when the register of stockholders of the Corporation is closed or (ii) if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Corporation at any time or from time to time because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission or under any provision of this Deposit Agreement.
Section 2.6. Lost Receipts, etc.
In case any Receipt shall be mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Depositary in its discretion may execute and deliver a Receipt of like form and tenor in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Receipt, or in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt, upon (i) the filing by the Holder thereof with the Depositary of evidence satisfactory to the Depositary of such destruction or loss or theft of such Receipt, of the authenticity thereof and of his or her ownership thereof and (ii) the Holder thereof furnishing of the Depositary with reasonable indemnification satisfactory to the Depositary.
Section 2.7. Cancellation and Destruction of Surrendered Receipts.
All Receipts surrendered to the Depositary or any Depositary's Agent shall be cancelled by the Depositary. Except as prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Depositary is authorized and directed to destroy all Receipts so cancelled.
Section 2.8. Redemption of Series F Preferred Stock.
Whenever the Corporation shall be permitted and shall elect to redeem shares of Series F Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate, it shall (unless otherwise agreed to in writing with the Depositary) give or cause to be given to the Depositary, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (as defined below), notice of the date of such proposed redemption of Series F Preferred Stock and of the number of such shares held by the Depositary to be so redeemed and the applicable redemption price, which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Corporation stating that such redemption of Series F Preferred Stock is in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate. On the date of such redemption, provided that the Corporation shall then have paid or caused to be paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price of the Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed, (i) plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, or (ii) in the case of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined in the Certificate) plus any declared and unpaid dividends and any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, in each case in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Series F Preferred Stock. The Depositary shall mail notice of the Corporation's redemption of Series F Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the number
 
of Depositary Shares representing the Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of such Series F Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares (the "Redemption Date"), to the Record Holders of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed at their respective last addresses as they appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither failure to mail any such notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more such Holders nor any defect in any notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more such Holders shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption as to the other Holders. Each such notice shall be prepared by the Corporation and shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the number of Depositary Shares to be redeemed and, if less than all the Depositary Shares held by any such Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such Holder to be so redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends in respect of the Series F Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date. In case less than all the outstanding Depositary Shares are to be redeemed, the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable.
Notice having been mailed by the Depositary as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation shall have failed to provide the funds necessary to redeem the Series F Preferred Stock evidenced by the Depositary Shares called for redemption) (i) dividends on the shares of Series F Preferred Stock so called for Redemption shall cease to accrue from and after such date, (ii) the Depositary Shares being redeemed from such proceeds shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding, (iii) all rights of the Holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate, and (iv) upon surrender in accordance with such redemption notice of the Receipts evidencing any such Depositary Shares called for redemption (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary or applicable law shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed by the Depositary at a redemption price per Depositary Share equal to one-one thousandth of the redemption price per share of Series F Preferred Stock so redeemed plus all money and other property, if any, represented by such Depositary Shares, including all amounts paid by the Corporation in respect of dividends which on the Redemption Date have been declared on the shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be so redeemed and have not therefore been paid.
If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the Holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with the redemption payment, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
 
Section 3.1. Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
Any Holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file such proof of residence, or other matters or other information, to execute such certificates and to make such representations and warranties as the Depositary or the Corporation may reasonably deem necessary or proper. The Depositary or the Corporation may withhold the delivery, or delay the registration of transfer or redemption, of any Receipt or the withdrawal of the Series F Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares and evidenced by a Receipt or the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof until such proof or other information is filed or such certificates are executed or such representations and warranties are made.
Section 3.2. Payment of Taxes or Other Governmental Charges.
Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain charges and expenses, as provided in Section 5.7. Registration of transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of Series F Preferred Stock and all money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused until any such payment due is made, and any dividends, interest payments or other distributions may be withheld or any part of or all the Series F Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt and not theretofore sold may be sold for the account of the Holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such Holder prior to such sale), and such dividends, interest payments or other distributions or the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such charges or expenses, the Holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
Section 3.3. Warranty as to Series F Preferred Stock.
The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that the Series F Preferred Stock, when issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Series F Preferred Stock and the issuance of the related Receipts.
Section 3.4. Warranty as to Receipts.
The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will represent legal and valid interests in the Series F Preferred Stock. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Series F Preferred Stock and the issuance of the Receipts.
Section 4.1. Cash Distributions.
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the Series F Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to Record Holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such Holders; provided, however, that in case the Corporation or the Depositary shall be required to withhold and shall withhold from any
 
cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Series F Preferred Stock an amount on account of taxes, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount, however, as can be distributed without attributing to any Holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent, and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next sum received by the Depositary for distribution to Record Holders of Receipts then outstanding. Each Holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with its certified tax identification number on a properly completed Form W-8 or W-9, as may be applicable. Each Holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distributions to be made hereunder.
Section 4.2. Distributions Other than Cash, Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or privileges upon the Series F Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to Record Holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipts held by such Holders, in any manner that the Depositary may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. If in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such Record Holders, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Corporation or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes) the Depositary deems, after consultation with the Corporation, such distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may, with the approval of the Corporation, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, in a commercially reasonable manner. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by the Depositary to Record Holders of Receipts as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Corporation shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Depositary and the Depositary shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Holders of Receipts unless the Corporation shall have provided an opinion of counsel stating that such securities or property have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered in connection with such distributions.
Section 4.3. Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
If the Corporation shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names the Series F Preferred Stock is recorded on the books of the Corporation any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the Record Holders of Receipts in such manner as the Depositary may determine, either by the issue to such Record Holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Depositary in its discretion with the approval of the Corporation; provided, however, that (i) if at
 
the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Depositary determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation with the Corporation) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to Holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise, or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by Holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then the Depositary, in its discretion (with approval of the Corporation, in any case where the Depositary has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges permit such transfer, sell such rights, preferences or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by the Depositary to the Record Holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for Holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that it will file promptly a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its best efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the Holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such registration statement shall have become effective, or the Corporation shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to the effect that the offering and sale of such securities to the Holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether any other action under the laws of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to Holders of Receipts, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that the Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such Holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
Section 4.4. Notice of Dividends, etc.; Fixing Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the Series F Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of the Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of the Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever the Depositary and the Corporation shall decide it is appropriate, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Corporation with respect to or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Series F Preferred Stock) for the determination of the Holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights,
 
preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, or who shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate reasons.
Section 4.5. Voting Rights.
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate, upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Record Holders of Receipts a notice prepared by the Corporation which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and (ii) a statement that the Holders may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Series F Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by the Corporation) and a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Series F Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. The Corporation hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Series F Preferred Stock or cause such Series F Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from Holders of Receipts, the Depositary will vote the Series F Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts of such Holders proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received from the other Holders.
Section 4.6. Changes Affecting Deposited Securities and Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, etc.
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Series F Preferred Stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Corporation or to which it is a party, the Depositary may in its discretion with the approval of, and shall upon the instructions of, the Corporation, and (in either case) in such manner as the Depositary may deem equitable, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Corporation in the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Series F Preferred Stock and in the ratio of the redemption price per Depositary Share to the redemption price per share of Series F Preferred Stock, in each case as may be necessary fully to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series F Preferred Stock, or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and (ii) treat any securities which shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Series F Preferred Stock as new deposited securities so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Series F Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may in its discretion, with the approval of the Corporation, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited securities. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par
 
or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Series F Preferred Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Series F Preferred Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares and other securities and property and cash into which the Series F Preferred Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such Series F Preferred Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
Section 4.7. Delivery of Reports.
The Depositary shall furnish to Holders of Receipts any reports and communications received from the Corporation which is received by the Depositary and which the Corporation is required to furnish to the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock.

The Depositary shall keep books at the Depositary's Office for the registration and registration of transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the Record Holders of Receipts; provided that any such Holder requesting to exercise such right shall certify to the Depositary that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts.
The Depositary may close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Depositary may, with the approval of the Corporation, appoint a Registrar for registration of the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby. If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Series F Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national securities exchanges, the Depositary will
 
appoint a Registrar (acceptable to the Corporation) for registration of the Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with any requirements of such exchange. Such Registrar (which may be the Depositary if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Depositary upon the request or with the approval of the Corporation. If the Receipts, Depositary Shares or Series F Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other securities exchanges, the Depositary will, at the request of the Corporation, arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of the Receipts, Depositary Shares or Series F Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable securities exchange regulation.

Section 5.3. Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Corporation.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to Holders of Receipts other than for its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Depositary, nor the Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be liable in any event for special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits).
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts which in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
 
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the written advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information from any person presenting Series F Preferred Stock for deposit, any Holder of a Receipt or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such information. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar and the Corporation may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon or omitting to act upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action is not taken in bad faith. The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar.
The Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, and any Registrar may own and deal in any class of securities of the Corporation and its affiliates and in Receipts. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Corporation and its affiliates.
The Depositary shall not be under any liability for interest on any monies at any time received by it pursuant to any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Receipts, the Depositary Shares or the Series F Preferred Stock nor shall it be obligated to segregate such monies from other monies held by it, except as required by law. The Depositary shall not be responsible for advancing funds on behalf of the Corporation and shall have no duty or obligation to make any payments if it has not timely received sufficient funds to make timely payments.
In the event the Depositary believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the Depositary hereunder, or in the administration of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Depositary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering to take any action hereunder, the Depositary may, in its sole discretion upon written notice to the Corporation, refrain from taking any action and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Corporation, any Holders of Receipts or any other person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Depositary receives written instructions or a certificate signed by the Corporation which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary or which proves or establishes the applicable matter to the satisfaction of the Depositary.
Section 5.4. Resignation and Removal of the Depositary; Appointment of Successor Depositary.
The Depositary may at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by delivering notice of its election to do so to the Corporation, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
 
The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Corporation by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary hereunder and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Corporation shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor Depositary, which shall be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If no successor Depositary shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed Depositary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Depositary. Every successor Depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Corporation an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Corporation, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Series F Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor, and shall deliver to such successor a list of the Record Holders of all outstanding Receipts and such records, books and other information in its possession relating thereto.

The Corporation agrees that it will deliver to the Depositary, and the Depositary will, promptly after receipt thereof, transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts, in each case at the addresses recorded in the Depositary's books, copies of all notices and reports (including without limitation financial statements) required by law, by the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the Series F Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts are listed or by the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the Certificate), to be furnished to the Record Holders of Receipts. Such transmission will be at the Corporation's expense and the Corporation will provide the Depositary with such number of copies of such documents as the Depositary may reasonably request. In addition, the Depositary will transmit to the Record Holders of Receipts at the Corporation's expense such other documents as may be requested by the Corporation.
 
Section 5.6. Indemnification by the Corporation.

The obligations of the Corporation set forth in this Section 5.6 shall survive any succession of any Depositary, Registrar or Depositary's Agent.
Section 5.7. Fees, Charges and Expenses.
The Corporation agrees promptly to pay the Depositary the compensation to be agreed upon with the Corporation for all services rendered by the Depositary hereunder and to reimburse the Depositary for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Depositary without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part (or on the part of any agent or Depositary Agent) in connection with the services rendered by it (or such agent or Depositary Agent) hereunder. The Corporation shall pay all charges of the Depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the Series F Preferred Stock and the initial issuance of the Depositary Shares, all withdrawals of shares of Series F Preferred Stock by owners of Depositary Shares, and any redemption or exchange of the Series F Preferred Stock at the option of the Corporation. The Corporation shall pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. All other transfer and other taxes and governmental charges shall be at the expense of Holders of Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts. If, at the request of a Holder of Receipts, the Depositary incurs charges or expenses for which the Corporation is not otherwise liable hereunder, such Holder will be liable for such charges and expenses; provided, however, that the Depositary may, at its sole option, require a Holder of a Receipt to prepay the Depositary any charge or expense the Depositary has been asked to incur at the request of such Holder of Receipts. The Depositary shall present its statement for charges and expenses to the Corporation at such intervals as the Corporation and the Depositary may agree.
Section 6.1. Amendment.
The form of the Receipts and any provisions of this Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Corporation and the Depositary in any respect which they may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no such amendment which shall materially and adversely alter the rights of the Holders of Receipts shall be effective against the Holders of Receipts unless such amendment shall have been approved by the Holders of Receipts representing in the aggregate at least a two-thirds majority of the Depositary Shares then outstanding. Every Holder of an outstanding Receipt at the time any such amendment
 
becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the Depositary Agreement as amended thereby. In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 and Article III, of any owner of Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt evidencing such Depositary Shares to the Depositary with instructions to deliver to the Holder the Series F Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law or the rules and regulations of any governmental body, agency or commission, or applicable securities exchange.
