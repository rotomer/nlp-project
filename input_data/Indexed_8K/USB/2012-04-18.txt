On April 18, 2012, U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") submitted redemption notices to the property trustee for each trust listed below, which will result in the redemption of the trust preferred securities identified below on the redemption date specified for each security. The trust preferred securities will be redeemed at the redemption price of $25 per trust preferred security plus accrued and unpaid distributions through the redemption date. The USB Capital XI trust preferred securities have been callable at any time on or after September 15, 2011, and the USB Capital XII trust preferred securities have been callable at any time on or after February 15, 2012. Under applicable regulatory capital guidelines issued by bank regulatory agencies, upon notice of redemption, these trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital for the Company. These redemptions are consistent with the capital plan the Company submitted to the Federal Reserve Board, and will be funded in part by proceeds from the public offering of depositary shares representing an interest in the Company's Series G Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, which offering commenced on April 17, 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
