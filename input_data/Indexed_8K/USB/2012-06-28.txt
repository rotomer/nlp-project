On June 28, 2012, U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") submitted a redemption notice to the property trustee for the trust listed below, which will result in the redemption of the trust preferred securities identified below on the redemption date specified. The trust preferred securities will be redeemed at the redemption price of $1,000 per trust preferred security plus accrued and unpaid distributions through the redemption date. The Company has determined that a Regulatory Capital Event (as such term is defined in the indenture governing the junior subordinated debentures underlying the trust preferred securities) has occurred, thereby entitling it to redeem such junior subordinated debentures and the underlying trust preferred securities. Under applicable regulatory capital guidelines issued by bank regulatory agencies, upon notice of redemption, these trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital for the Company. This redemption is consistent with the capital plan the Company submitted to the Federal Reserve Board, and will be funded by general corporate reserves.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
