Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1,415 million for the second quarter of 2012, 17.6 percent higher than the $1,203 million for the second quarter of 2011 and 5.8 percent higher than the $1,338 million for the first quarter of 2012. Diluted earnings per common share of $.71 in the second quarter of 2012 were $.11 higher than the second quarter of 2011 and $.04 higher than the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.67 percent and 16.5 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2012, compared with 1.54 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2011. During the second quarter, the Company recorded an accrual related to its portion of indemnification obligations associated with Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) litigation matters, which reduced diluted earnings per common share by $.02 ("Visa accrual"). The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2012 was $50 million lower than net charge-offs, compared with a provision for credit losses $90 million lower than net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2012 and $175 million lower than net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2011.
U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "I am exceptionally proud of our Company's second quarter 2012 results, as we reported record diluted earnings per common share of $.71, an 18.3 percent increase over the prior year's quarter and a 6.0 percent increase over the first quarter of 2012. Further, our performance metrics remained industry-leading and within the

range of our long-term objectives, with a return on average assets of 1.67 percent, a return on average common equity of 16.5 percent and an efficiency ratio of 51.1 percent.
"Our results benefited from solid balance sheet and fee income growth this quarter. Both average loans and average deposits increased over the second quarter of last year and the prior quarter. On a linked quarter basis, average total loans grew by 1.9 percent, slightly higher than the linked quarter growth we experienced in the first quarter, driven once again by the commercial loan and residential mortgage categories, indicating that we are continuing to gain market share. Our investment in mortgage banking over the past few years was very well-timed, as we posted both record origination volume and revenue in the second quarter. All three categories of payments-related revenue were seasonally strong this quarter. In fact, we achieved growth in virtually every fee category this period versus the prior quarter. Expenses were well-controlled, and we achieved positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.
"Credit quality continued to improve this quarter with net charge-offs and nonperforming assets (excluding covered assets) declining by 8.9 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of average total loans in the second quarter were .98 percent  moving below our "through the cycle" average net charge-off ratio of 1 percent. Given the positive changes in nonperforming assets, as well as the favorable changes in early and late-stage delinquencies and criticized assets, we expect further improvement in credit quality in the third quarter.
"Our capital position remains strong with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 8.8 percent and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.7 percent at June 30th. On June 7th, the Federal Reserve released its proposed Basel III rules for comment. Based on our preliminary assessment of the full impact of the proposed rules for the Basel III standardized approach, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was approximately 7.9 percent at June 30th. Year-to-date we have returned 62 percent of our earnings to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
"Consistent, predictable, repeatable  these are the three words that best describe and frame our Company's operating philosophy and performance objectives. We continue to invest for the long-term in a diverse, stable mix of businesses, products, and services that are delivered by dedicated and engaged employees, fulfilling and supporting the needs of our customers and the communities we serve. Our Company's record earnings this quarter demonstrate the benefits we have derived from our diverse business mix and adherence to a straightforward approach to doing business that continues to allow us to deliver industry-leading performance and returns to our shareholders."

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the second quarter of 2012 was $212 million (17.6 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011 and $77 million (5.8 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2012. The increase in net income year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis was the result of growth in total net revenue, driven by increases in both net interest income and fee-based revenue, and a lower provision for credit losses. These positive variances were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the second quarter of 2012 was $5,068 million; $378 million (8.1 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011, reflecting a 6.6 percent increase in net interest income and a 9.7 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was largely the result of an increase in average earning assets and continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding. Noninterest income increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue and merchant processing services revenue, partially offset by reductions in credit and debit card revenue and ATM processing services revenue. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $139 million (2.8 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, principally due to strong mortgage banking and payments-related revenue.

Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2012 was $2,601 million; $176 million (7.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011 and $41 million (1.6 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2012. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to higher compensation expense, employee benefits costs, mortgage servicing review-related professional services costs and other expense, which included the Visa accrual. Total noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was higher primarily due to the Visa accrual, as increases in compensation and professional services expenses were offset by lower marketing and business development expense and seasonally lower employee benefits costs.
The Company's provision for credit losses declined from a year ago and on a linked quarter basis. The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2012 was $470 million, $11 million lower than the first quarter of 2012 and $102 million lower than the second quarter of 2011. The provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by $50 million in the second quarter of 2012, $90 million in the first quarter of 2012, and $175 million in the second quarter of 2011. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2012 were $520 million, compared with $571 million in the first quarter of 2012, and $747 million in the second quarter of 2011. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to be modestly lower in the third quarter of 2012.
Nonperforming assets include assets originated or acquired by the Company, as well as loans and other real estate acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company ("covered assets"). Excluding covered assets, nonperforming assets were $2,256 million at June 30, 2012, $2,423 million at March 31, 2012, and $3,262 million at June 30, 2011. The decline on a year-over-year basis was led by a reduction in commercial and commercial real estate nonperforming assets. Notably, commercial mortgage and construction and development nonperforming assets declined by $674 million (49.4 percent), as the Company continued to resolve and reduce exposure to these problem assets. On a linked quarter basis, there was a reduction in nonperforming assets in a majority of the portfolios, reflecting the stabilizing economy. Beginning in the second quarter of 2012, the Company included junior lien loans and lines greater than 120 days past due, as well as junior lien loans and lines behind a first lien greater than 180 days past due or in nonaccrual status, as nonperforming loans. Other retail nonperforming assets increased $117 million compared with the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to this policy change. Covered nonperforming assets were $773 million at June 30, 2012, $1,031 million at March 31, 2012, and $1,389 million at June 30, 2011. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered loans, was 2.34 percent at June 30, 2012, compared with 2.44 percent at March 31, 2012, and 2.83

percent at June 30, 2011. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered loans, was 2.25 percent at June 30, 2012, compared with 2.32 percent at March 31, 2012, and 2.66 percent at June 30, 2011The Company expects total nonperforming assets to trend lower in the third quarter of 2012.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the second quarter of 2012 was $2,713 million, compared with $2,544 million in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of $169 million (6.6 percent). The increase was principally the result of growth in average earning assets and lower cost core deposit funding. The year-over-year increase was also impacted by the first quarter 2012 change in the classification of credit card balance transfer fees. Average earning assets were $26.2 billion (9.4 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011, driven by increases of $15.3 billion (7.7 percent) in average total loans and $10.2 billion (16.2 percent) in average investment securities. Net interest income increased $23 million (.9 percent) on a linked quarter basis, the result of growth in average earning assets, including lower yielding investment securities and average total loans. The net interest margin in the second quarter of 2012 was 3.58 percent, compared with 3.67 percent in the second quarter of 2011, and 3.60 percent in the first quarter of 2012. The

expected decline in the net interest margin year-over-year reflected higher balances in lower yielding investment securities and a decline in loan yields, partially offset by lower deposit rates and a reduction in the average cash balances held at the Federal Reserve compared with the second quarter of 2011, as well as the credit card balance transfer fees classification change in the first quarter of 2012. On a linked quarter basis, the decline in the net interest margin reflected an increase in lower yielding investment securities and lower loan yields, partially offset by a reduction in average cash balances held at the Federal Reserve and lower rates on long-term debt.
 
Average total loans were $15.3 billion (7.7 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2012 than the second quarter of 2011, driven by growth in total commercial loans (19.9 percent), residential mortgages (19.6 percent), credit card loans (5.1 percent) and total commercial real estate loans (3.0 percent). These increases were partially offset by declines in total other retail (.1 percent) and covered loans (17.7 percent). Average total loans, excluding covered loans, were higher by 10.0 percent year-over-year. Impacting the increase in average credit card loans was a purchase of approximately $700 million of consumer credit cards

in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average total loans were $3.9 billion (1.9 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2012 than the first quarter of 2012 with increases in total commercial loans (5.1 percent), residential mortgages (3.5 percent) and total commercial real estate loans (1.6 percent), partially offset by a decrease in covered loans (5.3 percent). Excluding covered loans, average total loans grew by 2.4 percent on a linked quarter basis.
Average investment securities in the second quarter of 2012 were $10.2 billion (16.2 percent) higher year-over-year and $1.7 billion (2.4 percent) higher than the prior quarter. The increases over the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency-backed securities.
 
Average total deposits for the second quarter of 2012 were $21.9 billion (10.5 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $15.8 billion (32.5 percent) year-over-year, with growth in average balances in a majority of the lines of business including Wholesale Banking, Wealth Management and Securities Services, and Consumer and Small Business Banking. Average total savings deposits were $5.1 billion (4.4 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking and corporate trust average balances, partially offset by lower broker-dealer average balances. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were slightly lower, while time deposits greater than $100,000 were $1.6 billion (5.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011, principally in broker-dealer average balances.

Average total deposits increased $3.0 billion (1.3 percent) over the first quarter of 2012. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $948 million (1.5 percent) on a linked quarter basis, mainly driven by growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking. Total average savings deposits decreased $2.3 billion (1.9 percent) on a linked quarter basis due to lower corporate and institutional trust and Wholesale Banking average balances, partially offset by an increase in Consumer and Small Business Banking average balances. Compared with the first quarter of 2012, average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were flat, while time deposits greater than $100,000 increased $4.5 billion (16.5 percent), primarily in Wholesale Banking.
 
Noninterest Income
Second quarter noninterest income was $2,355 million; $209 million (9.7 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2011 and $116 million (5.2 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by strong mortgage banking revenue and higher merchant processing services revenue. The $251 million increase in mortgage banking revenue over the same quarter of last year was principally due to higher origination and sales revenue. The $21 million (6.2 percent) increase in merchant processing services revenue was primarily due to increased transaction volumes. Other income increased $22 million (12.6 percent) year-over-year, principally due to higher retail

lease residual revenue. Offsetting these positive variances was a $51 million (17.8 percent) decrease in credit and debit card revenue due to lower debit card interchange fees as a result of fourth quarter of 2011 legislation, net of mitigation efforts, and a change in the classification of credit card balance transfer fees from noninterest income to interest income beginning in the first quarter of 2012. However, these negative variances were partially offset by higher transaction volumes and an $18 million credit related to the final expiration of debit card customer rewards. ATM processing services revenue decreased $25 million (21.9 percent), due to classifying surcharge revenue passed through to others as a reduction of revenue beginning in the first quarter of 2012, rather than occupancy expense as in previous periods. In addition, the second quarter of 2012 had an $11 million unfavorable change in net securities losses compared with the same quarter of 2011, as the Company recognized impairment on a number of securities following the recent downgrades of money center banks by a rating agency.
Noninterest income was $116 million (5.2 percent) higher in the second quarter of 2012 than the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to strong mortgage banking and payments-related revenue. Credit and debit card revenue increased $33 million (16.3 percent) due to higher transaction volumes and legislative-mitigation efforts, including a credit for the final expiration of debit card customer rewards. Corporate payment products revenue increased $15 million (8.6 percent) and merchant processing services revenue increased $22 million (6.5 percent), primarily due to higher volumes. Mortgage banking revenue was $38 million (8.4 percent) higher compared with the first quarter of 2012, principally due to higher mortgage production. Trust and investment management fees increased $10 million (4.0 percent) on a linked quarter basis, reflecting account growth, including business expansion. These positive variances were partially offset by the $19 million of net securities losses in the current quarter.

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2012 totaled $2,601 million, an increase of $176 million (7.3 percent) over the second quarter of 2011, and a $41 million (1.6 percent) increase over the first quarter of 2012. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to higher compensation expense, employee benefits expense, professional services expense and other expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased over the prior year by $72 million (7.2 percent) and $19 million (9.0 percent), respectively. The increase in compensation expense was primarily the result of growth in staffing for business initiatives and mortgage servicing-related activities, in addition to merit increases. Employee benefits expense increased principally due to higher pension costs and staffing levels. Professional services expense was $54 million (65.9 percent) higher year-over-year, principally due to mortgage servicing review-related projects. Technology and communications expense was $12 million (6.3 percent) higher year-over-year, due to business expansion and technology projects. In addition, other expense increased $52 million (11.6 percent) and included the Visa accrual and higher mortgage servicing costs, partially offset by lower FDIC insurance expense. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in net occupancy and equipment expense of $19 million (7.6 percent), principally reflecting the change in classification in the first quarter of 2012 of ATM surcharge revenue passed through to others and a $10 million (11.1 percent) decrease in marketing and business development expense due to the timing of advertising campaigns.

Noninterest expense was $41 million (1.6 percent) higher than the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the Visa accrual. Compensation expense increased $24 million (2.3 percent) on a linked quarter basis, due to the impact of merit increases and higher staffing. Professional services expense was $52 million (61.9 percent) higher due to mortgage servicing review-related projects. Other expense increased by $13 million (2.7 percent) primarily due to the Visa accrual and costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects, partially offset by lower regulatory and insurance-related costs. These increases were partially offset by a $31 million (11.9 percent) decrease in employee benefits expense reflecting seasonally lower costs and a $29 million (26.6 percent) decline in marketing and business development expense due to the timing of charitable contributions and payments-related initiatives.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2012 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 31.0 percent (effective tax rate of 29.0 percent), compared with 30.4 percent (effective tax rate of 28.0 percent) in the second quarter of 2011 and 30.9 percent (effective tax rate of 28.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2012.

Credit Quality
Net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis as economic conditions continued to slowly improve. The allowance for credit losses was $4,864 million at June 30, 2012, compared with $4,919 million at March 31, 2012, and $5,308 million at June 30, 2011. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2012 were $520 million, compared with $571 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $747 million in the second quarter of 2011. The decrease in total net charge-offs was due to improvement in the commercial and commercial real estate and other retail portfolios, compared with the first quarter of 2012. The Company recorded $470 million of provision for credit losses, $50 million less than net charge-offs, during the second quarter of 2012. The allowance for credit losses reimbursable by the FDIC decreased to $65 million at June 30, 2012.
Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs decreased to $124 million (.52 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $157 million (.68 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2012, and $260 million (1.22 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011.
Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs decreased to $109 million (1.12 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $112 million (1.19 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2012 and $119 million (1.46 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011. Credit card loan net charge-offs remained relatively flat at $170 million (4.10 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $169 million (4.05 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2012, and lower than the $216 million (5.45 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011. Total other retail loan net charge-offs were $117 million (.98 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2012, lower than both the $132 million (1.11 percent of average loans outstanding) in the first quarter of 2012, and the $147 million (1.23 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2011.
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.25 percent (2.34 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2012, compared with 2.32 percent (2.44 percent excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2012, and 2.66 percent (2.83 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 196 percent (247 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2012, compared with 174 percent (238 percent excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2012, and 140 percent (188 percent excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011.

Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2012, totaled $3,029 million, compared with $3,454 million at March 31, 2012, and $4,651 million at June 30, 2011. Total nonperforming assets at June 30, 2012, included $773 million of covered assets. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 1.40 percent (1.11 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2012, compared with 1.63 percent (1.22 percent

excluding covered assets) at March 31, 2012, and 2.32 percent (1.77 percent excluding covered assets) at June 30, 2011. The decrease in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, compared with a year ago was driven primarily by reductions in the construction and development portfolio, as well as by improvement in commercial mortgages and other commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming other retail loans primarily due to the policy change for junior lien lines and loans.
Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $1,315 million ($663 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2012, lower than the $1,492 million ($750 million excluding covered loans) at March 31, 2012, and the $1,732 million ($804 million excluding covered loans) at June 30, 2011. Performing restructured loans, excluding GNMA and covered loans, decreased $70 million compared with March 31, 2012, but increased $778 million compared with June 30, 2011. The increase from a year ago was the result of a change in reporting, whereby the Company now includes residential mortgage loans under trial modification in these totals. The increase also reflects the impact of new accounting guidance adopted in the third quarter of 2011.
 
Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders' equity was $37.8 billion at June 30, 2012, compared with $35.9 billion at March 31, 2012, and $32.5 billion at June 30, 2011. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.7 percent at June 30, 2012, compared with 10.9 percent at March 31, 2012, and 11.0 percent at June 30, 2011. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.9 percent at June 30, 2012 and at March 31, 2012, compared with 6.5 percent at June 30, 2011. The Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was 8.8

Lines of Business
The Company's major lines of business are Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, Consumer and Small Business Banking, Wealth Management and Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company's diverse customer base. During 2012, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate contributed $330 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $272 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $333 million in the first quarter of 2012. Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate's net income increased $58 million (21.3 percent) over the same quarter of 2011, due to a lower provision for credit losses and lower total noninterest expense, partially offset by lower total net revenue. Net interest income decreased $11 million (2.1 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to lower rates on loans, a decrease in loan fees and the impact of lower rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by higher average loan and deposit balances. Total noninterest income decreased $9 million (2.8 percent), due to lower commercial products revenue, principally lower standby letters of credit and loan commitment fees, partially offset by an increase in other income due to equity investment revenue. Total noninterest expense decreased $6 million (1.9 percent) from a year ago, primarily due to lower FDIC insurance expense and other loan expense. The provision for credit losses was $112 million (100.0 percent) lower year-over-year, due to lower net charge-offs and a reduction in the reserve allocation.

includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $316 million of the Company's net income in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $47 million (12.9 percent) from the same period of 2011, but a $59 million (23.0 percent) increase over the prior quarter.

Credit and debit card revenue decreased due to lower debit card interchange fees as a result of recent legislation, net of mitigation efforts, and the impact of classifying credit card balance transfer fees as interest income in the current year. However, these negative variances were partially offset by higher transaction volumes and an $18 million credit related to the final expiration of debit card customer rewards. Partially offsetting this decrease, corporate payment products revenue and merchant processing services revenue increased due to higher transaction volumes and other revenue increased due to a merchant processing-related gain. Total noninterest expense was flat compared with the second quarter of 2011. The provision for credit losses increased $108 million due to the impact of a reserve release in the second quarter of 2011, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Global and domestic economies could fail to recover from the recent economic downturn or could experience another severe contraction, which could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp's revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Continued stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a delay or failure of recovery in the residential real estate markets, could cause additional credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp's business and financial performance is likely to be negatively impacted by effects of recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp's results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, residual value risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Corporate Risk Profile" contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action provisions applicable to all banks, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
 
 
 
 
 
These measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company's capital position relative to other financial services companies. These measures differ from capital ratios defined by current banking regulations principally in that the numerator excludes trust preferred securities and preferred stock, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
