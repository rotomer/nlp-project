On July 30, 2012, U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") completed the previously announced redemption of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.625% trust preferred securities of USB Capital XIII (the "Trust Preferred Securities"). This redemption resulted in the redesignation of the series of covered debt benefiting from the Companys replacement capital covenants, as amended from time to time, executed (i) March 17, 2006, relating to and in connection with USB Capital IXs issuance of 6.189% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Income Trust Securities; (ii) March 27, 2006, relating to and in connection with the Companys issuance of depositary shares representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock; (iii) December 22, 2006, relating to and in connection with USB Realty Corp.s issuance of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Non-Cumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock; (iv) March 17, 2008, relating to and in connection with the Companys issuance of depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock; (v) June 10, 2010, relating to and in connection with the Companys issuance of depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock; and (vi) April 20, 2012, relating to and in connection with the Companys issuance of depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Series G Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (together, as amended, the "Replacement Capital Covenants"). Additional information with respect to the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenants is summarized in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 23, 2012. The Companys 6.625% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2039 (the "6.625% Debentures"), underlying the Trust Preferred Securities, was previously designated as the covered debt under the Replacement Capital Covenants. As a result of the Companys redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities and the underlying 6.625% Debentures, the 6.625% Debentures ceased being the covered debt under the Replacement Capital Covenants, effective as of July 28, 2012. Effective as of July 28, 2012, the Companys 3.442% Remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "Remarketed Notes") became the covered debt with respect to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenants. Certain of the Replacement Capital Covenants and related amendments are filed as exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
