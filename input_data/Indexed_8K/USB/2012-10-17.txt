 U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today reported record net income of $1,474 million for the third quarter of 2012, or $.74 per diluted common share. Earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were driven by year-over-year growth in total net revenue and positive operating leverage. Highlights for the third quarter of 2012 included:

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1,474 million for the third quarter of 2012, 15.8 percent higher than the $1,273 million for the third quarter of 2011 and 4.2 percent higher than the $1,415 million for the second quarter of 2012. Diluted earnings per common share of $.74 in the third quarter of 2012 were $.10 higher than the third quarter of 2011 and $.03 higher than the previous quarter. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.70 percent and 16.5 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2012, compared with 1.57 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of a credit card portfolio, recorded a charge related to an investment under the equity method of accounting and recorded incremental provision for credit losses for charge-offs related to a regulatory clarification in the treatment of residential mortgage and other consumer loans to borrowers who have exited bankruptcy but continue to make payments on their loans. Taken together, these items had no impact on third quarter diluted earnings per common share. During the second quarter, the Company recorded an accrual related to its portion of indemnification obligations associated with Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) litigation matters, which reduced diluted earnings per common share by $.02 ("Visa accrual"). The provision for credit losses was $50 million lower than net charge-offs in the second and third quarters of 2012 and $150 million lower than net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2011.

U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said, "I am very proud to announce our Company's third quarter results. U.S. Bancorp, today, reported record net income of $1.5 billion, or $.74 diluted earnings per common share, on record total net revenue of $5.2 billion. Once again, we achieved industry-leading performance metrics with returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.70 percent and 16.5 percent, respectively, as well as an efficiency ratio of 50.4 percent. Additionally, we posted positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis, and we achieved these results despite an economy described as only modestly growing and burdened by uncertainty.
"Our third quarter earnings included continued strong mortgage banking activity, which contributed to our growth in fee income, residential real estate loans and loans held for sale. Solid new lending activity outside of mortgage also helped to grow our balance sheet, particularly in commercial loans, which grew on average by 21.9 percent year-over-year and 4.2 percent on a linked quarter basis. On the retail side, automobile loans and leases, a national business for our Company, also continued to show good growth in the quarter. Finally, strong growth in average deposits over the prior time periods demonstrated that we continued to enjoy a flight to quality as consumers and businesses sought a safe and stable financial partner and, along with the growth in our loan and fee-based businesses, continued to expand our market share.
"The overall credit quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve, as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets, excluding a change in reporting for collateralized loans to consumers who have filed for bankruptcy, both declined on a linked quarter basis. We expect this downward trend in net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to continue in the fourth quarter, with the net charge-off ratio remaining below one percent.
"With our growth in earnings, we continued to generate significant capital. Our capital ratios remained strong with a Tier 1 common ratio of 9.0 percent and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.9 percent at September 30th. Importantly, based on our assessment of the proposed rules for the Basel III standardized approach, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.2 percent at September 30th, above our targeted ratio of 8.0 percent. We are where we need to be in terms of our capital levels. As a result, during the third quarter we were able to return 67 percent of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks  consistent with our goal of returning 60-80 percent of the capital we generate back to our shareholders.
"Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank our almost 66,000 dedicated, engaged employees, who come to work each day with the goal of providing our customers with the products and services they need to

handle their finances, buy a home, prepare for retirement, or manage and expand their businesses. In other words, help them shape their future and reach their dreams. Our industry has an important role to play in the growth and success of each of our customers  large and small  and the economy as a whole. I look forward to being a part of that future for the benefit of our customers, communities, employees and, importantly, our shareholders."
 
Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the third quarter of 2012 was $201 million (15.8 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2011 and $59 million (4.2 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2012. The increase in net income year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis was the result of growth in total net revenue, driven by increases in both net interest income and fee-based revenue. In addition, the year-over-year increase was impacted by a reduction in the provision for credit losses. These positive variances in both periods were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis for the third quarter of 2012 reached a record $5,179 million; $384 million (8.0 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2011, reflecting a 6.1 percent increase in net interest income and a 10.4 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income

year-over-year was the result of higher average earning assets, continued growth in lower cost core deposit funding and the positive impact from lower cost long-term debt. Noninterest income increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by legislative-related reductions in credit and debit card revenue and a reclass of ATM processing services revenue. Total net revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis was $111 million (2.2 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis due to both higher net interest income and fee-based revenue, the latter of which was driven by higher mortgage banking revenue.
Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2012 was $2,609 million; $133 million (5.4 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2011 and $8 million (.3 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2012. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to higher compensation expense, employee benefits costs, and mortgage servicing review-related professional services costsTotal noninterest expense on a linked quarter basis was higher, primarily due to increases in compensation, marketing and business development expense and other expense, offset by the impact of the Visa accrual recorded in the second quarter of 2012.
.
The Company's provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2012 was $488 million, $18 million higher than the prior quarter and $31 million lower than the third quarter of 2011. The third quarter of 2012 provision for credit losses included $54 million in charge-offs related to a regulatory clarification in the treatment of residential mortgage and other consumer loans to borrowers who have exited bankruptcy but continue to make payments on their loans. The provision for credit losses was lower than net charge-offs by $50 million in the third quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2012, and $150 million lower than net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2011. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012 were $538 million, compared with $520 million in the second quarter of 2012, and $669 million in the third quarter of 2011. Given current economic conditions, the Company expects the level of net charge-offs to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Nonperforming assets include assets originated or acquired by the Company, as well as loans and other real estate acquired under FDIC loss sharing agreements that substantially reduce the risk of credit losses to the Company ("covered assets"). Excluding covered assets, nonperforming assets were $2,188 million at September 30, 2012, compared with $2,256 million at June 30, 2012, and $3,036 million at September 30, 2011. The decline was led by a reduction in commercial and commercial real estate nonperforming assets. Notably, commercial mortgage and construction and development nonperforming assets declined by $589

million (48.3 percent) year-over-year and $59 million (8.6 percent) on a linked quarter basis, as the Company continued to resolve and reduce exposure to these problem assets. Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2012, included approximately $109 million of loans placed on nonaccrual status due to the regulatory clarification in the treatment of residential mortgage and other consumer loans to borrowers who have exited bankruptcy but continue to make payments on their loans. In addition, beginning in the second quarter of 2012, the Company included junior lien loans and lines greater than 120 days past due, as well as junior lien loans and lines behind a first lien greater than 180 days past due or on nonaccrual status, as nonperforming loans Covered nonperforming assets were $647 million at September 30, 2012, compared with $773 million at June 30, 2012, and $1,303 million at September 30, 2011. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, excluding covered loans, was 2.26 percent at September 30, 2012, compared with 2.34 percent at June 30, 2012, and 2.66 percent at September 30, 2011. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans, including covered loans, was 2.19 percent at September 30, 2012, compared with 2.25 percent at June 30, 2012, and 2.53 percent at September 30, 2011The Company expects total nonperforming assets to trend lower in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the third quarter of 2012 was $2,783 million, compared with $2,624 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $159 million (6.1 percent). The increase was principally the result of growth in average earning assets and lower cost core deposit funding, as well as reduced rates on long-term debt. The year-over-year increase was also impacted by a change in the classification of credit card balance transfer fees from noninterest income to interest income beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Average earning assets were $22.7 billion (7.9 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2011, driven by increases of $14.8 billion (7.3 percent) in average total loans and $6.2 billion (9.4 percent) in average investment securities. Net interest income increased $70 million (2.6 percent) on a linked quarter basis, the result of growth in average earning assets, including average total loans, average loans held for sale and average cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The net interest margin in the third quarter of 2012 was 3.59 percent, compared with 3.65 percent in the third quarter of 2011, and 3.58 percent in the second quarter of 2012. The decline in the net interest margin year-over-year primarily reflected higher balances in lower yielding investment securities, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and long-term debt. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin was relatively flat, as the reduction in the yield on the investment securities portfolio was offset by favorable funding costs, primarily as a result of lower rates on long-term debt.

Average total loans were $14.8 billion (7.3 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2012 than the third quarter of 2011, driven by growth in commercial loans (21.9 percent), residential mortgages (20.4 percent), commercial mortgages (5.9 percent), credit card loans (3.1 percent) and other retail loans (2.6 percent). These increases were partially offset by declines in construction and development (9.8 percent), home equity and second mortgages (6.4 percent) and covered loans (20.2 percent). Average total loans, excluding covered loans, were higher by 9.6 percent year-over-year. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company sold a nearly $735 million branded consumer and business credit card portfolio. This lowered average loans by approximately $485 million in the third quarter of 2012. This sale was offset year-over-year, by the impact of the purchase of approximately $700 million of consumer credit cards in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average total loans were $2.9 billion (1.3 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2012 than the second quarter of 2012, driven by increases in residential mortgages (4.6 percent), commercial loans (4.2 percent), retail leasing (2.0 percent) and other retail loans (1.0 percent), partially offset by decreases in home equity and second mortgages (1.5 percent), credit card loans (.9 percent) due to the portfolio sale, and covered loans (8.3 percent). Excluding covered loans, average total loans grew by 2.0 percent on a linked quarter basis.

Average investment securities in the third quarter of 2012 were $6.2 billion (9.4 percent) higher year-over-year and $.7 billion (1.0 percent) lower than the prior quarter. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to purchases of U.S. government agency-backed securities. The decrease on a linked quarter basis primarily reflected the sale of non-agency mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities.
 
Average total deposits for the third quarter of 2012 were $23.9 billion (11.1 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2011. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $9.5 billion (16.2 percent) year-over-year, with growth in average balances in a majority of the lines of business, including Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, Wealth Management and Securities Services, and Consumer and Small Business Banking. Average total savings deposits were $7.8 billion (6.9 percent) higher year-over-year, the result of growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking and corporate trust average balances, partially offset by lower government banking and broker-dealer average balances. Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were $.9 billion (5.8 percent) lower, while time deposits greater than $100,000 were $7.5 billion (26.1 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2011, principally in Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate. Time deposits greater than $100,000 are managed as an alternative to other funding sources such as wholesale borrowing, based largely on relative pricing.
Average total deposits increased $8.0 billion (3.5 percent) over the second quarter of 2012. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $3.6 billion (5.6 percent) on a linked quarter basis, mainly driven by growth in Consumer and Small Business Banking and corporate trust average balances. Average total

savings deposits increased slightly, $.5 billion (.5 percent) on a linked quarter basis, due to higher Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate and Consumer and Small Business Banking average balances, partially offset by lower institutional trust average balances. Compared with the second quarter of 2012, average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were lower by $.4 billion (2.7 percent), while average time deposits greater than $100,000 increased $4.3 billion (13.3 percent), primarily in Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate.
 
Noninterest Income
Third quarter noninterest income was $2,396 million; $225 million (10.4 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2011 and $41 million (1.7 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by strong mortgage banking revenue. The $274 million increase in mortgage banking revenue over the same quarter of last year was principally due to higher origination and sales revenue. Merchant processing services revenue increased $7 million (2.1 percent), primarily due to increased transaction volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased $24 million (10.0 percent) year-over-year due to improved market conditions and business expansion. The $13 million (6.1 percent) increase in commercial products revenue was principally driven by higher bond underwriting fees. Investment products fees and commissions increased $7 million (22.6 percent) compared with the prior year due to increased volumes. Other income increased $7 million (3.8 percent) year-over-

year, reflecting the impact of the gain on the credit card portfolio sale, partially offset by the equity-method investment charge and lower retail lease residual revenue. In addition, the third quarter of 2012 had a $10 million favorable change in net securities gains (losses), primarily due to impairments recorded in the prior year. Offsetting these positive variances was a $76 million (26.3 percent) decrease in credit and debit card revenue due to lower debit card interchange fees as a result of legislative-related changes in the fourth quarter of 2011, net of mitigation efforts, and a change in the classification of credit card balance transfer fees from noninterest income to interest income beginning in the first quarter of 2012. However, these negative variances were partially offset by higher transaction volumes. ATM processing services revenue decreased $28 million (24.3 percent), due to classifying surcharge revenue passed through to others as a reduction of revenue beginning in the first quarter of 2012, rather than as occupancy expense as in previous periods. The $9 million (4.9 percent) decrease in deposit service charges reflected process and product changes and lower overdraft volumes.
Noninterest income was $41 million (1.7 percent) higher in the third quarter of 2012 than the second quarter of 2012. Corporate payment products revenue increased $11 million (5.8 percent) due to seasonally higher sales volumes. Deposit service charges were $18 million (11.5 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis due to product redesign and repricing initiatives. A $9 million (4.2 percent) increase in commercial products revenue was principally due to higher syndication fees and bond underwriting revenue. Mortgage banking revenue was $29 million (5.9 percent) higher than the second quarter of 2012 due to higher origination and sales revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), net of hedging activities. In addition, the third quarter of 2012 had a $20 million favorable change in net securities gains (losses), principally due to impairment recognized in the second quarter of 2012 on a number of securities following downgrades of money center banks by a rating agency. These positive variances were offset by a $22 million (9.4 percent) decline in credit and debit card revenue, primarily due to a benefit from the final expiration of debit card customer rewards recognized in the second quarter of 2012 Merchant processing services revenue and treasury management fees decreased $14 million (3.9 percent) and $7 million (4.9 percent), respectively, due to lower volumes. Other income declined $4 million (2.0 percent) on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to the equity-method investment charge and lower retail lease residual revenue, partially offset by the gain on the credit card portfolio sale.

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2012 totaled $2,609 million, an increase of $133 million (5.4 percent) over the third quarter of 2011, and an $8 million (.3 percent) increase over the second quarter of 2012. The increase in total noninterest expense year-over-year was primarily due to higher compensation expense, employee benefits expense and professional services expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased over the prior year by $88 million (8.6 percent) and $22 million (10.8 percent), respectively. The increase in compensation expense was primarily the result of growth in staffing for business initiatives and mortgage servicing-related activities, in addition to higher commissions and merit increases. Employee benefits expense increased principally due to higher pension costs and staffing levels. Professional services expense was $44 million (44.0 percent) higher year-over-year, principally due to mortgage servicing review-related projects. Technology and communications expense was $16 million (8.5 percent) higher year-over-year, due to business expansion and technology projects. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in net occupancy and equipment expense of $19 million (7.5 percent), principally reflecting the change in classification in the first quarter of 2012 of ATM surcharge revenue passed through to others, and a decrease in other intangibles expense of $8 million (10.7 percent) due to the reduction or completion of the amortization of certain intangibles.
Noninterest expense was relatively flat on a linked quarter basis, as increases in compensation and marketing and business development expense were offset by the impact of the Visa accrual recorded in the

second quarter of 2012. Compensation expense increased $33 million (3.1 percent) on a linked quarter basis, due to the impact of an increase in commissions and incentives, as well as higher staffing levels. Professional services expense was $8 million (5.9 percent) higher due to mortgage servicing review-related projects. Marketing and business development was $16 million (20.0 percent) higher compared to the second quarter of 2012 due to the timing of new national media promotions. These increases were partially offset by a $47 million (9.4 percent) decrease in other expense, primarily due to the second quarter of 2012 Visa accrual and lower FDIC insurance costs, partially offset by higher costs related to investments in affordable housing and other tax-advantaged projects.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2012 resulted in a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 31.2 percent (effective tax rate of 29.3 percent), compared with 30.4 percent (effective tax rate of 28.1 percent) in the third quarter of 2011 and 31.0 percent (effective tax rate of 29.0 percent) in the second quarter of 2012.

Credit Quality
Net charge-offs and nonperforming assets declined on a year-over-year basis as economic conditions continued to slowly improve. On a linked quarter basis, net charge-offs increased $18 million (3.5 percent), while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased $68 million (3.0 percent). Both were impacted by the regulatory clarification in the treatment of consumer borrowers exiting bankruptcy. On a linked quarter basis, without the impact of the regulatory clarification, net charge-offs would have decreased by $36 million (6.9 percent) and nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, would have decreased by $177 million (7.8 percent). The allowance for credit losses was $4,771 million at September 30, 2012, compared with $4,864 million at June 30, 2012, and $5,190 million at September 30, 2011. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012 were $538 million, compared with $520 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $669 million in the third quarter of 2011. The $18 million (3.5 percent) increase in total net charge-offs on a linked quarter basis, included $54 million of incremental charge-offs due to regulatory guidance related to residential mortgage and other consumer loans to borrowers who have exited bankruptcy but continue to make payments on their loans, partially offset by improvement in commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. The $131 million (19.6 percent) decline in net charge-offs compared with the prior year was due to improvement in the commercial, commercial real estate and credit card portfolios, compared with the third quarter of 2011, partially offset by the current quarter incremental bankruptcy-related charge-offs in the residential mortgage and other retail portfolios. The Company recorded $488 million of provision for credit losses, $50 million less than net charge-offs, during the third quarter of 2012. The allowance for credit losses reimbursable by the FDIC decreased to $55 million at September 30, 2012. In addition, the allowance for credit losses was reduced by $33 million, as a result of the credit card portfolio sale in the current quarter.
Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs decreased to $91 million (.37 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2012, compared with $124 million (.52 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2012, and $224 million (1.01 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2011.
Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs, including $22 million of current quarter incremental bankruptcy-related charge-offs, were $121 million (1.17 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2012, compared with $109 million (1.12 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2012 and $122 million (1.42 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2011.

Credit card loan net charge-offs were $167 million (4.01 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2012, lower than both the $170 million (4.10 percent of average loans outstanding) in the second quarter of 2012, and the $178 million (4.40 percent of average loans outstanding) in the third quarter of 2011. Total other retail loan net charge-offs included $32 million of the current quarter's incremental bankruptcy-related charge-offs.

compared with a year ago was driven primarily by reductions in the construction and development portfolio, as well as by improvement in commercial mortgages and other commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming other retail loans, primarily due to the policy change for junior lien lines and loans in the second quarter.

Lines of Business
The Company's major lines of business are Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate, Consumer and Small Business Banking, Wealth Management and Securities Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line's operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company's diverse customer base. During 2012, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.

Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate contributed $326 million of the Company's net income in the third quarter of 2012, compared with $304 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $328 million in the second quarter of 2012. Wholesale Banking and Commercial Real Estate's net income increased $22 million (7.2 percent) over the same quarter of 2011, due to a lower provision for credit losses and lower total noninterest expense, partially offset by lower total net revenue. Net interest income decreased $18 million (3.3 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to lower rates on loans, a decrease in loan fees and the impact of lower rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by higher average loan and deposit balances. Total noninterest income decreased $21 million (6.6 percent), driven by lower equity investment revenue and commercial products revenue. Commercial products revenue was lower, principally due to a decline in syndication and other loan fees, commercial leasing revenue and standby letters of credit fees, partially offset by an increase in bond underwriting fees. Total noninterest expense decreased $7 million (2.2 percent) from a year ago, primarily due to lower costs

Total net revenue decreased $16 million (1.9 percent) compared with the prior quarter. Net interest income increased $6 million (1.2 percent) on a linked quarter basis as a result of increased loan and deposit volumes, partially offset by lower loan rates and a reduction in the margin benefit from deposits. Total noninterest income decreased by $22 million (6.9 percent), principally due to a decrease in equity investment revenue in the current quarter and seasonally higher treasury management fees in the second quarter of 2012.

Within Consumer and Small Business Banking, the retail banking division reported a 32.5 percent decrease in its contribution from the same quarter of last year due to lower total net revenue and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower total noninterest expense.

The contribution of the mortgage banking division increased $144 million over the third quarter of 2011 due to higher total net revenue, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest expense. The division's 81.1 percent increase in total net revenue was primarily due to a $267 million increase in total noninterest income, driven by strong mortgage origination and sales revenue. In addition, net interest income increased 35.9 percent, primarily the result of higher average loans held-for-sale. Total noninterest expense was 54.5 percent higher, reflecting higher compensation and employee benefits expense and mortgage servicing review-related costs. The provision for credit losses for the mortgage banking division decreased 10.7 percent due to a change in the reserve allocation.

Total noninterest income decreased $3 million (.4 percent) year-over-year. Credit and debit card revenue decreased due to lower debit card interchange fees as a result of recent legislation, net of mitigation efforts, and the impact of classifying credit card balance transfer fees as interest income in the current year. However, these negative variances were partially offset by higher transaction volumes. Partially offsetting this decrease, other revenue increased due to the impact of the gain on the credit card portfolio sale and merchant processing services revenue increased, principally due to higher transaction volumes. Total noninterest expense was basically flat compared with the third quarter of 2011.

income of $368 million in the second quarter of 2012.

Forward-Looking Statements
The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
This press release contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Global and domestic economies could fail to recover from the recent economic downturn or could experience another severe contraction, which could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp's revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Continued stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a delay or failure of recovery in the residential real estate markets, could cause additional credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp's business and financial performance is likely to be negatively impacted by effects of recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp's results could also be adversely affected by continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer behavior and preferences; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management's ability to effectively manage credit risk, residual value risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Corporate Risk Profile" contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action provisions applicable to all banks, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
 
 
 
 
 
Basel III standardized approach released June 2012.
These measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company's capital position relative to other financial services companies. These measures differ from capital ratios defined by current banking regulations principally in that the numerator excludes trust preferred securities and preferred stock, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
