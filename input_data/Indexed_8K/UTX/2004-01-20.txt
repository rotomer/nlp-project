Exhibit 99.1
 
UTC's FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 9 PERCENT; FULL-YEAR UP 6 PERCENT TO $4.69 PER SHARE WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $2.9 BILLION; 2004 OUTLOOK AFFIRMED
HARTFORD, Conn., January 20, 2004 - United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today reported fourth quarter 2003 earnings per share increased 9 percent to $1.16 compared with the year ago quarter.  Consolidated revenues increased 19 percent to $8.6 billion, primarily reflecting the Chubb acquisition and favorable foreign currency translation.  Full year earnings per share were 6 percent above 2002 on a 10 percent increase in revenues to $31.0 billion.
Fourth quarter net income increased to $588 million, 10 percent above the comparable 2002 period. Cash flow from operations was $798 million including $252 million in voluntary contributions to pension plans globally.  Capital expenditures in the quarter were $208 million. 
Full year earnings per share were $4.69, 6 percent increased from 2002.  Full year cash flow from operations was $2.9 billion.  This result included $994 million in voluntary contributions to pension plans globally and was approximately equal to net income after capital expenditures of $530 million.
"These strong results speak to UTC's operating disciplines and business balance," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George David.  "Double digit operating profit increases at Otis and Carrier and growth in UTC's military aerospace business more than offset the third year of weakness in commercial aviation. The weaker U.S. dollar, growth in China, and the addition of Chubb also contributed to year over year performance."
"Cash performance net of capital expenditures for the year again met our usual high standard," continued David, "essentially equal to net income even after substantial pension contributions."  The company's debt-to-capital ratio decreased six points to 31 percent in 2003 inclusive of the Chubb acquisition. 
A non cash gain at Otis, lower effective tax rate, and the translation benefit from a weaker dollar offset $138 million of restructuring and related charges taken in the quarter.  David said, "That we were able to initiate these significant cost reduction actions positions us well for earnings growth in 2005 and beyond."
"We intend to initiate further cost reduction actions in the first quarter of 2004, funded by the recently announced gain on DaimlerChrysler's sale of MTU to KKR.  There may be further actions later in the year coincident with the potentially favorable settlement of certain open tax years." 
"Our outlook is unchanged," said David.  "We expect 2004 earnings in the range of $5.00 to $5.30 per share.  Cash flow from operations less capital expenditures should equal net income in 2004, before potential voluntary contributions in the $500 million range to UTC's pension plans globally.  We're on top of an excellent year in 2003 and look for more of the same in 2004."
