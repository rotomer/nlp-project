EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
HARTFORD, Conn., January 21, 2005  United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today reported fourth quarter 2004 earnings per share of $1.29 and net income of $650 million, both up 11 percent from the year ago quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 15 percent to $9.8 billion, reflecting organic growth of 6 percent, the addition of the Linde commercial refrigeration business and the continuing benefit of foreign exchange.
 
Full year earnings per share of $5.52 and net income of $2.8 billion were both 18 percent higher than 2003 results. Revenues increased 21 percent to $37.4 billion, including 8 points of organic growth and the benefit of acquisitions.
 
Cash flow from operations was $858 million in the quarter, including $347 million in voluntary contributions to pension plans globally. Capital expenditures were $344 million. For the year, cash flow from operations was $3.7 billion, including $906 million in voluntary pension contributions. After capital expenditures of $795 million, cash flow exceeded net income. Share repurchases totaled nearly $1 billion for the year.
 
"These were exceptional results in 2004," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George David. "Organic revenue growth of 8 percent reflected good conditions and favorable market share trends in many of our markets worldwide. Cost reductions continued and offset higher R&D expenditures, significantly higher commodity costs, pension and healthcare expense headwinds, and the roll-in impacts of lower margin rates in the Chubb and Linde businesses. Several favorable items funded more than $600 million in restructuring actions which will strengthen earnings in 2005 and beyond. Cash flow again exceeded net income, even after more than $900 million in voluntary contributions to our pension plans globally."
 
"Altogether, it was a great year." David continued. "We have momentum going into 2005 and confirm expectations of earnings per share growth of 10-15 percent and cash flow after capital expenditures again in the range of net income before pension contributions."
Fourth quarter results include restructuring costs and favorable items of $0.22 and $0.14 per share, respectively. Foreign currency translation added $.04 to earnings per share in the quarter.
 
For the year, restructuring costs totaled $632 million and exceeded the impact of favorable items. Additional favorable items are anticipated in 2005 to offset costs from 2004 restructuring actions and additional actions likely in 2005.
 
As previously disclosed, the company will include stock option expense in 2005 reported results and restate prior reporting periods for comparability in accordance with recently issued accounting standards on stock based compensation. Stock option expense is not included in 2004 reported results. Such expense was $0.23 per share in 2004 with a similar amount expected for 2005. Including stock option expensing, UTC's 10-15 percent growth expectation for 2005 translates to an earnings per share range of $5.85 to $6.10.
 
The accompanying tables include information integral to assessing the company's financial position, operating performance, and cash flow.
