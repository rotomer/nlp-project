meeting, , , that if the shareholder represents in such request that he or she intends, and is prepared, to commence a consent solicitation as soon as is permitted by the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder and other applicable law, the Secretary shall as promptly as practicable, call a special meeting of the Board of Directors, which meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable.

SECTION 2 - Board of Directors
SECTION 2.1

SECTION 2.2
Election.
The directors shall be elected annually.

For purposes of this Section 2.2, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination thereof being made by the Secretary (a) as of the close of the applicable notice of nomination period set forth in Section 1.10 of these Bylaws based on whether one or more notice(s) of nomination were timely filed in accordance with said Section 1.10 or (b) if later, reasonably promptly following the determination by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction that one or more notice(s) of nomination were timely filed in accordance with said Section 1.10; provided that the determination that an election is a "contested election" by the Secretary pursuant to clause (a) or (b) shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity. If, prior to the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the shareholders, one or more notices of nomination are withdrawn (or declared invalid or untimely by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction) such that the number of candidates for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the election shall not be considered a contested election, but in all other cases, once an election is determined to be a contested election, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.

Subject to the approval of either (i) the Chief Executive Officer or (ii) the General Counsel and the Chief Financial Officer acting together and upon such terms and conditions as the approving officer or officers deem appropriate, the Corporation may provide independent legal counsel or pay or reimburse the expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by any person who is or was an employee of the Corporation, any constituent corporation or any Subsidiary and any such person who serves or served as such or in a fiduciary capacity at the request of one of the foregoing entities with another enterprise in advance of the final disposition of any such proceeding, promptly upon receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking of such person to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.
 
(C) The rights provided by this Section 6.5 to any person who serves or served as a director or officer of the Corporation, a constituent corporation or a Subsidiary or as such or in a fiduciary capacity with an other enterprise at the request of one of the foregoing entities shall be rights of contract enforceable against the Corporation by such person, who shall be presumed to have relied upon such rights in determining to serve or continuing to serve in such capacity, and shall vest at the time such person begins serving in such capacity. In addition, the rights provided to any such person by this Section 6.5 shall survive the termination of such person's service in any such capacity. Such rights shall continue as long as such person shall be subject to any possible proceeding. No amendment of this Section 6.5 shall impair the rights of any such person arising at any time with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment.
(D) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.5, except for proceedings to enforce rights provided in this Section 6.5, the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Section 6.5 to provide any indemnification or any payment or reimbursement of expenses to any director, officer, employee or other person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person (which shall not include counterclaims or cross-claims initiated by others) unless the Board of Directors has authorized or consented to such proceeding (or part thereof) in a resolution adopted by the Board.
(E) For purposes of this Section 6.5, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity in which the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the economic or voting ownership interest or voting power to elect a majority of the directors of such entity; the term "other enterprise" shall include any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, association or other unincorporated organization or other entity and any employee benefit plan; service "at the request of the Corporation" shall include service as a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of the Corporation, a constituent corporation or a Subsidiary which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such person with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be indemnifiable expenses; and action by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan which such person reasonably believes to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to be action not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.
(F) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall limit the power of the Corporation or the Board of Directors to provide rights of indemnification and to make payment and reimbursement of expenses, including attorneys' fees, to directors, officers, employees, agents, fiduciaries and other persons otherwise than pursuant to this Section 6.5. The rights to indemnification and to receive payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Section 6.5 shall not be exclusive of any other rights which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement or otherwise.
(G) If any provision or provisions of this Section 6.5 shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Section 6.5 (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Section 6.5 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Section 6.5 (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Section 6.5 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

Any such rights, if provided, shall have the same force and effect as they would have if they were conferred in this Section 6.5.
(I) Subject to the approval of either the Chief Financial Officer or the Vice President, Treasurer, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance in such amounts as the Board of Directors deems appropriate to protect each of itself and any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Corporation, a constituent corporation, or a Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of one of such entities as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation shall have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Section 6.5 and the laws of the State of Delaware. To the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such current or former director, officer or employee, and each such agent or fiduciary to which rights of indemnification have been provided pursuant to paragraph (H) of this Section 6.5, shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for any such current or former director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary.
