EXHIBIT INDEX
 

 
Exhibit 99
HARTFORD, Conn., October 20, 2010  United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today reported third quarter 2010 earnings per share of $1.30 and net income attributable to common shareowners of $1.2 billion, up 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively, over the year ago third quarter. Results for the current and prior year quarters included net charges for restructuring and one time items of $0.09 and $0.13 per share, respectively. Before these charges, earnings per share increased 9 percent year over year. Currency hedges at Pratt & Whitney Canada, net of foreign exchange translation, contributed $0.02 to the earnings per share increase.
Revenues of $13.5 billion for the quarter were 1 percent above prior year with 3 points of organic growth and 1 point of adverse foreign currency translation. Segment operating margin at 16.1 percent was 160 basis points higher than prior year. Adjusted for restructuring and one time items, segment operating margin of 16.3 percent was 90 basis points higher than prior year. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion and, after capital expenditures of $177 million, substantially exceeded net income attributable to common shareowners.
"UTC's results this quarter reflect solid operating leverage with strong conversion on organic revenue growth," said Louis Chnevert, UTC Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "Sustained and structural cost reduction actions drove record segment operating margin, while we increased our investment in new game changing technologies. Cash generation continued to be exceptional, and we made additional contributions of $350 million to our domestic pension plans.
"Based on the strong year to date performance, we are raising 2010 earnings per share guidance to $4.70, the high end of our prior range of $4.60 to $4.70, while increasing restructuring, net of one time items, by $100 million," Chnevert added. "As expected, commercial aerospace aftermarket orders have rebounded nicely but the commercial construction markets remain weak. Additional restructuring will further position us for solid earnings growth in the years ahead."
 
New equipment orders at Otis were down 1 percent over the year ago third quarter. Commercial HVAC new equipment orders at Carrier grew 3 percent including unfavorable foreign exchange of 1 point. Commercial spares orders at Pratt & Whitney's large engine business grew 35 percent and at Hamilton Sundstrand were up 13 percent over the year ago third quarter.
"We expect 2010 earnings per share will grow 14 percent over 2009 on revenues of $54 billion, up 2 percent," Chnevert continued. "We now expect full year cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to exceed 100 percent of net income attributable to common shareowners. UTC's leadership team remains focused on maximizing the potential of our world class franchises and achieving industry leading margins in all of our operating segments."
Share repurchase was $494 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion year to date. Acquisition spend was $183 million in the quarter and $2.6 billion year to date. For the year, UTC expects that share repurchase and acquisition spend will be at least $2 billion and around $3 billion, respectively.

The following page provides segment revenues, operating profits and operating profit margins as adjusted for restructuring and other costs, and the aforementioned non-recurring items. Management believes these adjusted results more accurately portray the ongoing operational performance and fundamentals of the underlying businesses. The amount and timing of restructuring and other costs and non-recurring activity can vary substantially from period to period with no assurances of comparable activity or amounts being incurred in future periods. The amount of restructuring and other costs in 2009 was significantly in excess of that incurred in prior years as well as the levels expected to be incurred in 2010 and reflected the severity of the global recession. These amounts have therefore been adjusted out in the following schedule in order to provide a more representative comparison of current year operating performance to prior year performance.

Free Cash Flow Reconciliation
 
 
 
Free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, is the principal cash performance measure used by the Corporation. Management believes free cash flow provides a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the Corporation's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of the Corporation's Common Stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders. Others that use the term free cash flow may calculate it differently. The reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, to free cash flow is above.
