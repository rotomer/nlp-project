Exhibit 99
HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 26, 2011  United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today reported fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share of $1.31, up 14 percent over prior year. Results for the current and prior year quarters included net charges for restructuring and one-time items of $0.03 and $0.08 per share, respectively. Before these charges, earnings per share increased 9 percent year over year. Currency hedges at Pratt & Whitney Canada, net of all foreign exchange translation, contributed $0.02 to the earnings per share increase.
Consolidated sales for the quarter of $14.9 billion were 6 percent above prior year, including 6 percent of organic growth. Net income attributable to common shareowners of $1.2 billion increased 12 percent year over year. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, including $600 million of global pension contributions. Capital expenditures were $386 million in the quarter.
Full year earnings per share of $4.74 and net income attributable to common shareowners of $4.4 billion increased 15 and 14 percent, respectively, from 2009 results. Consolidated sales of $54.3 billion were 4 percent above prior year including organic growth (2 points), net acquisitions (1 point), and foreign currency translation (1 point). On a reported basis, segment operating margin at 14.6 percent was 140 basis points higher than prior year, with five of six segments above 10 percent operating margins. Adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, segment operating margin of 15.4 percent was 100 basis points higher than prior year. Cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion, including $1.3 billion of global pension contributions. Capital expenditures were $865 million for the year.
"UTC's fourth quarter results reflect strong sales growth, particularly in the commercial aerospace aftermarket and shorter cycle Carrier businesses," said Louis Chnevert, UTC Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "Our proactive focus on structural cost reduction resulted in solid conversion on higher sales and exceptional margin expansion for the year. For the first time in UTC's history, all six business units delivered double digit operating margins for the full year, adjusted for restructuring and one-time items. In typical UTC fashion, cash generation was strong in the quarter and throughout the year."
New equipment orders at Otis were up 11 percent over the year ago fourth quarter. Commercial HVAC new equipment orders at Carrier grew 21 percent including favorable foreign exchange of 1 point. Commercial spares orders at Pratt & Whitney's large engine business grew 45 percent and at Hamilton Sundstrand were up 31 percent over the year ago fourth quarter.
"End markets are recovering consistent with our expectations, supporting our 2011 sales outlook of $56 billion to $57 billion," Chnevert continued. "We expect our strong operating leverage will drive further margin expansion and will allow us to deliver earnings growth of 7 percent to 13 percent with 2011 earnings per share of $5.05 to $5.35, even as we increase investment in transformational technologies.
"We again expect cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to equal or exceed net income attributable to common shareowners in 2011. Share repurchase is expected to be $2.5 billion and our acquisition placeholder is $1.5 billion," Chnevert added.
Share repurchase in the fourth quarter was $556 million and totaled $2.2 billion for the year. Acquisition spending was $207 million in the quarter and $2.8 billion for the year.

The following page provides segment net sales, operating profits and operating profit margins as adjusted for the aforementioned non-recurring items, restructuring and other costs. Management believes these adjusted results more accurately portray the ongoing operational performance and fundamentals of the underlying businesses. The amount and timing of restructuring and other costs and non-recurring activity can vary substantially from period to period with no assurances of comparable activity or amounts being incurred in future periods. The amount of restructuring and other costs in 2009 was significantly in excess of that incurred in prior years as well as the levels incurred in 2010 and reflected the severity of the global recession. These amounts have therefore been adjusted out in the following schedule in order to provide a more representative comparison of current year operating performance to prior year operating performance.

Free Cash Flow Reconciliation
 
Free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, is the principal cash performance measure used by UTC. Management believes free cash flow provides a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing UTC's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of UTC's common stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders. Other companies that use the term free cash flow may calculate it differently. The reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, to free cash flow is shown above.
