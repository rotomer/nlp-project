Merger
At the effective time of the Merger (the ""), each share of Goodrich common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held by Goodrich, UTC, Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive $127.50 in cash, without interest (the "").
Effective Time
Per Share Merger Consideration
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each option to purchase Goodrich common stock outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the total number of shares of Goodrich common stock subject to such option and (2) the amount by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share, less any applicable taxes. As of the Effective Time, all other Goodrich equity and equity-based awards, subject to time-based or performance-based vesting conditions, will vest and be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for under their terms in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
The purchase price is expected to be financed with a combination of new debt, equity or equity-linked securities and cash on UTC's balance sheet. UTC executed a commitment letter, dated September 21, 2011, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, HSBC Bank plc, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., that provides a 12-month commitment, subject to a 6-month extension for regulatory reasons, for a $15 billion 364-day unsecured bridge loan facility. UTC is expected to be assuming $1.9 billion of Goodrich's outstanding debt.
The completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation, (1) the approval of the Merger by Goodrich's stockholders; (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (3) the receipt of other required antitrust approvals, (4) the absence of any order, law or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing or prohibiting completion of the Merger, (5) the absence of certain governmental actions and (6) the absence of a material adverse effect on Goodrich.
The Merger Agreement includes detailed representations, warranties and covenants of Goodrich, UTC and Merger Sub. Between the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, Goodrich has agreed to operate its business and the business of its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, to use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business organizations and business relationships and to comply with certain other operating covenants.
In addition, Goodrich has agreed not to, and not to permit its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives to, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any third-party acquisition proposals, and has agreed to restrictions on its, its subsidiaries' and their respective representatives' ability to respond to any such proposals. Subject to certain exceptions, each of Goodrich, UTC and Merger Sub has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated. The Merger Agreement includes termination provisions for both UTC and Goodrich and provides that, in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Goodrich will be required to pay UTC a termination fee of $500 million.
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.
The representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made only for the purposes of that agreement and solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, as well as by information contained in each party's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. In addition, such representations and warranties (1) will not survive consummation of the Merger and cannot be the basis for any claims under the Merger Agreement by the other party after termination of the Merger Agreement except as a result of a willful and material breach and (2) were made only as of the dates specified in the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the parties or their respective businesses.
 
On September 21, 2011, UTC and Goodrich issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement. A copy of the joint press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In addition, on September 22, 2011, UTC provided supplemental information regarding the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in connection with a presentation and a webcast with analysts and investors. Copies of the presentation and the transcript of the webcast are attached as Exhibit 99.2 and Exhibit 99.3 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.
Forward Looking Statements
This Form 8-K contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute "forward-looking statements" under the securities laws. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied in forward looking statements are described in UTC's Form 10-K and 10-Q Reports under the headings "Business", "Risk Factors", "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Cautionary Note Concerning Factors that May Affect Future Results", as well as the information included in UTC's Current Reports on Form 8-K. Additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the Merger not being timely completed, if completed at all; prior to the completion of the Merger, UTC's and/or Goodrich's respective businesses experiencing disruptions due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors making it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, business partners or governmental entities; and the parties being unable to successfully implement integration strategies. While UTC and/or Goodrich may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, UTC and Goodrich specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if estimates change and, therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.

F I N A L T R A N S C R I P T
Sep. 22. 2011 / 12:30PM, UTXUnited Technologies to Acquire Goodrich Corporation Conference Call
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Good morning. We have exciting times at UTC. You always ask me about M&A and when are we going to do a deal and I've always answered that we have a disciplined approach to M&A. It has to be strategic to the core, it has to be in growth market, there's got to be the ability to apply the UTC model and exercise the synergies and its also got to be the right value. Goodrich perfectly fits these criteria and more. As you know, we've reached an agreement to acquire Goodrich, subject to usual closing conditions. Goodrich is a well-established position in aerospace systems with products that are largely complementary to Hamilton Sundstrand as well as Pratt & Whitney.
Aftermarket content is attractive and like UTC, more than 40% of sales end with high growth expectation, so the timing is also very good. I'm bullish on aerospace and the whole team is bullish on aerospace. It's one of the few areas with a brighter outlook today. Goodrich, again, like UTC, is well-positioned with higher content on many new platforms. We're very excited to bring capabilities of 2 great companies together, making us more competitive, yielding significant value to both customers and our shareholders. We've got seasoned management teams, we've got similar culture, strong focus on growth, productivity and margin expansion, and the opportunity to apply the UTC model and coupled with ACE, our lean manufacturing discipline to further drive performance.There's excellent fit from nose to tail.
Goodrich brings complementary product lines such as wheels and brakes, landing gears, nacelles, actuation and lighting systems. It's a great addition to Hamilton Sundstrand's strong suit of products with electric systems, environmental control systems and engine control systems. The combination will significantly increase our systems offering to air framers and allow greater integration across the platform, just as we did with the Hamilton systems on the 787.We reduced the wirings, the component, created value for the customers and for our shareholders and contributed to lower weight and fuel efficiency for these new aircraft.Timing is good as well.The aerospace sector is poised for upswing. Over a long period, air traffic has grown consistently.
RPMs increased 6% annually for the last 40 years and they're expected to grow 5% for the next 20 years, supported by economic growth in emerging markets. Emerging market trends and replacement of older fleets also drive demand for these new aircraft. As you all know, Boeing's estimate 33,500 new airplane deliveries from 2011 through 2030, compared with less than 20,000 in the last 20 years. Both Hamilton and Goodrich have high content on these new platforms. One of the questions we've asked ourselves, why increase defense exposure in this environment? And I've got Marshall here this morning to talk about the very strong position Goodrich has in this segment.
Marshall LarsenGoodrich CorporationChairman, President & CEO
Thanks, Louis. About 30% of our sales are in defense and space within a very strong portfolio. First, we have a very broad presence and are not dependent in any 1 or 2 large programs. Second, we have a core business in priority areas such as electro-optical surveillance systems, precision guided systems, helicopter programs and the JSF; areas that are least likely to be impacted, even in the face of tighter defense budgets. In fact, our defense and space sales were up 8% organically in the first half of this year. Finally, even with programs that are ending, like the F-22, there is meaningful aftermarket sales for the foreseeable future. And as Louis said, just like UTC, Goodrich has a very strong aftermarket.
43% of our sales come from the aftermarket and we have a very broad base of content on in-service platforms and even higher content on the new platforms. Air framers are increasing production rates driving substantial growth for current aircraft in production which will mature and lead to a solid aftermarket. And, new platforms like the 787, the A350, the Embraer 190, the A320 NEO with the GTF, MRJ, and C-series are coming market. Goodrich is on all those new platforms, and in fact, we have more content on those platforms then on the platforms we are replacing. So, broad positions and higher content a new platforms will drive sustainable, long-term aftermarket growth.With that, let me hand it back to Louis to talk about how this combination adds great value to our customers.

F I N A L T R A N S C R I P T
Sep. 22. 2011 / 12:30PM, UTXUnited Technologies to Acquire Goodrich Corporation Conference Call
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
As we saw with the 787, customers are looking for substantial improvements in the next-generation aircraft.The trends are for more electric, more integrated and more intelligent aircraft. Combination of the UTC and Goodrich capabilities will create offerings such as more electric braking, integrated propulsion systems and vehicle health monitoring systems.These will provide systems with better performance and reliability, reduce complexity and maintenance for the end-users and lower overall cost to our customers. And, we will provide better value to airlines by leveraging Hamilton Sundstrand's recently opened 24/7 world-class customer response center.
Customers will also benefit from expanded aftermarket network and excellent field support. Although we do not include sales synergies in our business case for M&A, we fully expect additional sales synergy as we leverage the capabilities of the 2 world-class product development, sales and aftermarket organizations. I'll come back and answer some questions you might have, but for now, let me hand it off to Greg to briefly talk about the synergies and valuation.
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Good morning, everyone.Thanks, Louis. As we always talk about with these deals, the focus here is on real cost synergies. And similar to previous transactions like GE Security and the Sundstrand deal we did 10 years ago, we haven't included any sales synergies in our model, but we fully expect that this combination will eventually result in significant synergies, both on the cost side, as well as the top line.The cost synergies are going to come really from leveraging the combined volumes with our supply chain, rationalizing our facilities, optimizing our production capacity and consolidation of the back office, along with more efficiency in our E&D.We also get the benefits that UTC's typically get from the ACE operating system and along with the lean manufacturing principles that Goodrich has employed, we're going to have a strong focus on low-cost sourcing and low-cost manufacturing.We know how to integrate transactions. I think if you look back to what we've done over time with the fire and security transactions, with GE Security and others, we know how to do this.
We'll have a dedicated team in place, we'll be looking at these synergies every single day.We're confident that this deal will be accretive by the second year and the IRR for this deal is well in excess of our cost of capital.Turning to valuation, price multiples are consistent with similar deals out the marketplace.We plan to use a combination of debt and stock to fund the transaction. Our current thinking is about 75% debt and 25% equity. Obviously, with the equity markets weak like they are today and have been for the last couple of months, the focus right now is on the debt markets. But we recognize we will have to issue equity, probably prior to close.
We're also going to maintain our credit ratings; we've worked very hard to do that.We expect to have a good terms and a stable credit rating. We will be suspending share buyback through 2012 and significantly reducing that in 2013 and 2014; probably cutting it in half to about $1 billion a year.We're also going to take our M&A placeholder, which we typically have at $2 billion a year, and reduce it to $1 billion a year for the next couple of years; in all, things that we think we need to do to help maintain the credit rating. This deal creates value for both Goodrich and UTC shareholders, as well as our customers. The combination of UTC and Goodrich will make UTC a $66 billion Company, based on pro-forma 2011 results, with slightly less than 50% of our sales from the aerospace sector. As Louis said, the aerospace cycle is one of the few growth sectors in these uncertain times and the addition of a premier company, such as Goodrich, will significantly enhance our capabilities in the attractive aerospace systems space and aftermarket.
UTC will remain a well-balanced enterprise with no single business driving more than 1/3 of sales. We remain well-positioned to serve the growing emerging markets with industry-leading franchises, game changing technologies and a seasoned management team focused on execution. Just to remind everyone of the principles we use in M&A, as Louis said at the start, we look for companies that are in the core, that are in growth markets, and have real synergies and create significant share owner value. The Goodrich acquisition should be no surprise to any of our share owners. We followed the principles in the Sundstrand acquisition, the Carriers acquisition of Linde, and as we built the fire and security segment through the acquisitions

of Chubb, Kidde and recently, GE Security and we'll create value again with the Goodrich acquisition. Let's stop there and open up the call for questions if we could.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.
Doug HarnedSanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.Analyst
Could you walk through how you think about the different sources  I'm assuming cost is the main thing that you've done this deal on. Could you walk through the different elements of that and what the relative size of different cost saving areas are likely to be?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Sure. As we size the cost synergies, we think about 6% of the Goodrich cost base will result in synergies here. So we're thinking about $350 million to $400 million of synergies on a run rate basis. A little over $100 million is going to come from the SG&A, about $100 million from facilities, another $100 million from materials, and then a little bit from R&D and overhead. Again, I would tell you we think this is a very conservative estimate of these synergies. Alain Bellemare and Marshall will be working closely over the coming months to finalize these plans and get the integration teams working, but we think this $350 million to $400 million ought to be a slam dunk from a synergies standpoint.
Doug HarnedSanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.Analyst
Now if you look longer-term, I would assume that the efforts that you've done in sourcing in low-cost countries, Goodrich has been moving in that same direction, but you've done this quite extensively at UTC. Is this an area that you have also looked at here and attach some value to longer term?
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Yes, definitely. As you know, we're not afraid of big goals at UTC and we have a good track record with our ACE operating system, with our supply chain also involved with the ACE operating system, as well as low-cost sourcing. It's substantial opportunities and we have leadership that knows how to do this. I think on the Goodrich side, there's also good leadership that knows how to do this and I think working jointly together, we'll be able to leverage what's already in place on both sides and optimize how we bring it together and create the value for the end customer, as well as for our shareholders.
Doug HarnedSanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.Analyst
And then if I can, you've looked at Goodrich for quite some time.Why now? What's different today than what you saw 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago?

Sep. 22. 2011 / 12:30PM, UTXUnited Technologies to Acquire Goodrich Corporation Conference Call
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Well, I think it's been on our radar screen. Big deals are lumpy, it's not always easy to connect the seller with the buyers. We have very stringent criteria. It had to be in the core, it had to be that we could apply our model synergies. If you look, my last big deal was the GE Security which turned out to be accretive in year 1. We are very proud of what it did to our property.This is one, clearly, was on the radar screen and I think it's been in the works for over a year between Marshall and I.
If you go back even in George's day, George had sometime Goodrich on his slides. So it's not new news that there was interest on our part. It's just that it kind of converged and where the time where we're early in the up cycle all the air framers have announced more volume on production of 73, on 320. I think our shareholders and our customers are going to like this a lot, that we have a brand-new set of capabilities and a bright future with this property after we close.
Doug HarnedSanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.Analyst
Okay, thank you.

Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on the transaction.
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Thanks, Carter.
Carter CopelandBarclays CapitalAnalyst
Just really a couple quick accounting questions for Greg and/or Scott.With respect to the differences in accounting and contract accounting that you guys use at Goodrich, Scott, when we look at the capitalized balance of excess over average and inventory, what should we be thinking are the duration of those contracts and when was the plan to begin working down that balance as opposed to adding to it? That's the first one. And the second is, do you have a sense of what sort of incremental amortization of intangibles you expect to see as a result of the deal?
Scott KuechleGoodrich CorporationEVP & CFO
Sure, Greg. This is Scott. I'd be happy to just comment on the contract accounting piece. First of all, we've got a lot of work to do over the next 6 to 8 months as we work to integrate and work toward closing to determine how we're going to handle things like this. So, all I can speak to is the Goodrich side. We' re going to work on accounting policies, et cetera, going forward so we'll give you more information as we get closer to closing. But our view is that we're about at the peak level this year, next year, in terms of what we put on the balance sheet in contract accounting, as we have a large number of production programs where we're finishing up the pre-production R&D phase.
And then, as we start to get into production on things like 787, there'll be some excess over average in the early stages and that will work down quickly as we start to reach our cost targets over the next couple of years. So, we're looking at $200 million to

F I N A L T R A N S C R I P T
Sep. 22. 2011 / 12:30PM, UTXUnited Technologies to Acquire Goodrich Corporation Conference Call
$300 million this year of additional, non-product inventory excess over average and that should start to work down over the next several years as we get more mature in production and as some of these programs complete.
Carter CopelandBarclays CapitalAnalyst
Do you have a sense of the average duration of those contracts? 5 years, 10 years?
Scott KuechleGoodrich CorporationEVP & CFO
Some of those contracts go out 20 years. It's all over the map, based on different production programs.
Carter CopelandBarclays CapitalAnalyst
Okay, great.
Marshall LarsenGoodrich CorporationChairman, President & CEO
This is Marshall, Carter. One of the things that I think this combination does, it helps us totally rationalize our supply chain and our low cost country manufacturing and should help us move down that cost curve even faster.
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Carter, just to give you some of the numbers in terms of the amortization. First year, obviously, there's going to be some step up of the fixed assets and such and it's probably about $0.30 of impact from the first year amortization. That goes down to about a $0.15 a year average run rate. I think the other good news is that, again, as we conform Goodrich's accounting to UTC's accounting, we'll probably move away from the contract accounting that Goodrich has done over the last 10 years or so.What that does is give us an opportunity to probably get some of these costs behind us that have been capitalized. We'll take care of that in purchase accounting.The good news is, as Scott and Marshall were saying, we're coming down the curve quickly on the 787. That's probably the biggest issue that we've got out there, but we've looked and we're confident in Goodrich's plans on cost reduction and getting to a break even on that program relatively quickly.
Carter CopelandBarclays CapitalAnalyst
That's great.Thank you very much. Congratulations again.
Operator
George Shapiro, Access 342.
George ShapiroAccess 342Analyst
Just one follow-up on the accounting, there's also a difference in pension. Goodrich was able to move away from the high pension costs because you had something over whatever the exact number is, 80% of the people not on defined benefit anymore. How's that going to get affected in the combination here?

F I N A L T R A N S C R I P T
Sep. 22. 2011 / 12:30PM, UTXUnited Technologies to Acquire Goodrich Corporation Conference Call
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
We'll conform to the pension accounting to UTC methodology. It's not a big number for us. We think, as we look at Goodrich's pension funding, there's about 90% or so right now, I think, at a 5% discount rate. We'll see where the discount rates end up, but we don't anticipate a big impact from the pension as we conform it to UTC's plan.
George ShapiroAccess 342Analyst
And then, the other question, Greg, in terms of just to clarify, you're going to totally suspend the buyback next year so you're not going to even by shares to offset option and share creep? That share creep number is what, 8 million or 9 million shares a year?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
It's a little bit less than that, but typically we have to buy back about $500 million year to cover the dilution associated with option exercise. So, we'll see a little bit of a headwind from that next year. Again, it's all in the numbers as we look at accretion dilution for the next couple of years. Obviously, next year it's a bigger number as we take all the deal costs, we take the restructuring charges, take the amortization associated with the intangibles, but still solidly accretive by year 2.
George ShapiroAccess 342Analyst
Okay, thanks a lot and congratulations to both of you.
Operator
Cai von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.
Cai von RumohrCowen and CompanyAnalyst
Yes, thank you and let me join in congratulations. Could you give us some color? You haven't talked about potential regulatory hurdles and you haven't talked about your customers' reaction. Is the EU going to think this is okay? Is China going to think this is okay? Do Boeing and Airbus think this is okay?
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Well, Cai, that's a very good question and good morning. Simply said, a lot of the Goodrich product line is complementary to what we do. We don't have landing gears and brakes, we don't have nacelles today. I talked to several European customers this morning before this call and I would say the level of energy and enthusiasm was very good from the customer. So, I think this is something we've done, acquisitions, before we know to do this and touch every customer worldwide and they know our culture.
I think they like the UTC culture of how we deliver on time. We optimize value for them. So, I expect minimal issues in the whole process. We' re going to do that by working our customers and making sure they're comfortable with our game plan.
Cai von RumohrCowen and CompanyAnalyst
Okay. What sort of timetable should we think about this thing happening on?

Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
I think most likely somewhere by the end of Q2 12 or Q3 is probably the reasonable timing that we expect.
Cai von RumohrCowen and CompanyAnalyst
Okay, a last quick one  in your cost savings, I can understand SG&A and facilities. Help me understand how, combined, you get $100 million in material savings that you couldn't get individually?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Cai, that's really just a question of leveraging the global supply contracts that we have and the global sourcing. Again, Goodrich is an $8 billion company, UTC is a $58 billion company. You put the two of us together and we just think there are natural opportunities, and we've actually identified some of those in due diligence, that give us high confidence that we can take about 3% of the cost out on the procurement side relatively quickly.
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
You've got to remember, Cai, we buy the same types of material whether it's titanium, nickel alloy, bearings, et cetera. All of a sudden, we aggregate all these after closing and it simplifies the relationship between us and the supply chain.We're going to certainly do that and more, in my view, as we move forward.
Cai von RumohrCowen and CompanyAnalyst
Terrific.Thank you very much.

Howard Rubel, Jefferies.
Howard RubelJefferies & CompanyAnalyst
Thank you, good morning. Quite an exciting deal. Just a couple of follow-up questions  first, for Greg, when you talk about the accretion in year 2, can you give us a sense of what that means? Where you got the number?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Obviously, I'm not prepared today to give you the exact numbers for the dilution in year 1 and the accretion going forward, but clearly, as we work through this, and we've taken a look at the deal costs, we've taken a look at the synergy rollout, we're going to have solid accretion in year 2, primarily just from realizing the benefits on the SG&A and the overhead side initially.The supply chain will take a little bit longer to realize and the facilities rationalization even a little bit further.We probably get the full run rate synergies after about 4 years and obviously, the facilities are the long pole in the tent there.
Howard RubelJefferies & CompanyAnalyst
What kind of cost of money did you assume in this? Is it kind of in the 4% range?

Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
In fact, it's even a little bit better than that. We're going to go to the market and probably borrow about $12 billion of the $16 billion purchase price. Most of that is going to be front-loaded on the yield curve. We'll do some 10-year, probably $3 billion, we'll probably do some 30-year, but most of this is going to be paid off in the first 5 years. If you think about it, we're generating over $5 billion of free cash flow ourselves every year.
Without the burden of share buyback in the first year or so, we'll be able to pay this debt down relatively quickly. Overall interest cost that we've assumed for accretion dilution is just a little bit south of 3% in total for the $12 billion of borrowing.
Howard RubelJefferies & CompanyAnalyst
That's why I'm a little surprised about the equity, given the free cash flow, Greg.
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Well, again, we've said this in the past, keeping the credit rating, especially in times like this, it is sacrosanct. It is kind of like the dividend. We're never going to lose it. We worked very closely with the rating agencies. We knew that we had to do a little bit in terms of equity to hold the rating, we knew we had to suspend share buyback, but again, the deal makes sense, even with the issuance of 25% equity. In fact, it makes a heck of a lot of sense.

Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the deal. Louis or Marshall, could you comment a bit about the culture between the companies? Oftentimes when you have deals of this size, that tends to make or break it. Do you think the workforce at Hamilton and Goodrich effectively are kind of prepared for it? Also, from a perspective of integration of the cultures, how soon after deal closure would you anticipate starting to blend the businesses together? Slide 10 in your chart show them more or less operating independent from one another, at least at the beginning.When do they start to blend and mesh together?
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Let me start. Certainly, the cultures of the enterprise are quite similar and that's part of the attractiveness of this property. Not only do they have a great product portfolio, but the culture of ethics, of productivity, the culture of serving the customers, I think it's going to be very complementary. After closing, obviously, it's our intent, although the slide shows these businesses side-by-side, the fact is, the leadership of the Sundstrand business will then be very closely integrated in Charlotte to drive the maximum synergies, to drive maximum opportunity in front of us and I think that it's going to be a happy transition, in my view, as we move forward. The team, as you know, always in the UTC culture as we have the right formulas for incentive comp, for long-term incentives, to drive profound execution. I'm totally convinced that as their team joins our team, they're going to like the culture of enterprise and not only the prior track record, but going forward, the opportunities we have together.

Sep. 22. 2011 / 12:30PM, UTXUnited Technologies to Acquire Goodrich Corporation Conference Call
Marshall LarsenGoodrich CorporationChairman, President & CEO
I would echo that. I think the blending of our 2 cultures is extremely important and during this time period where we've gotten to know, Louis and United Technologies better, we've come to the belief that our cultures are not different. That we really respect the individual, we treat our employees well, we have accountability and teamwork and we, as Louis said, highly value our ethical culture and that is not going to change because we're working together.
Myles WaltonDeutsche BankAnalyst
Louis, from a perspective of a competitor and customer of Goodrich, previously, or a partner in a lot of places, you probably have a read into measuring where they are on the ACE spectrum. As you look at it today, where do they stack up relative to the mix, gold, silver, at Hamilton?
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Number one, is they have a very good culture, also, of continuous improvement and kaizen process et cetera.While it's, perhaps, slightly different than what we have, I think our ACE system is more comprehensive. I think they might come up the learning curve fairly quickly after closing.We're going to put some ACE experts in there to make sure that we train their workforce. But it's not going to be culture shock. That's the good news because they already have that embedded in them of continuous improvement.
I see a lot of good momentum developing quickly and I would say as far as where they are today, well, obviously any new facility that comes on our system starts at pre-qualifying, but I think that will make it up the ladder fairly quickly to bronze and to silver. There's many facilities that I've been briefed on by Marshall and his team that appear to be at a very high level of performance. Some others, like any company, have a world of opportunities in front of him. We are going to implement our approach, but it's all going to be very good.
Marshall LarsenGoodrich CorporationChairman, President & CEO
The good news about continuous improvement through lean manufacturing or the ACE system at United Technologies is you never stop improving. And so, regardless of the level of any facility, we always find more ways to improve it. In fact, you know, and I've talked to our investors in the past, about the lean events that we do, we'll go back to a facility or a portion of a facility a year or 2 later and find even more ways to improve it. I think we have an opportunity in the 2 companies as we come together to learn the best practices on both sides.
Myles WaltonDeutsche BankAnalyst
Good.Thanks again and congratulations.

Congratulations as well. The $500 million in costs, one-time P&L costs that you show on slide 8, Greg, is that all purchase accounting? Is that taking care of the capitalized costs? Does that include restructuring? What exactly all is in that number?

Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
That is all of the costs that actually are going to hit the P&L over the first couple of years. So, that's primarily restructuring-related costs, which can no longer go into purchase accounting. It's not, unfortunately, the good old days where you could take all that restructuring in the first year and bang it into the balance sheet. It's all got to get charged to the P&L. So, the lion's share of that is restructuring.
David StraussUBSAnalyst
Okay. Would you expect, as part of trying to close this deal, would you expect to have to make any divestitures? Obviously, there is some overlap in terms of power systems and engine controls between 2 businesses?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
We've done a pretty thorough analysis. Obviously, we've had good counsel from the antitrust guys at Wachtell Lipton, as well as our internal guys take a look at this. And for the most part, we think all of these businesses are complementary. Obviously, you point out there a couple of small overlaps, we're not anticipating any significant divestitures at all. We are obviously anticipating a second request from justice which will take the close out probably about 9 months. But really not anticipating anything in terms of significant divestitures.
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
And as I said in my opening remarks, some of their large businesses, we don't have today. Nacelle systems is not a business of ours today, landing gears and brakes, for those, there is absolutely no issues and there's just a couple tiny areas that we're going to work aggressively and it's all in our relationship also with the customers and how they see us creating the value for them in the future.We're going to work this aggressively over the next couple of months.
David StraussUBSAnalyst
Okay. And last one for me  Louis and Greg, in terms of timing doing this deal today, should we read anything into it in terms of a more difficult outlook as you look at your non-aerospace, res and commercial construction businesses as you look out to 2012 and maybe even 2013? Just a more difficult outlook there as compared to what you might have thought 3 to 6 months ago?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
No. We're very confident in the guidance that we've given for the year. We still remain well-positioned to grow earnings into the next couple of years. Look, the markets are difficult, we see it every day in the US and in Western Europe. But we're well-positioned, as Louis said, in the emerging markets and in the growth markets. As we've always said, deals happen when they happen.The stars have aligned perfectly here.We're very fortunate to be able to come together with Goodrich today and really, timing is just what it is.
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Nothing has changed to what we've said before as far as the current status of business. We still see a lot of momentum in emerging markets. We still see the same parameters, deals happen when they happen.The way I look at this is, I've got a long road ahead of me.This is a target property that was a fabulous, basically complementary property to ours.

I look at it from we're going to love this property, 10, 20 years out. This is always going to be a superb fit and we're going to create value for our customers and shareholders. It's unfortunate, you can't pick the day where you announce these things. But guess what, it's a great deal; it's always going to be a fabulous deal as we move forward.

In your prepared remarks, Louis, you mentioned that it would make both companies more competitive. If you could speak to where do you think you could get some revenue synergies specifically, be it that there isn't a lot of overlap? What areas do you think you could find that?
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Well, I think what happens is a bit of what you saw in the Hamilton Sundstrand story. Because we had Sundstrand, when came a new platform that demands more efficiency, more integration, there's no doubt in my mind, we did a lot more on a single platform then the companies would have done on their own because we could integrate systems and create value for customers. Well, guess what, there's inside in a nacelle is an engine and one of the things we could do, for example, that will enhance the value for the end customer as we bring those businesses together, the same is true with the landing gear and brakes system and basically conveying the right messages in cockpit and all that. I think we're going to find ways, basically on all the new platforms of the future to see more volume, more business than the individual business would have seen individually or separately.
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Ron, keep in mind, too, our base case does not include any revenue synergies. I think that's all upside. Is a long-term play, but it is clearly upside to any of the valuation models that we've done.
Ron EpsteinBofA Merrill LynchAnalyst
How big could that possibly be if we try to think about how to scope that out? Down the road, longer-term how could big could the revenue synergies be?
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
Well, let me just say, this is for another day, we'll discuss that. We're going to go and focus on closing this property first. We've got to understand the business, exercise the synergies and this will be icing on the cake when it all happens. But we need new platforms, we need new opportunities, but they will come. Aerospace is going to grow, as well as there will be a lot of things we could do across the businesses leveraging the E&D and being more competitive in how we package solutions, et cetera.

Sep. 22. 2011 / 12:30PM, UTXUnited Technologies to Acquire Goodrich Corporation Conference Call
Ron EpsteinBofA Merrill LynchAnalyst
And then just one last question if I may  one that you actually brought up.Why increase defense here? I think we all know that Goodrich's defense business has been producing well. But the backdrop for defense is, without a doubt, is getting more difficult, right? How do you think about that risk, particularly longer-term?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Clearly, as we looked at the Goodrich portfolio, one-third of the revenues do come from the defense side. But I think, as Marshall explained before, their portfolio is uniquely positioned, especially in what they call the ISR, the intelligence surveillance recon-type mission.They've got great, great technologies. It's a lot of small programs, and we all understand defense spending is going to be cut and we factored that into our valuation analysis. But as we look at the portfolio across Goodrich, it really will probably withstand the test of time here as we go through this process down in Washington.
Marshall LarsenGoodrich CorporationChairman, President & CEO
Ron, if you think about the Goodrich defense portfolio, Greg just gave you some prime examples of why it's kind of in a lot of the sweet spots of what will be funded. But you can also think of it in the other way  what things aren't being funded? Like navy ship programs, ground vehicles, all parts of the defense portfolio that we don't play in, where we won't get whacked in a general cut across the board. So we feel very good about our defense portfolio being able to continue to move on and grow.
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
They also have nice content, if I could wrap it up here, on many of the new platforms that are essential to the DoD like the JSF, like the 53 kilo, et cetera, that is going to be a nice run, also, of new platforms for the future.
Ron EpsteinBofA Merrill LynchAnalyst
Great. Congratulations and thanks.

Just a question, the C919, how does this combination position you on that platform? Would you be able to get more content there? And are there any regulatory approvals that you need in China?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Right now, obviously, Hamilton Sundstrand will be supplying the electric power distribution for the C919. We don't see there being a regulatory issue in terms of MOFCOM approval with the Chinese. Obviously, technology transfer and ITAR restrictions are first and foremost in our minds here, but we don't see a big issue there.

Ajay KejriwalFBR Capital MarketsAnalyst
Good. And then Louis, this acquisition gets Hamilton above the $10 billion mark and that would leave basically just Fire & Security and Sikorsky below $10 billion. Is it fair to assume that future acquisition dollars would be those 2 segments?
Louis ChenevertUnited Technologies Corp.Chairman, CEO
I think it's very premature to comment at all on this. Obviously, I love $10 billion business, but here, obviously, we've made a giant step in the right direction. I think there is some small property still around for Fire & Security in the future, but for now, our focus is clearly on execution. Greg mentioned earlier, we're going to minimize our M&A pool for the next couple of years, from where it is. At the same time, our goal is always to outperform and basically, it's very, very premature to talk about anything else.We're going to do this transaction, we're going to bring it to closure, and our customers, shareholders will love the outcome.

A couple of follow-ups on the numbers  the amortization in 2013 is going to be I guess around $200 million. In terms of this ramp on the synergies, is there enough that hits in 13 to offset the incremental amortization? Maybe a little more on how that flows through?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
Pretty close by year 2 offsetting the amortization. We still, of course, have some restructuring costs.That $500 million restructuring costs will play itself out over a few years, so you still have a hit from that, as well as the interest cost. But, clearly, you get solid accretion in year 2.
Shannon O'CallaghanNomura Securities IntlAnalyst
Okay, and then, in year 1, just help me out there. $0.30 of amortization, I think you used the word dilutive for 12, what are the other big chunks in 12? How much of that is a big chunk of the $500 million going to hit right away? Or what else is there besides $0.30 of amortization?
Greg HayesUnited Technologies Corp.SVP/CFO
You do have restructuring costs the first year. Actually, restructuring costs will probably ramp up into the second and third year as we look at the facility rationalization.You also have all of the deal costs, which will hit us when we close; the cost of issuing the securities and the debt and just a few other costs.You've also got, of course, the impact of not doing share buyback and so we factored that into the equation as well. But, look, it will be a one-time hit.We'll get in front of that number, we'll talk to you before Louis stands up in December and we'll give you some clear guidance on what that'll be. But probably take a couple more weeks to sort through it.
