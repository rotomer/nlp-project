Exhibit 99
HARTFORD, Conn., January 25, 2011  United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today reported fourth quarter 2011 earnings per share of $1.47 and net income attributable to common shareowners of $1.3 billion, up 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, over the year ago quarter. Sales of $15.0 billion for the quarter were 1 percent above prior year including 2 points of organic growth and 1 point of net divestitures. Cash flow from operations was $2.0 billion and capital expenditures were $378 million in the quarter.
Results for the quarter included $0.11 per share of restructuring charges, offset by $0.12 of net favorable one-time items. The prior year quarter included charges for restructuring and net one-time items of $0.03 per share. Before these items, earnings per share increased $0.12 or 9 percent year over year. Foreign currency translation net of currency impact at Pratt & Whitney Canada did not have an impact on earnings per share.
Fourth quarter segment operating margin was 14.7 percent. Adjusted for restructuring costs and net one-time items, segment operating margin of 15.4 percent was 20 basis points higher than prior year. Research and development increased year over year by $95 million to $552 million.
Full year earnings per share of $5.49 and net income attributable to common shareowners of $5.0 billion increased 16 and 14 percent, respectively, from 2010. Sales of $58.2 billion were 7 percent above prior year including organic growth (6 points), favorable foreign currency translation (2 points), and net divestitures (1 point). Segment operating margin of 15.4 percent was 80 basis points higher than prior year; adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, segment operating margin of 15.7 percent was 30 basis points higher than prior year. All segments were at or above 10 percent operating margins. Cash flow from operations was $6.6 billion, including $551 million of global pension contributions. Capital expenditures were $983 million for the year. Cash flow from operations less capital expenditures exceeded net income attributable to common shareowners.
"UTC closed a solid 2011 despite tough compares in the commercial aerospace aftermarket and shorter cycle Carrier businesses and significant research and development investment in the quarter," said Louis Chnevert, UTC Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "For the year, all business units grew organically and achieved double digit operating margins. This performance, together with
the announcements to acquire Goodrich and Rolls-Royce's share of the IAE joint venture, positions the company for future earnings growth." Chnevert added, "As expected, cash generation was strong in both the quarter and full year."
New equipment orders at Otis were up 2 percent over the year ago fourth quarter with no impact from foreign exchange. Commercial HVAC new equipment orders at Carrier grew 5 percent excluding 1 point of unfavorable foreign exchange. Commercial spares orders at Hamilton Sundstrand were up 17 percent and at Pratt & Whitney's large engine business declined 16 percent, after growing 45 percent in the year ago fourth quarter.
"We remain confident in our ability to deliver 2012 earnings per share of $5.80 to $6.00, up 6 to 9 percent, for our base business excluding the pending Goodrich transaction, which remains on track to close mid-year," Chnevert stated. "While we see ongoing volatility in foreign exchange rates, we continue to see strength in commercial aerospace and growth in emerging markets.
"We continue to expect sales of between $59 billion and $60 billion and cash flow from operations less capital expenditures to equal or exceed net income attributable to common shareowners for our base business in 2012," Chnevert added.
Acquisition spending was $357 million for the year, of which $128 million was in the fourth quarter. Share repurchase was $2.2 billion for the year, of which none was in the fourth quarter.

The following page provides segment net sales, operating profits and operating profit margins as adjusted for the aforementioned restructuring costs and non-recurring items. Management believes these adjusted results more accurately portray the ongoing operational performance and fundamentals of the underlying businesses. The amount and timing of restructuring costs and non-recurring activity can vary substantially from period to period with no assurances of comparable activity or amounts being incurred in future periods. These amounts have therefore been adjusted out in the following schedule in order to provide a more representative comparison of current year operating performance to prior year performance.
