PROPOSAL 1: AMENDMENTS TO SECTIONS 4.1 AND 4.12 OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
On December 19, 2007, our board of directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving, declaring advisable and recommending to our stockholders for approval, amendments to Sections 4.1 and 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation.
General.
In October 2007, we consummated a reorganization of the global Visa enterprise. Prior to this reorganization, the global Visa enterprise included four major separately incorporated entities: Visa U.S.A., Inc. (which we refer to as Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (which we refer to as Visa International), Visa Canada Association (which we refer to as Visa Canada) and Visa Europe Limited (which we refer to as Visa Europe). Through our reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became our subsidiaries. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc. at the time of the reorganization, but exchanged its membership interest in Visa International and its ownership interest in Inovant, LLC, a majority owned subsidiary of Visa U.S.A., for a minority shareholding in our common stock and other consideration.
Background to Amendments to Sections 4.1 and 4.12.
On November 9, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the SEC) relating to a proposed initial public offering of our class A common stock (which we refer to as our initial public offering). Such registration statement has yet to become effective. During the course of preparing to file our registration statement, our management, aided by our legal and financial advisors, conducted a review of our certificate of incorporation in light of our proposed initial public offering and consulted with the proposed underwriters of our proposed initial public offering regarding any changes to our certificate of incorporation that might be advisable to facilitate the consummation of our proposed initial public offering in an efficient manner that offers the greatest opportunity to provide maximum value to our stockholders. As a result of its review, our management proposed to our board of directors that our board of directors consider making the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation in order to facilitate our proposed initial public offering. After considering the proposed amendments and discussing them with our legal and financial advisors, our board of directors has determined that the amendments described in this proposal are advisable to facilitate our proposed initial public offering and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.
Our certificate of incorporation currently provides that the total number of shares of all classes of stock that we are authorized to issue is 2,004,199,484,030 shares, consisting of:
Amendments to Section 4.1.

The amendments to Section 4.1, if approved by our stockholders, would:
 
 
 
The full text of the proposed amended version of Section 4.1 of our certificate of incorporation, marked to show all changes from those sections currently in effect, is attached as
Appendix A
to this proxy statement.
Our reorganization was consummated in a manner which allowed Visa Europe to be in a position to qualify for the "substantial shareholding" tax exemption under English law. Under English law, a holder of a "substantial shareholding" may be in a position to qualify for an exemption from capital gains tax upon a disposition of those shares if it holds the shares throughout a continuous period of 12 months, beginning not more than 24 months prior to the disposition of such shares. For these purposes, a "substantial shareholding" means shares entitling the holder to not less than 10% of a company's ordinary share capital, not less than 10% of the profits available for distribution to equity holders and not less than 10% of the assets of the company available for distribution to equity holders upon a winding up of the company.
Reasons for the Amendments to Section 4.1.
In order to enable Visa Europe to be in a position to qualify for this exemption, our current certificate of incorporation provides that if, at any time prior to the date that is 369 days after the date on which Inovant Inc. is merged into Visa Inc. in connection with the restructuring, there occurs any transaction or other event as a result of which the shares of our class EU (series I) common stock, class EU (series II) common stock, class EU (series III) common stock, class C (series II) common stock, class C (series III) common stock or class C (series IV) common stock (or the common stock into which any such class EU or class C common stock may convert or has been converted) owned by Visa Europe and Visa Europe Services, Inc., (which we refer to as VESI), would represent, in the aggregate, less than 10% of: (i) our ordinary share capital (within the meaning of Section 832 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988), (ii) our profits available for distribution to our "equity holders" (computed in accordance with Schedule 18 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, as adapted by paragraph 8 Schedule 7AC of the English Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act of 1992, or TCGA), and (iii) the assets that would be available to our equity holders upon our dissolution or other winding up (or any such other event with respect to our share capital occurs as would cause Visa Europe to fail the "substantial shareholding" test as set out in paragraph 8 Schedule 7AC of the TCGA in respect of its holding of shares of common stock), then such transaction or other event will have no effect unless we issue to Visa Europe, prior thereto, a number of shares of our class C (series II) common stock (or class EU (series II) common stock, if prior to the conversion of our class EU (series II) common stock into Class C (series II) common stock) such that, immediately after giving effect to such issuances, the shares of our class EU (series I) common stock, class EU (series II) common stock, class EU (series III) common stock, class C (series II) common stock, class C (series III) common stock and class C (series
 
Table of Contents
IV) common stock (or the common stock into which any such class EU or class C common stock may convert or have been converted) owned by Visa Europe and VESI represent, in the aggregate, at least 10% of: (a) our ordinary share capital, (b) our profits available for distribution to our equity holders and (c) the assets that would be available to our equity holders upon our dissolution or other winding up, such that the test referred to above would be satisfied (we refer to such rights granted to Visa Europe as the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights).
In connection with our proposed initial public offering, we anticipate that we will be required to issue shares of our class A common stock to the underwriters of that offering. As set forth in our certificate of incorporation and the registration statement filed in connection with our proposed initial public offering, we anticipate that a primary use of the proceeds of our proposed initial public offering will be to redeem shares of our outstanding common stock, however, prior to the occurrence of this redemption, we anticipate that as a result of our issuance of shares of our class A common stock to our underwriters in connection with our proposed initial public offering, the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding will increase and such issuance will trigger the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights. All outstanding shares of our class EU (series II) common stock will be converted into shares of our class C (series II) common stock prior to the consummation of our proposed initial public offering. The class C (series II) common stock is subject to redemption in the manner provided by our certificate of incorporation. As indicated in our registration statement, we do not believe that this issuance will have a cash impact or affect our financial results, including earnings per share, as the shares will be classified as temporary equity and will be redeemed together with all other outstanding shares of class C (series II) common stock for a net aggregate price of $1.146 billion (subject to adjustment as described above) on or about October 10, 2008.
In addition, as part of the retrospective responsibility plan implemented in connection with our reorganization and designed to address potential liabilities arising from certain litigation that we refer to as the "covered litigation", we have entered into a litigation management agreement with certain persons who are affiliated with or acting for certain members of Visa U.S.A. The litigation committee has the authority to require us to conduct follow-on offerings of our shares of class A common stock, which we refer to as loss shares, under certain circumstances. Such additional issuances of our shares of class A common stock may trigger the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights. Further, additional circumstances (such as our recent settlement of litigation with American Express) may trigger the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights.
The proposed amendments to Section 4.1 of our certificate of incorporation are intended to ensure that we have sufficient authorized shares of our class EU (series II) common stock and class C (series II) common stock which could be used from time to time, without further action or authorization by our stockholders, except as may be required by our certificate of incorporation, applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which our securities may then be listed, to implement the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights, as more fully described above.
If our stockholders do not approve the proposed amendments to Section 4.1, it may be more difficult or impossible for us to complete our proposed initial public offering or we may be forced to delay our proposed initial public offering or to complete our proposed initial public offering at a lower price or on other terms that are relatively less advantageous to our existing stockholders than the terms that might be available to us if the proposed amendments to Section 4.1 are approved. Among other possible outcomes, the failure to approve the proposed amendments to Section 4.1 may force us to limit the number of shares of class A common stock that we sell to the public in connection with our proposed initial public offering, which would have the effect of limiting the amounts available redeem shares of class B common stock and class C common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation.
We do not intend to seek authorization from stockholders for issuance of additional shares of our class EU (series II) common stock or class C (series II) common stock unless required to do so. At the date of this proxy statement, we have no agreements, commitments or definitive plans, other than the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights, with respect to the sale or issuance of the additional shares of our class EU (series II) common stock or class C (series II) common stock that would be authorized by the proposed amendment.
 
Table of Contents
Each of the class C (series II) common stock and the class EU (series II) common stock is non-voting and, as such, neither the authorization nor the issuance of additional shares of such common stock will have any impact on the proportionate voting power or rights of any stockholder. We do not believe that this issuance will have a cash impact or affect our financial results, including earnings per share, as the shares will be classified as temporary equity and will be redeemed together with all other outstanding class C (series II) common stock for a net aggregate price of $1.146 billion (subject to adjustment as described above) on or about October 10, 2008. To the extent that the additional authorized shares of our class EU (series II) common stock or class C (series II) common stock are issued in the future, such issuance may temporarily decrease existing stockholders' (other than Visa Europe's) percentage equity ownership until such time as the class C (series II) common stock is redeemed as described above).
In general, except for the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights, no holders of any shares of our outstanding capital stock will be entitled to preemptive rights to subscribe for any shares of any class or series of our capital stock (which means that current stockholders other than Visa Europe do not have a prior right to purchase any new issue of common stock in order to maintain their proportionate ownership of common stock). We do not intend to grant preemptive rights by a resolution of our board of directors or through any agreement with our stockholders with respect to any shares of class C (series II) common stock or class EU (series II) common stock issued to Visa Europe pursuant to the Visa Europe Preemptive Rights.
Our certificate of incorporation currently provides that, except with respect to shares of our regional classes of common stock and any shares of class B common stock or class C common stock into which shares of our regional classes of common stock may be converted under certain circumstances, we will not issue any fractional shares of any class of common stock upon conversion of any shares of any other class of common stock into shares of such class. In lieu of fractional shares, we will pay cash equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the fair market value, as determined by or in accordance with procedures established by our board of directors, per share of the applicable class of common stock into which such shares are being converted, as of the conversion date.
Amendments to Section 4.12.
The amendments to Section 4.12, if approved by our stockholders, would implement this determination and would apply the limitation on fractional shares to redemption of any shares of our common stock (in addition to conversion of any shares of our common stock, as more fully described in the immediately preceding sentence). Accordingly, redemption of any shares of our common stock will not result in issuance of fractional shares of any class of our common stock, and in lieu of fractional shares, we will pay cash equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the fair market value, as determined by or in accordance with procedures established by our board of directors, per share of the applicable class of common stock from which such shares are being redeemed on the applicable redemption date.
The full text of the proposed amended version of Section 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation, marked to show all changes from those sections as currently in effect, is attached as
Appendix A
to this proxy statement.
The proposed amendments to Section 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation would eliminate the issuance of fractional shares in connection with redemption of any shares of our common stock. Our board of directors, after consulting with our financial advisors, has determined that the administrative burden and cost to us of issuing and maintaining records with respect to small fractions of shares of our common stock after our proposed initial public offering outweighs any benefits achievable for us or our stockholders from the continued issuance of fractional shares and, accordingly, has determined to redeem for cash any fractional shares resulting from the redemption of shares of our common stock contemplated in connection with our proposed initial public offering. Such elimination of fractional shares will also enable the transfer agent to more efficiently administer the transfer or redemption of such shares of our common stock.
Reasons for the Amendments to Section 4.12.

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of all regional classes of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, voting together as a single class, is required to approve this proposal to amend Sections 4.1 and 4.12 of our certificate of incorporation. If approved, this proposal will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which we intend to do promptly upon obtaining stockholder approval.
