Question
Why are we proposing to amend our certificate of incorporation?
Our certificate of incorporation requires us to redeem shares of our class B common stock and class C common stock (other than class C (series II) common stock) from the holders of those shares using net proceeds of our initial public offering, if and when that initial public offering occurs. Currently our certificate of incorporation requires that this redemption occur in a single tranche and this requirement creates a risk of delay in effecting that redemption due to a need to ascertain that we have collected all proceeds of our initial public offering and accounted for all expenses. We believe that our stockholders wish to have greater certainty about the ability to quickly effect the redemptions required to be completed out of the net proceeds of our initial public offering as quickly as possible after the completion of our initial public offering. The amendments we are proposing will create greater certainty that the a redemption of a all or a substantial portion of the required shares will occur promptly after shares of our capital stock are first sold in our initial public offering.
Answer:
:
Question
Will the proposed amendments change the number of shares that I will have redeemed or the amount of proceeds I will receive?
No. The amendments will not change the number of shares you have redeemed or the amount you will receive. The amendments merely increase the likelihood that you will receive a portion of your redemption more quickly than you would otherwise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation as currently in effect.
Answer:
:
Question
Will any stockholder's redemption proceeds or number of shares redeemed change pursuant to these amendments?
No. The amendments will not change the distribution of proceeds among stockholders or the aggregate number of shares to be redeemed from any stockholder. The amendments merely increase the likelihood that you will receive a portion of your redemption more quickly than you would otherwise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation as currently in effect.

PROPOSAL 1: AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 4.18 OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND CERTAIN RELATED PROVISIONS
On February 20, 2008, our board of directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving, declaring advisable and recommending to our stockholders for approval, amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and certain related provisions.
General.
In October 2007, we consummated a reorganization of the global Visa enterprise. Prior to this reorganization, the global Visa enterprise included four major separately incorporated entities: Visa U.S.A., Inc. (which we refer to as Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (which we refer to as Visa International), Visa Canada Association (which we refer to as Visa Canada) and Visa Europe Limited (which we refer to as Visa Europe). Through our reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became our subsidiaries. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc. at the time of the reorganization, but exchanged its membership interest in Visa International and its ownership interest in Inovant, LLC, a majority owned subsidiary of Visa U.S.A., for a minority shareholding in our common stock and other consideration. In connection with our reorganization we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation.
Background to Amendments to Section 4.18 and Related Provisions.
On November 9, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the SEC) relating to a proposed initial public offering of our class A common stock (which we refer to as our "IPO"). We filed amendments to our registration statement with the SEC on December 21, 2007, on February 4, 2008 and, again, on February 11, 2008. Such registration statement has yet to become effective.
Our certificate of incorporation, as currently in effect provides that we will use a portion of the proceeds of our IPO, if and when it occurs, to redeem shares of our class B common stock and class C common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides for such redemption to be completed in a single tranche, using the net proceeds of our IPO (including the proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters with respect to our IPO). As currently set forth in our certificate of incorporation and assuming that the underwriting agreement in respect of our IPO contains a customary underwriters' overallotment option running thirty days from the date of the underwriting agreement, there exists a risk that such redemption (other than the redemption of shares of class C (series II) common stock, class C (series III) common stock and Class C (series IV) common stock held by Visa Europe Limited, the redemption of which is deferred in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation) would be required to be deferred until we were certain as to whether the underwriters overallotment option had been exercised. This resulted in uncertainty as to the timing of the redemption resulting from the possibility that we would have to wait approximately thirty days to determine the final result of the underwriters' overallotment option. The proposed amendments are intended to reduce or eliminate this uncertainty by allowing us to redeem a portion of the shares required to be redeemed promptly after the first sale of shares in connection with our IPO. Stockholders should note that no assurances can be given as to if, or when, we will consummate an IPO and we may never do so.
Our management recommended to our board of directors that it consider reducing the uncertainty inherent in our certificate of incorporation as currently in effect by amending section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and certain related provisions to permit the redemption contemplated by the certificate of incorporation to be completed in two tranches. On February 20, 2008, after due and careful deliberation and consultation with its legal and financial advisors, the board of directors passed resolutions to approve and adopt the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in the form attached hereto in setting forth amendments to section 4.18 and certain related provisions, and determined such amendments to be advisable and in the best interest of our stockholders and recommended that the stockholders adopt the amendments. Our officers of were thereby directed to submit the amendments to the certificate of incorporation to a vote of our stockholders at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders to be held on March 7, 2008.
Appendix A
 
Our certificate of incorporation currently provides that after the completion of our IPO, we will redeem from the holders of class B common stock and class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock, and other than any holders of common stock that is one of our subsidiaries) in a single tranche, a number of Shares of our Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock. The number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock to be redeemed is determined by a formula set forth in section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation, as in effect today. This formula takes the net proceeds which we receive from the sale of shares of our class A common stock in our IPO (including the net proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters with respect to our IPO) and reduces such net proceeds by (i) the amount which we elect to reserve out of such proceeds for general corporate purposes, (ii) the amount which the litigation committee established pursuant to our retrospective responsibility plan that we will place in escrow to meet our potential obligations in respect of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and (iii) a fixed amount of $1,146,000,000.00 which we intend to use in connection with the future redemption of our class C (series II) common stock in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation. The formula allocates the resulting amount among the holders of class B common stock and class C common stock in a manner that reduces the redemption proceeds allocated to the holders of the class B common stock by the escrow amount.
Amendments to Section 4.18 and to certain related provisions.
The amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and to various related provisions of our certificate of incorporation, if approved by our stockholders, would have the effect of permitting us to effect the mandatory redemption required by section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation in two separate tranches as opposed to the single tranche currently required. This would eliminate the uncertainty regarding the timing of the redemption by allowing us to deliver a substantial portion of the mandatory redemption proceeds to our stockholders promptly after we first sell shares of our class A common stock in connection with our IPO. As a result of the amendments, we would no longer be required to wait to effect the redemption until we had received the net proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement in respect of our IPO or until such underwriters' overallotment option had expired.
It is important to note that the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation would change the overall amount of net proceeds that will be used to redeem shares of class B common stock or class C common stock, the number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock to be redeemed or the allocation of those net proceeds or shares to be redeemed among our stockholders. Further, the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation would change or otherwise affect the timing of the redemption of any shares of class C common stock (of any series) held by Visa Europe Limited or Visa Europe Services Inc., which redemption is scheduled to occur no earlier than approximately 369 days after the consummation of our reorganization.
NOT
NOT
The other proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation are required to give effect to the proposed ability to effect the mandatory redemption required by section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation in two tranches. We have modified several definitions in section 11.2 of our certificate of incorporation to give effect to the changes to section 4.18 (including definitions of "Aggregate Redemption Amount"; "Class B Percentage"; and "Class C Percentage"). Additionally, the following defined terms have been added to the certificate of incorporation: "Class B Redemption Shares"; "Class C Redemption Shares"; "Final Aggregate Redemption Amount"; "Final IPO Date"; "Initial Aggregate Redemption Amount"; "IPO Date"; and "Redemption Shares". In particular, note that we have modified the definition of "Applicable Conversion Rate" to reflect the fact that the adjustment to the conversion rate contemplated thereby would be made in two separate steps, giving effect to the two tranche redemption. The modifications to this definition allow the applicable conversion rate to be calculated at any time based on the number of shares actually redeemed at that time. In addition, we have made ministerial changes to certain other sections of our certificate of incorporation which are intended to preserve the original intent of the provisions.
The full text of all of the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation, marked to show changes from the certificate of incorporation currently in effect is attached as to this proxy statement.
Appendix A
 
Pursuant to the proposed amendments, within four (4) business days after the IPO date, we will be required to determine the initial aggregate redemption amount (the first tranche of the redemption) and within five (5) business days after the final IPO date, we will be required to determine the final aggregate redemption amount (the second tranche of the mandatory redemption). By "IPO" date we mean the date on which sales of Class A Common Stock in the IPO are first consummated. The "final IPO date" will be the earlier of (i) the date on which the underwriters' overallotment option contained in the underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters of the IPO expires and (ii) the date on which such underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full.
Pursuant to the proposed amendments, within five (5) business days of the IPO date, we will be required deliver to each holder of class B common stock and to each holder of class C common stock (in each case, other than the class C (series II) common stock and other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries), a first tranche redemption notice setting forth (i) the initial aggregate redemption amount, (ii) the escrow amount, (iii) the number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock), as applicable to be redeemed by us from such holder pursuant to such first tranche redemption notice, (iv) the date on which such redemption is to occur, which will be a date not later than ten (10) business days after the date on which the first tranche redemption notice is delivered and (v) if applicable, the place where the certificates representing such shares will be required to be surrendered for payment of the applicable redemption price.
By the "initial aggregate redemption amount" we mean an amount equal to (i) the net proceeds we receive from, or as a result of, the sale of shares of class A common stock in, the IPO on the IPO date (to be determined net of expenses and discounts and commissions paid or incurred through and including the IPO date), (ii) at our option, an amount we reasonably determine does not exceed the net proceeds we receive from, or as a result of, the sale of shares of class A common stock in the IPO after the IPO date and prior to or on the business day that immediately precedes the date on which the first tranche redemption notice is first sent, pursuant to, or as a result of the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option contained in the underwriting agreement with the several underwriters with respect to the IPO, (iii) an amount reasonably determined by the our board (or a committee thereof delegated such authority) to be an appropriate amount of funds for us to retain for general corporate purposes and (iv) the escrow amount and (v) an amount equal to U.S.$1,146,000,000.00.

On the first tranche redemption date, we will be required to redeem, out of the capital and not out of surplus ratably from the holders of class B common stock (other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries) an aggregate number of shares of class B common stock, known as the class B first tranche redemption shares, equal to ((X) the sum of ((I) the initial aggregate redemption amount and (II) the escrow amount), multiplied by the percentage (which we call the "class B percentage") of the aggregate shares of outstanding class B Common Stock (other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries) and class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) represented by shares of class B common stock immediately after the IPO date, minus (Y) the escrow amount) and divided by (Z) the price of the one share of class A common stock (net of discounts and commissions) in the IPO (which we refer to as the "IPO price"); and we will be required to redeem, out of the capital and not out of surplus ratably from the holders of class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) an aggregate number of shares of class C common stock, known as the class C first tranche redemption shares, equal to (X) the sum of ((I) the initial aggregate redemption amount and (II) the escrow amount) multiplied by (Y) the percentage (which we call the "class C percentage") of the aggregate shares of outstanding class B Common Stock (other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries) and class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) represented by shares of class C common stock, divided by (Z) the IPO price; provided, that the ratable portion of the class C (series III) common stock and the class C (series IV) common stock so redeemed shall be determined by treating the class C (series III) common stock and class C (series IV) common stock as a single series for such purpose and redeeming from the holders of such series of class C common stock, first, a number of shares of class C (series III) common stock equal to the lesser of (x) an amount equal to the number of class C
 
first tranche redemption shares attributable to such series and (y) all outstanding shares of class C (series III) common stock, ratably from such holders and, second, to the extent necessary, an amount of shares of class C (series IV) common stock which, when aggregated with the shares of class C (series III) common stock previously redeemed, equals the class C first tranche redemption shares attributable to such series, ratably from such holders.
If there are additional aggregate redemption proceeds available after the first tranche of the redemption is made, the amendments further provide that promptly, and in any event within ten (10) business days after the final IPO date, we will deliver to each holder of class B common stock and to each holder of class C common stock (in each case, other than the class C (series II) common stock and other than any common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries), at their respective addresses shown in the stock register, a final tranche redemption notice, setting forth: the (i) final aggregate redemption amount, (ii) the number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock), as applicable, to be redeemed by us from such holder pursuant to such final tranche redemption notice, (iii) the date on which such redemption is to occur, which shall be a date not later than fifteen (15) business days after the date on which the final tranche redemption notice is delivered, and (iv) if applicable, the place where certificates representing such shares of class B common stock or class C common stock, as applicable, are to be surrendered for payment of the applicable redemption price.
By the "final aggregate redemption amount" we mean an amount equal to (i) aggregate redemption amount, (ii) the amount we actually use to redeem shares of our capital stock in the first tranche of the redemption; and by the "aggregate redemption amount" we mean an amount equal to (i) the net proceeds we receive from the IPO (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any net proceeds received from the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in the underwriting agreement entered into with the several underwriters in respect of the IPO), (ii) an amount reasonably determined by our board (or a committee thereof delegated such authority) to be an appropriate amount of funds for us to retained for general corporate purposes and (iii) the escrow amount and (iv) an amount equal to U.S.$1,146,000,000.00.

The proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation would change the aggregate redemption amount (i.e., the overall amount of net proceeds that will be used to redeem shares of class B common stock or class C common stock), the number of shares of class B common stock or class C common stock to be redeemed or the allocation of those net proceeds or shares to be redeemed among our stockholders.

The amendments will require us to redeem, out of the capital and not out of surplus: from the holders of class B common stock (other than any other common stock owned by any of our subsidiaries), and each such holder shall be required to surrender to us ratably, an aggregate number of shares of class B common stock, known as the class B final tranche redemption shares equal to (X) the final aggregate redemption amount, multiplied by the (Y) class B percentage, and divided by (Z) the IPO price; and from the holders of class C common stock (other than the class C (series II) common stock) and each such holder shall be required to surrender to us ratably, an aggregate number of shares of class C common stock, known as the class C final tranche redemption shares, equal to (X) the final aggregate redemption amount, multiplied by (Y) the class C percentage divided by (Z) the IPO price; provided that the ratable portion of the class C (series III) common stock and the class C (series IV) common stock so redeemed shall be determined by treating the class C (series III) common stock and class C (series IV) common stock as a single series for such purpose and redeeming from the holders of such series of class C common stock, first, a number of shares of class C (series III) common stock equal to the lesser of (x) an amount equal to the number of class C final tranche redemption shares attributable to such series and (y) all outstanding shares of class C (series III) common stock, ratably from such holders and second, to the extent necessary, an amount of shares of class C (series IV) common stock which, when aggregated with the class C (series III) common stock previously redeemed, equals the class C final tranche redemption shares attributable to such series, ratably from such holders.
 
The full text of all of the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation, marked to show all changes from the Certificate of Incorporation currently in effect, is attached as to this proxy statement.
Appendix A
The amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and to various related provisions of our certificate of incorporation, if approved by our stockholders, would have the effect of permitting us to effect the mandatory redemption required by section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation in two separate tranches as opposed to the single tranche currently required. This would eliminate the uncertainty regarding the timing of the redemption by allowing us to deliver a substantial portion of the mandatory redemption proceeds to our stockholders promptly after we first sell shares of our class A common stock in connection with our IPO. As a result of the amendments, we would no longer be required to wait to effect the redemption until we had received the net proceeds of any underwriters' overallotment option contained in any underwriting agreement in respect of our IPO or until such underwriters' overallotment option had expired. We believe that our stockholders would prefer that, to the extent possible, we eliminate the uncertainty with respect to the timing of the redemption required by section 4.19 of our certificate of incorporation.
Reasons for the Amendments to Section 4.18 and Other Related Provisions.
We believe that the proposed amendments are responsive to the needs and desires of our stockholders, each of whom is also a customer and, as such, we believe that effecting the proposed amendments will result in more satisfied customers.
The proposed amendments also benefit the corporation in that they reduce the time period during which we will have to retain the net cash proceeds of the IPO and manage the investment of cash. This will reduce administrative burden and require us to suffer the risk associated with such cash management activities for a shorter period of time.
We also believe that the distribution as promptly as practical of that portion of the net proceeds of our IPO intended to fund the mandatory redemption required by our certificate of incorporation is consistent with the spirit and intent of our reorganization.
The proposed amendments increase the certainty of that all or a portion of the redemption required by our certificate of incorporation will occur promptly after the date on which we first receive net proceeds of the our IPO, thus allowing our stockholders to better plan their financial affairs and assess the impact on them of our IPO, if and when it occurs.
The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the amendments to section 4.18 of our certificate of incorporation and the other related provisions.
