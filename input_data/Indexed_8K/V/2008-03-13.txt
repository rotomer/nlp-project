On March 7, 2008, at a Special Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders of Visa Inc. (the "Company") approved a proposal to amend Section 4.18 of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") and certain related provisions. As a result, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 7, 2008. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation became effective upon filing.
The amendment to Section 4.18 of the Certificate and to certain related provisions has the effect of permitting the Company to effect the mandatory redemption of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock (other than Class C (Series II) Common Stock) in two separate tranches as opposed to the single tranche redemption required by the Certificate prior to this amendment.
A copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on March 7, 2008 is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to Amendment No. 6 to Visa Inc.'s Registration Statement on Form S-1 also filed today and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
