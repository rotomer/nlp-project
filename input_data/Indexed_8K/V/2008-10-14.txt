On October 14, 2008, at a meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders of Visa Inc. (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors, approved and adopted a proposal to amend and restate the Company's Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") to eliminate unnecessary provisions and synchronize the directors' terms with the Company's annual meeting schedule. As a result, the Company filed a Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 14, 2008. The Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation became effective upon filing.
The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Certificate does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The net cash amount that the Company paid to Visa Europe Limited in connection with the redemption of all its outstanding shares of Class C (Series II) Common Stock and 35,263,585 shares of its Class C (Series III) Common Stock was USD$2,645,737,091.86. As required by the Certificate, the Company used the net proceeds from its March 25, 2008 initial public offering to fund the redemption.
Conversion of Class C (Series III) and Class C (Series IV) into Class C (Series I)
In addition, immediately after the completion of the partial redemption of the Class C (Series III) Common Stock in accordance with the Certificate, each outstanding share of Class C (Series III) Common Stock and Class C (Series IV) Common Stock automatically and without further action converted into one share of Class C (Series I) Common Stock.

Section 4.12 . No fractional shares of any class of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of any shares of any other class of Common Stock into shares of such class or upon redemption of any shares of Common Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fractional amount the fair market value (as determined by or in accordance with procedures established by the Board in good faith and in its sole discretion) per share of the applicable class of Common Stock into which such shares are being converted, as of the conversion date or the applicable class of Common Stock from which such shares are being redeemed on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be. If more than one share of any class of Common Stock is being converted at one time by, or redeemed at one time from, the same holder, then the number of full shares issuable upon conversion will be calculated on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock converted or redeemed, as applicable, by such holder at such time. For purposes of determining the fair market value of any share of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock (other than Class C (Series II) Common Stock) in any redemption governed by this Section 4.12 (and solely for such purpose), each share of Class B Common Stock and each share of each series of Class C Common Stock (other than the Class C (Series II) Common Stock) shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock based on the Applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the applicable redemption.

The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made or such subdivision, combination or reclassification is not effected, the Applicable Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Applicable Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such record date or effective date had not been so fixed.
