If more than one share of any class of Common Stock is being converted at one time by, or redeemed at one time from, the same holder, then the number of full shares issuable upon conversion will be calculated on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock converted or redeemed, as applicable, by such holder
No Fractional Shares

For purposes of determining the fair market value of any share of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock in any redemption governed by this Section 4.12 (and solely for such purpose), each share of Class B Common Stock and each share of Class C Common Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock based on the Applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the applicable redemption.

The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made or such subdivision, combination or reclassification is not effected, the Applicable Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Applicable Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such record date or effective date had not been so fixed.
(b) Whenever the Applicable Conversion Rate is adjusted as described in clause (a) of this Section 4.14, or in connection with the sale of any Loss Shares or the deposit of Loss Funds into the Escrow Account, the Corporation shall (i) promptly make a public announcement to notify holders of record of the Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock (as the case may be) of such adjustment or of the then Applicable Conversion Rate after giving effect to the sale of such Loss Shares or the deposit of such Loss Funds, and (ii) take reasonable efforts to provide notice by mail to such holders at the addresses appearing on the Corporation's stock register of such adjustment or of the then Applicable Conversion Rate after giving effect to the sale of such Loss Shares or the deposit of such Loss Funds. The Corporation shall keep with its records such notice and a certificate from the Corporation's Chief Financial Officer briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation by which the adjustment has been made. The Corporation shall either include such calculation in the notification provided pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, or if it does not so include it, the Corporation shall promptly furnish it without charge upon written request of a holder of record of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct, absent manifest error.
 
(c) After an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Rate for outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.14, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment pursuant this Section 4.14 shall cause an adjustment to the Applicable Conversion Rate for outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock as so adjusted.
