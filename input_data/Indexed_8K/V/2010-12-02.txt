On December 1, 2010, Visa Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Joseph W. Saunders, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board (the "Agreement"). The Agreement supersedes the existing employment agreement dated February 7, 2008 between the Company and Mr. Saunders.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Saunders will (i) receive an annual base salary of not less than $950,000, (ii) be eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment with a target of no less than 250% of his base salary and a maximum of no less than 500% of his base salary, (iii) be eligible to receive an annual long-term incentive award with a target value of no less than 500% of his base salary, (iv) be entitled to employee benefits and fringe benefits on a basis that is no less favorable than those provided to other executive officers of the Company and perquisites on a basis that is no less favorable than those provided to Mr. Saunders immediately prior to December 1, 2010 and (v) be eligible to receive compensation in connection with Succession Services. In the event Mr. Saunders' employment terminates prior to the expiration of the term of the Agreement, Mr. Saunders may be entitled to severance payments depending on the circumstances. The Agreement also has a fixed term ending on March 31, 2013 that does not automatically renew and eliminates the gross-up for excise taxes that may be payable with respect to severance payments and other payments deemed to be made in connection with a Change of Control.
The foregoing description is not a complete description of the Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference in this Item 5.02. Any capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Agreement.
In addition and as previously announced on November 9, 2010, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") in order to better reflect current compensation practices and trends by transitioning away from individual agreements with certain of the Company's executive officers, including Messrs. John M. Partridge, Byron H. Pollitt, Joshua R. Floum and William M. Sheedy (collectively, the "Executive Officers"). Each of the Executive Officers has executed and returned a participation letter agreement, pursuant to which they have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Severance Plan and the letter agreement. The Severance Plan eliminates the gross-up for excise taxes that may be payable with respect to severance payments and other payments deemed to be made in connection with a change of control (as defined in the Severance Plan).

Limitation on Payments Under Certain Circumstances
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event the Accounting Firm (as defined below) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below) would subject the Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the "") so that the Parachute Value (as defined below) of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below). The Agreement Payments shall be so reduced only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced. If the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if the Agreement Payments were so reduced, the Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which the Executive is entitled hereunder.
Agreement Payments
(b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, the Company shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 8 shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date of Termination. For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and
 
no other Payments) shall be reduced. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the cash payments (to the extent such amounts are considered Payments) under the following sections in the following order: (1) any Payments under Section 6(a)(i)(C), (2) any Payments under Section 6(a)(i)(B) and (3) any other cash Agreement Payments that would be made upon a termination of the Executive's employment, beginning with payments that would be made last in time. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
(c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that should not have been so paid or distributed ("") or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (""), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Safe Harbor Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or the Executive that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, the Executive shall promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Overpayment is determined) pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal short-term rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code compounded semiannually; , , that no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal short-term rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) (A) of the Code compounded semiannually.

Definitions

Net After-Tax Receipt
(iii) "" of a Payment shall mean the present value as of the date of the change of control for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code will apply to such Payment.
Parachute Value

Restrictive Covenants
(a) . All records, files, memoranda, reports, customer information, client lists, documents and equipment relating to the business of the Company, which the Executive prepares, possesses or comes into contact with while the Executive is an employee of the Company, shall remain the sole property of the Company. The Executive agrees that upon the termination of his employment, he shall provide to the Company all documents, papers, files or other material in his possession and under his control that are connected with or derived from his services to the Company. The Executive agrees that the Company owns all work product, patents, copyrights and other material produced by the Executive during the Executive's employment with the Company.
Return of Company Property
(b) . The Executive shall not at any time, whether during the Executive's employment or following the termination of the Executive's employment, for any reason whatsoever, directly or indirectly, disclose or furnish to any entity, firm, corporation or person, except as otherwise required by law, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company with respect to any aspect of its operations, business or clients. "Confidential or proprietary information" shall mean information generally unknown to the
Confidential Information
 
public to which the Executive gains access by reason of the Executive's employment by the Company and includes, but is not limited to, information relating to all present or potential customers, business and marketing plans, sales, trading and financial data and strategies and operational costs.
(c) . During the Employment Period (except in the performance of his duties to the Company hereunder) and for one year following the termination of the Executive's employment for any reason or no reason, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit or induce, or cause others to solicit or induce, any employees of the Company to leave the Company or in any way modify their relationship with the Company; (ii) encourage or assist in the hiring process of any employees of the Company or in the modification of any such employee's relationship with the Company, or cause others to participate, encourage or assist in the hiring process of any employees of the Company; or (iii) solicit the trade or patronage of any clients or customers or any prospective clients or customers of the Company.
Nonsolicitation
(d) . The Executive acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purposes of the foregoing covenants are to protect the goodwill and confidential or proprietary information of the Company, and to prevent the Executive from interfering with the business of the Company as a result of or following termination of the Executive's employment with the Company; (ii) because of the nature of the business in which the Company and its affiliates are engaged and because of the nature of the confidential and proprietary information to which the Executive has access, it would be impractical and excessively difficult to determine the actual damages of the Company in the event the Executive breached any of the covenants of this Section 9; (iii) remedies at law (such as monetary damages) for any breach of the Executive's obligations under this Section 9 would be inadequate; and (iv) the terms of the covenants are sufficiently limited to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and impose no undue hardship on the Executive. The Executive therefore agrees and consents that if the Executive commits any breach of a covenant under this Section 9 or threatens to commit any such breach, the Company shall have the right (in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy that may be available to it) to temporary and permanent injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of California, or in any state in which the Executive resides, without posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual damage. With respect to any provision of this Section 9 finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the Executive and the Company hereby agree that such court shall have jurisdiction to reform this Agreement or any provision hereof so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the parties agree to abide by such court's determination. If any of the covenants of this Section 9 is determined to be wholly or partially unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such determination shall not be a bar to or in any way diminish the rights of the Company to enforce any such covenant in any other jurisdiction. In no event may a breach or threatened breach of the covenants in this Section 9 constitute a basis for the Company to suspend the Executive's right to receive any payments or benefits to which he is otherwise entitled under this Agreement.
Enforcement
10. . (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive. This Agreement and any rights and benefits hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives, heirs or legatees. This Agreement and any rights and
Successors
 
benefits hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
(b) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to satisfy all of the obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to satisfy such obligations if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

Miscellaneous
(a) . This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives. Within the time period permitted under Section 409A or any IRS or Department of Treasury regulations, rules or other guidance issued thereunder, the Company may, in consultation with the Executive, modify this Agreement in the least restrictive manner necessary and without any diminution in the value of the payments to the Executive, in order to cause the provisions of this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, so as to avoid the imposition of taxes and penalties on the Executive pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.
Amendment

Severability
(e) . No waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by any other party, or of compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party, shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by such other party of any similar or dissimilar provisions and conditions at the same or any prior or subsequent time. The failure of any party hereto to take any action by reason of such breach shall not deprive such party of the right to take action at any time while such breach continues.
Waiver of Breach
