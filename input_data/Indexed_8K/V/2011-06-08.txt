Explanatory Note
This current report on Form 8-K/A (the "Amendment") updates information provided on a current report on Form 8-K dated January 31, 2011 (the "Original Form 8-K"), relating to disclosure made under Item 5.07, Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders, associated with the Visa Inc. (the "Company") Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 27, 2011 (the "Annual Meeting"). The sole purpose of this Amendment is to disclose the Company's decision regarding how frequently it will conduct an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers.
 
As previously reported in the Original Form 8-K, in an advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers held at the Annual Meeting, 282,041,499 shares voted for one year, 1,521,921 shares voted for two years, 35,941,368 shares voted for three years, 287,194 abstained and there were 56,181,856 broker non-votes. The Company has considered the outcome of this advisory vote and has determined, as was recommended with respect to this proposal by the Company's board of directors in the proxy statement for the Annual Meeting, that the Company will hold an annual advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
