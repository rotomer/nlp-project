Approval of the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, as Amended and Restated
At the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Visa Inc. (the "Company") held on January 31, 2012, the Company's stockholders approved the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the "EIP"). The EIP was originally adopted in 2007 and amendments to the EIP were approved by the Company's Compensation Committee in October 2011 and board of directors (the "Board") in November 2011, subject to stockholder approval.
The EIP authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and performance-based awards to the Company's employees, consultants and non-employee directors whose contributions are considered essential to the continued growth and success of the Company and its affiliates. Up to 59 million shares of the Company's common stock may be delivered under the EIP, subject to adjustment by the Compensation Committee as outlined in the EIP. No awards may be granted under the EIP on or after 10 years from January 31, 2012. Time-based vesting awards under the EIP generally vest over a period of time determined in accordance with the terms of the EIP, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions, which are set forth in the EIP. The number of shares or amount of cash to be earned under performance-based awards depends upon the Company's achievement of specified performance goals. In the event of a "change of control" (as defined in the EIP) of the Company, the Compensation Committee may provide for the accelerated vesting of outstanding awards, may provide that awards will be assumed or replaced, may provide for the cash-out of awards and/or deem target payment opportunities under any performance-based awards as earned, among other things. The Compensation Committee has the exclusive authority to administer the terms of the EIP. In connection with the stockholder approval of the EIP, awards granted under the EIP may be structured to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
For more information about the EIP, please see our definitive proxy statement dated December 14, 2011. The description above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the EIP, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

(h)      construe and interpret the Plan and any agreement or instrument entered into under the Plan, including any Award Agreement;
(i)      establish and administer any terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, forfeiture, vesting or exercise schedule, and other provisions of or relating to any Award;
(j)      establish and administer any performance goals in connection with any Awards, including performance criteria and applicable Performance Periods, determine the extent to which any performance goals and/or other terms and conditions of an Award are attained or are not attained;
(k)      construe any ambiguous provisions, correct any defects, supply any omissions and reconcile any inconsistencies in the Plan and/or any Award Agreement or any other instrument relating to any Awards;
(l)      establish, adopt, amend, waive and/or rescind rules, regulations, procedures, guidelines, forms and/or instruments for the Plan's operation or administration;
(m)    make all valuation determinations relating to Awards and the payment or settlement thereof;
(n)    grant waivers of terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations under the Plan or applicable to any Award, or accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Award;
(o)      subject to the provisions of Article XV, amend or adjust the terms and conditions of any outstanding Award and/or adjust the number and/or class of shares of stock subject to any outstanding Award;
(p)      at any time and from time to time after the granting of an Award, specify such additional terms, conditions and restrictions with respect to such Award as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with any and all applicable laws or rules, including terms, restrictions and conditions for compliance with applicable securities laws or listing rules, methods of withholding or providing for the payment of required taxes and restrictions regarding a Participant's ability to exercise Options through a cashless (broker-assisted) exercise;

(s)      exercise all such other authorities, take all such other actions and make all such other determinations as it deems necessary or advisable for the proper operation and/or administration of the Plan.
3.4          .  The Committee shall, subject to applicable laws and rules, determine the date an Award is granted. Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement; however, two or more Awards granted to a single Participant may be combined in a single Award Agreement. An Award Agreement shall not be a precondition to the granting of an Award; provided, however, that (a) the Committee may, but need not, require as a condition to any Award Agreement's effectiveness, that such Award Agreement be executed on behalf of the Company and/or by the Participant to whom the Award evidenced thereby shall have been granted (including by electronic signature or other electronic indication of acceptance), and such executed Award Agreement be delivered to the Company, and (b) no person shall have any rights under any Award unless and until the Participant to whom such Award shall have been granted has complied with the applicable terms and conditions of the Award. The Committee shall prescribe the form of all Award
Award Agreements
 
Agreements, and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, shall determine the content of all Award Agreements. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy concerning the terms of an Award, the records of the Committee or its designee shall be determinative.
3.5          .  The Committee shall have full discretionary authority in all matters related to the discharge of its responsibilities and the exercise of its authority under the Plan. All determinations, decisions, actions and interpretations by the Committee with respect to the Plan and any Award Agreement, and all related orders and resolutions of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Participants, the Company and its stockholders, any Subsidiary or Affiliate and all persons having or claiming to have any right or interest in or under the Plan and/or any Award Agreement. The Committee shall consider such factors as it deems relevant to making or taking such decisions, determinations, actions and interpretations, including the recommendations or advice of any Director or officer or employee of the Company, any director, officer or employee of a Subsidiary or Affiliate and such attorneys, consultants and accountants as the Committee may select. A Participant or other holder of an Award may contest a decision or action by the Committee with respect to such person or Award only on the grounds that such decision or action was arbitrary or capricious or was unlawful, and any review of such decision or action shall be limited to determining whether the Committee's decision or action was arbitrary or capricious or was unlawful.
Discretionary Authority; Decisions Binding
3.6          .  Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, including any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including Rule 16b-3), or the applicable rules of a stock exchange, the Committee may, in its discretion, allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers under this Article III to any one or more of its members and/or delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers under this Article III to any person or persons selected by it; provided, however, that the Committee may not (a) delegate to any executive officer of the Company or an Affiliate, or a committee that includes any such executive officer, the Committee's authority to grant Awards, or the Committee's authority otherwise concerning Awards, awarded to executive officers of the Company or an Affiliate; (b) delegate the Committee's authority to grant Awards to consultants unless any such Award is subject to approval by the Committee; (c) delegate its authority to correct defects, omissions or inconsistencies in the Plan; or (d) delegate its authority with respect to Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code if such delegation would cause the Awards to fail to so qualify. Any such authority delegated or allocated by the Committee under this Section 3.6 shall be exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and any rules, regulations or administrative guidelines that may from time to time be established by the Committee, and any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
Delegation of Administration
4.1          .  The shares of stock subject to Awards granted under the Plan shall be Shares. Such Shares subject to the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or previously issued shares acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the total number of Shares that may be delivered pursuant to Awards under the Plan shall be 59,000,000. Subject to, in the case of ISOs, any limitations applicable thereto under the Code, if (a) any Shares are subject to an Option, SAR, or other Award which for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been fully exercised or satisfied, or are subject to any Restricted Stock Award (including any Shares subject to a Participant's Restricted Stock Award that are repurchased by the Company at the Participant's cost), Restricted Stock Unit Award or other Award granted under the Plan which are forfeited, or (b) any Award based on Shares is settled for cash, expires or otherwise terminates without the issuance of such Shares, the Shares subject to such Award shall, to the extent of any such expiration, termination, cancellation, forfeiture or cash settlement, be available for delivery in connection with future Awards under the Plan. Any Shares delivered under the Plan upon exercise or satisfaction of Substitute Awards shall not reduce the Shares
Number of Shares Available for Grants
 
available for delivery under the Plan; provided, however, that the total number of Shares that may be delivered pursuant to Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be the number of Shares set forth in the third sentence of this Section 4.1, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.1, but without application of the foregoing provisions of this sentence.
4.2          .  In the event of any corporate event or transaction (including a change in the Shares or the capitalization of the Company), such as a reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Section 368 of the Code), issuance of warrants or rights, dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, stock or other property), stock split or reverse stock split, spin-off, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, repurchase of shares, or other like change in corporate structure, partial or complete liquidation of the Company or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to stockholders of the Company, or any similar corporate event or transaction, the Committee shall substitute or adjust, as applicable, the number, class and kind of securities which may be delivered under Section 4.1; the number, class and kind, and/or price (such as the Option Price of Options or the Grant Price of SARs) of securities subject to outstanding Awards; the numerical limits set forth in Section 5.3; and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the Plan; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. The Committee shall also make appropriate adjustments and modifications in the terms of any outstanding Awards to reflect or related to any such events, adjustments, substitutions or changes. Any adjustment, substitution or change pursuant to this Section 4.2 made with respect to an Award intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be made only to the extent consistent with such intent, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee shall not make any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 that would cause an Award that is otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A to become subject to Code Section 409A, or that would cause an Award that is subject to Code Section 409A to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A. All determinations of the Committee as to adjustments or changes, if any, under this Section 4.2 shall be conclusive and binding on the Participants.
Adjustments in Authorized Shares
4.3          .  The existence of the Plan and any Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in its capital structure or business structure, any merger or consolidation, any issuance of debt, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Shares, additional shares of capital stock or other securities or subscription rights thereto, any dissolution or liquidation, any sale or transfer of all or part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding.
No Limitation on Corporate Actions
5.1          .  Employees, Non-Employee Directors and Consultants shall be eligible to become Participants and receive Awards in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan, subject to the limitations on the granting of ISOs set forth in Section 6.8(a).
Eligibility
5.2          .  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, select Participants from all eligible Employees, Non-Employee Directors and Consultants and shall determine the nature and amount of each Award.
Actual Participation
5.3          .
Individual Limitations on Awards
(a)      Individual Limit for Options and SARs. The maximum number of Shares with respect to which Options and SARs may be granted to any Participant in any Fiscal Year shall be 2,000,000. In connection with a Participant's commencement of service for the Company, any Affiliate
 
or Subsidiary, as applicable, a Participant may be granted Options and SARs for up to an additional 2,000,000 Shares which shall not count against the limit set forth in the previous sentence. The foregoing limitation(s) shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization pursuant to Section 4.2. To the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code or the regulations thereunder, in applying the foregoing limitation(s) with respect to a Participant, if any Option or SAR is canceled, the canceled Option or SAR shall continue to count against the maximum number of Shares with respect to which Options and SARs may be granted to the Participant.
(b)      Individual Limit for Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares. For awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Shares that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), the maximum number of Awards that may be granted to any Participant in any Fiscal Year shall be 2,000,000 Shares. The foregoing limitation shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization pursuant to Section 4.2.
(c)      Performance Units and Cash-Based Awards. For awards of Performance Units and Cash-Based Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), the maximum amount that may be paid to a Participant pursuant to such Awards for an annual Performance Period shall be $30,000,000 and for any other Performance Period, such amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the Performance Period and the denominator of which is twelve (12). The foregoing limitation shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization pursuant to Section 4.2.
6.1          .  Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, Options may be granted to Participants in such number, and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee.
Grant of Options
6.2          .  Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Option Price, the maximum duration of the Option, the number of Shares to which the Option pertains, the conditions upon which the Option shall become exercisable and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine, which are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. The Award Agreement also shall specify whether the Option is intended to be an ISO or an NQSO. To the extent that any Option does not qualify as an ISO (whether because of its provisions or the time or manner of its exercise or otherwise), such Option, or the portion thereof which does not so qualify, shall constitute a separate NQSO.
Award Agreement
6.3          .  The Option Price for each Option shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement; provided that, subject to Section 6.8(c), the Option Price of an Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted; provided further, that Substitute Awards or Awards granted in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 4.2, in the form of stock options, shall have an Option Price per Share that is intended to maintain the economic value of the Award that was replaced or adjusted, as determined by the Committee.
Option Price
6.4          .  Each Option granted to a Participant shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant and set forth in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that no Option shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of its date of grant, subject to the respective last sentences of Sections 6.5 and 6.8(c).
Duration of Options
 
6.5          .  Options shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall in each instance determine and set forth in the Award Agreement, which need not be the same for each grant or for each Option or Participant. An Award Agreement may provide that the period of time over which an Option other than an ISO may be exercised shall be automatically extended if on the scheduled expiration date of such Option the Participant's exercise of such Option would violate applicable securities laws; provided, however, that during such extended exercise period the Option may only be exercised to the extent the Option was exercisable in accordance with its terms immediately prior to such scheduled expiration date; provided further, however, that such extended exercise period shall end not later than thirty (30) days after the exercise of such Option first would no longer violate such laws.
Exercise of Options
6.6          .  Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Company, in a form specified or accepted by the Committee, or by complying with any alternative exercise procedures that may be authorized by the Committee, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for such Shares, which shall include applicable taxes, if any, in accordance with Article XVII. The Option Price upon exercise of any Option shall be payable to the Company in full either: (a) in cash or its equivalent; (b) subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as the Committee may prescribe, by tendering (either by actual delivery or attestation) unencumbered Shares previously acquired by the Participant exercising such Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Price, (c) by a combination of (a) and (b); or (d) by any other method approved or accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion, including, if the Committee so determines, (x) a cashless (broker-assisted) exercise that complies with all applicable laws or (y) withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant pursuant to the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Price. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of a written notification of exercise and full payment in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section 6.6, the Company shall deliver to the Participant exercising an Option, in the Participant's name, evidence of book entry Shares, or, upon the Participant's request, Share certificates, in an appropriate amount based upon the number of Shares purchased under the Option, subject to Section 20.10. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, all payments under all of the methods described above shall be paid in United States dollars.
Payment
6.7          .  Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, an Option may be exercised only to the extent that it is then exercisable, and if at all times during the period beginning with the date of granting of such Option and ending on the date of exercise of such Option the Participant is an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant, and shall terminate immediately upon a Termination of the Participant. An Option shall cease to become exercisable upon a Termination of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 to the contrary, the Committee may determine in its discretion that an Option may be exercised following any such Termination, whether or not exercisable at the time of such Termination; provided, however, that in no event may an Option be exercised after the expiration date of such Option specified in the applicable Award Agreement, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 6.5.
Termination of Employment or Service
6.8          .
Limitations on Incentive Stock Options
(a)      .  No ISO shall be granted to any individual otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan who is not an Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary on the date of granting of such Option. Any ISO granted under the Plan shall contain such terms and conditions, consistent with the Plan, as the Committee may determine to be necessary to qualify such Option as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. Any ISO granted under the Plan may be modified by the Committee to disqualify such Option from treatment as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code.
General
 
(b)      .  Notwithstanding any intent to grant ISOs, an Option granted under the Plan will not be considered an ISO to the extent that it, together with any other "incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to subsection (d) of such Section) under the Plan and any other "incentive stock option" plans of the Company, any Subsidiary and any "parent corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(e) of the Code, are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year with respect to Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000 (or such other limit as may be required by the Code) as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted. The rule set forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted.
$100,000 Per Year Limitation
(c)      .  No ISO shall be granted to an individual otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan who owns (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code), at the time the Option is granted, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or a Subsidiary or any "parent corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(e) of the Code. This restriction does not apply if at the time such ISO is granted the Option Price of the ISO is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date such ISO is granted, and the ISO by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from such date of grant.
Options Granted to Certain Stockholders
7.1          .  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, SARs may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee may grant an SAR (a) in connection and simultaneously with the grant of an Option (a Tandem SAR) or (b) independent of, and unrelated to, an Option (a Freestanding SAR).
Grant of SARs
7.2          .  The Grant Price for each SAR shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, subject to the limitations of this Section 7.2. The Grant Price for each Freestanding SAR shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date such Freestanding SAR is granted, except in the case of Substitute Awards or Awards granted in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 4.2. The Grant Price of a Tandem SAR shall be equal to the Option Price of the related Option.
Grant Price
7.3          .  Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option. A Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent the related Option is exercisable and may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which the related Option is then exercisable. A Tandem SAR shall entitle a Participant to elect, in the manner set forth in the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, in lieu of exercising his or her unexercised related Option for all or a portion of the Shares for which such Option is then exercisable pursuant to its terms, to surrender such Option to the Company with respect to any or all of such Shares and to receive from the Company in exchange therefor a payment described in Section 7.7. An Option with respect to which a Participant has elected to exercise a Tandem SAR shall, to the extent of the Shares covered by such exercise, be canceled automatically and surrendered to the Company. Such Option shall thereafter remain exercisable according to its terms only with respect to the number of Shares as to which it would otherwise be exercisable, less the number of Shares with respect to which such Tandem SAR has been so exercised. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with respect to a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an ISO: (a) the Tandem SAR will expire no later than the expiration of the related ISO; (b) the value of the payment with respect to the Tandem SAR may not exceed the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the related ISO at the time the Tandem SAR is exercised and the Option Price of the related ISO; and (c) the Tandem SAR may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the ISO exceeds the Option Price of the ISO.
Exercise of Tandem SARs
 
7.4          .  Freestanding SARs may be exercised upon whatever terms and conditions the Committee, in its sole discretion, in accordance with the Plan, determines and sets forth in the Award Agreement. An Award Agreement may provide that the period of time over which a Freestanding SAR may be exercised shall be automatically extended if on the scheduled expiration date of such SAR the Participant's exercise of such SAR would violate applicable securities laws; provided, however, that during such extended exercise period the SAR may only be exercised to the extent the SAR was exercisable in accordance with its terms immediately prior to such scheduled expiration date; provided further, however, that such extended exercise period shall end not later than thirty (30) days after the exercise of such SAR first would no longer violate such laws.
Exercise of Freestanding SARs
7.5          .  Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains, the Grant Price, the term of the SAR, and such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine in accordance with the Plan.
Award Agreement
7.6          .  The term of a SAR granted under the Plan shall be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the term of any Tandem SAR shall be the same as the related Option and no SAR shall be exercisable more than ten (10) years after it is granted, subject to the last sentence of Section 6.5 in the case of a Tandem SAR.
Term of SARs
7.7          .  An election to exercise SARs shall be deemed to have been made on the date of Notice of such election to the Company. As soon as practicable following such Notice, the Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
Payment of SAR Amount
(a)      The excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the Grant Price of the SAR; by
(b)      The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.7 to the contrary, the Committee may establish and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement a maximum amount per Share that will be payable upon the exercise of a SAR. At the discretion of the Committee, such payment upon exercise of a SAR shall be in cash, in Shares of equivalent Fair Market Value, or in some combination thereof.
7.8          .  Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, a SAR may be exercised only to the extent that it is then exercisable, and if at all times during the period beginning with the date of granting of such SAR and ending on the date of exercise of such SAR the Participant is an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant, and shall terminate immediately upon a Termination of the Participant. A SAR shall cease to become exercisable upon a Termination of the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.8 to the contrary, the Committee may determine in its discretion that a SAR may be exercised following any such Termination, whether or not exercisable at the time of such Termination; provided, however, that in no event may a SAR be exercised after the expiration date of such SAR specified in the applicable Award Agreement, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 6.5 (in the case of Tandem SARs) or in the last sentence of Section 7.4 (in the case of Freestanding SARs). To the extent applicable to any Tandem SAR, the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.8 are subject to the provisions of Section 6.8, pursuant to the provisions Section 7.3.
Termination of Employment or Service
8.1          .  Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units to Participants in such amounts as the Committee shall determine.
Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
 
8.2          .  Each Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Period of Restriction, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock or the number of Restricted Stock Units granted, and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine in accordance with the Plan.
Award Agreement
8.3          .  Except as provided in this Article VIII, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, encumbered, alienated, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction established by the Committee and specified in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement.
Non-Transferability of Restricted Stock
8.4          .  The Period of Restriction shall lapse based on continuing service as a Non-Employee Director or Consultant or continuing employment with the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate, the achievement of performance goals, the satisfaction of other conditions or restrictions or upon the occurrence of other events, in each case, as determined by the Committee, at its discretion, and stated in the Award Agreement. If the grants of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units are intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), the Committee will set restrictions based upon the achievement of the performance goals set forth in Section 9.3 and will determine achievement of such goals in accordance with Section 9.3.
Period of Restriction and Other Restrictions
8.5          .  Subject to Section 20.10, after the last day of the Period of Restriction applicable to a Participant's Shares of Restricted Stock, and after all conditions and restrictions applicable to such Shares of Restricted Stock have been satisfied or lapse (including satisfaction of any applicable withholding tax obligations), pursuant to the applicable Award Agreement, such Shares of Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable by such Participant. After the last day of the Period of Restriction applicable to a Participant's Restricted Stock Units, and after all conditions and restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock Units have been satisfied or lapse (including satisfaction of any applicable withholding tax obligations), pursuant to the applicable Award Agreement, such Restricted Stock Units shall be settled by delivery of Shares, a cash payment determined by reference to the then-current Fair Market Value of Shares or a combination of Shares and such cash payment as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine, either by the terms of the Award Agreement or otherwise.
Delivery of Shares, Payment of Restricted Stock Units
8.6          .  Each Participant who receives an Award of Shares of Restricted Stock shall be issued a stock certificate or certificates evidencing the Shares covered by such Award registered in the name of such Participant, which certificate or certificates may contain an appropriate legend. The Committee may require a Participant who receives a certificate or certificates evidencing a Restricted Stock Award to immediately deposit such certificate or certificates, together with a stock power or other appropriate instrument of transfer, endorsed in blank by the Participant, with signatures guaranteed in accordance with the Exchange Act if required by the Committee, with the Secretary of the Company or an escrow holder as provided in the immediately following sentence. The Secretary of the Company or such escrow holder as the Committee may appoint shall retain physical custody of each certificate representing a Restricted Stock Award until the Period of Restriction and any other restrictions imposed by the Committee or under the Award Agreement with respect to the Shares evidenced by such certificate expire or shall have been removed. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide that a Participant's ownership of Shares of Restricted Stock prior to the lapse of the Period of Restriction or any other applicable restrictions shall, in lieu of such certificates, be evidenced by a "book entry" (i.e., a computerized or manual entry) in the records of the Company or its designated agent in the name of the Participant who has received such Award. Such records of the Company or such agent shall, absent manifest error, be binding on all Participants who receive Restricted Stock Awards evidenced in such manner. The holding of Shares of Restricted Stock by the Company or such an escrow holder, or the use of book entries to evidence the ownership of Shares of Restricted Stock, in accordance with this Section 8.6, shall not affect the rights of Participants as owners of the Shares of Restricted Stock awarded to them, nor affect the restrictions applicable to such shares under the Award Agreement or the Plan, including the Period of Restriction.
Forms of Restricted Stock Awards
 
8.7          .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in a Participant's Award Agreement, to the extent permitted or required by law, as determined by the Committee, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock shall be granted the right to exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares during the Period of Restriction. A Participant shall have no voting rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units.
Voting Rights
8.8          .  During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock shall be credited with any cash dividends paid with respect to such Shares while they are so held, unless determined otherwise by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee may apply any restrictions to such dividends that the Committee deems appropriate. Except as set forth in the Award Agreement, in the event of (a) any adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, or (b) any shares or securities are received as a dividend, or an extraordinary dividend is paid in cash, on Shares of Restricted Stock, any new or additional Shares or securities or any extraordinary dividends paid in cash received by a recipient of Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including the Period of Restriction, as it relates to the original Shares of Restricted Stock.
Dividends and Other Distributions
8.9          .  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.9, during the Period of Restriction, any Restricted Stock Units and/or Shares of Restricted Stock held by a Participant shall be forfeited and revert to the Company (or, if Shares of Restricted Sock were sold to the Participant, the Participant shall be required to resell such Shares to the Company at cost) upon the Participant's Termination or the failure to meet or satisfy any applicable performance goals or other terms, conditions and restrictions to the extent set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Each applicable Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which, if any, the Participant shall have the right to retain Restricted Stock Units and/or Shares of Restricted Stock, then subject to the Period of Restriction, following such Participant's Termination. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be included in the applicable Award Agreement, need not be uniform among all such Awards issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for, or circumstances of, such Termination.
Termination of Employment or Service
9.1          .  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Performance Units, Performance Shares, and/or Cash-Based Awards may be granted to Participants in such amounts and upon such terms, and at any time and from time to time, as shall be determined by the Committee, in accordance with the Plan. A Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award entitles the Participant who receives such Award to receive Shares or cash upon the attainment of performance goals and/or satisfaction of other terms and conditions determined by the Committee when the Award is granted and set forth in the Award Agreement. Such entitlements of a Participant with respect to his or her outstanding Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award shall be reflected by a bookkeeping entry in the records of the Company, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement.
Grant of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
9.2          .  Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the Committee at the time of grant. Each Performance Share shall have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. Each Cash-Based Award shall have a value as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or value of Performance Units and Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant.
Value of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
 
9.3          .  Subject to the terms of the Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units, Performance Shares or Cash-Based Awards shall be entitled to receive payment on the number and value of Performance Units, Performance Shares or Cash-Based Awards earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals and/or other terms and conditions have been achieved or satisfied. The Committee shall determine the extent to which any such pre-established performance goals and/or other terms and conditions of a Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award are attained or not attained following conclusion of the applicable Performance Period. The Committee may, in its discretion, waive any such performance goals and/or other terms and conditions relating to any such Award. The performance goals applicable to a payment hereunder may provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement using one or more of the following measures:
Earning of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
 
 
 
9.4          Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of a Subsidiary, division, business segment or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies. The Committee may also exclude charges related to an event or occurrence which the Committee determines should appropriately be excluded, including (a) restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Company's management, or (c) the cumulative effects of tax or accounting changes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The measures which constitute the performance goals may, at the discretion of the Committee, be based on pro forma numbers and may, as the Committee specifies, either include or exclude the effect of payment of the bonuses under the Plan or any other bonus plans of the Company. The performance goals may differ from Participant to Participant. Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder. In establishing a performance goal, the Committee may, to the extent doing so does not cause any amount payable hereunder that is intended to be performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) to cease to so qualify, provide that the attainment of the performance goal shall be measured by appropriately adjusting the evaluation of the performance goal performance to exclude (i) any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year, or (ii) the effect of any changes in accounting principles affecting the Company's or a business unit's reported results.
9.5          .  Payment of earned Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards shall be as determined by the Committee and as set forth in the Award Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards in the form of cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units, Performance Shares or Cash-Based Awards as soon as practicable after the end of the Performance Period and following the Committee's determination of actual performance against the performance goals and/or other terms and conditions established by the Committee. Such Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions imposed by the Committee, including pursuant to Section 20.10. The determination of the Committee with respect to the form of payment of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award.
Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units, Performance Shares and Cash-Based Awards
9.6          .  A Participant receiving a Performance Unit, Performance Share or Cash-Based Award shall have the rights of a stockholder only as to Shares, if any, actually received by the Participant upon satisfaction or achievement of the terms and conditions of such Award and not with respect to Shares subject to the Award but not actually issued to such Participant.
Rights as a Stockholder
9.7          .  Each Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to retain Performance Units, Performance Shares and/or Cash-Based Award following such Participant's Termination. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be included in the applicable Award Agreement, need not be uniform among all such Awards issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for Termination.
Termination of Employment or Service
 
10.1          .  The Committee may grant types of equity-based or equity-related Awards not otherwise described by the terms of the Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted Shares), in such amounts (subject to Article IV) and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Committee shall determine. Such Other Stock-Based Awards may involve the transfer of actual Shares to Participants, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of Shares and may include Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the United States.
Other Stock-Based Awards
10.2          .  Each Other Stock-Based Award shall be expressed in terms of Shares or units based on Shares, as determined by the Committee. The Committee may establish performance goals in its discretion, and any such performance goals shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. If the Committee exercises its discretion to establish performance goals, the number and/or value of Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant will depend on the extent to which such performance goals are met.
Value of Other Stock-Based Awards
10.3          .  Payment, if any, with respect to an Other Stock-Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award, as set forth in the Award Agreement, in cash or Shares as the Committee determines.
Payment of Other Stock-Based Awards
10.4          .  The Committee shall determine the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to receive Other Stock-Based Awards following the Participant's Termination. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, such provisions may be included in the applicable Award Agreement, but need not be uniform among all Other Stock-Based Awards issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for Termination.
Termination of Employment or Service
11.1          .  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no adjustment shall be made in the Shares issuable or taken into account under Awards on account of cash dividends that may be paid or other rights that may be issued to the holders of Shares prior to issuance of such Shares under such Award. The Committee may grant Dividend Equivalents based on the dividends declared on Shares that are subject to any Award, including any Award the payment or settlement of which is deferred pursuant to Section 20.6. Dividend Equivalents may be credited as of the dividend payment dates, during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date the Award becomes payable or terminates or expires. Dividend Equivalents may be subject to any limitations and/or restrictions determined by the Committee. Dividend Equivalents granted with respect to Performance Units and/or Performance Shares shall only be paid when and to the extent such Award(s) are otherwise earned in accordance with their terms. Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time, and shall be paid at such times, as may be determined by the Committee.
Dividend Equivalents
12.1          .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, Full Value Awards made to Employees, Directors or Consultants shall become vested over a period of not less than three (3) years (or, in the case of vesting based upon the attainment of performance
Full Value Award Vesting Limitations
 
goals or other performance-based objectives, over a period of not less than one (1) year measured from the commencement of the period over which performance is evaluated) following the date the Award is made; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Committee may provide that such vesting restrictions may lapse or be waived upon the Participant's death, disability, retirement, any other specified Termination or the consummation of a Change of Control and (b) Full Value Awards that result in the issuance of an aggregate of up to 5% of the Shares available pursuant to Section 4.1(a) may be granted to any one or more Participants without respect to such minimum vesting provisions.
13.1          .  No ISO or Tandem SAR granted in connection with an ISO may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or in accordance with Section 13.3. Further, all ISOs and Tandem SARs granted in connection with ISOs granted to a Participant shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant.
Transferability of Incentive Stock Options
13.2          .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5 or Section 13.3 or a Participant's Award Agreement or otherwise determined at any time by the Committee, no Award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided that the Committee may permit further transferability, on a general or a specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability, subject to Section 13.1 and any applicable Period of Restriction; provided further, however, that no Award may be transferred for value or other consideration without first obtaining approval thereof by the stockholders of the Company. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement or otherwise determined at any time by the Committee, or unless the Committee decides to permit further transferability, subject to Section 13.1 and any applicable Period of Restriction, all Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan, and all rights with respect to such Awards, shall be exercisable or available during his or her lifetime only by or to such Participant. With respect to those Awards, if any, that are permitted to be transferred to another individual, references in the Plan to exercise or payment related to such Awards by or to the Participant shall be deemed to include, as determined by the Committee, the Participant's permitted transferee. In the event any Award is exercised by or otherwise paid to the executors, administrators, heirs or distributees of the estate of a deceased Participant, or such a Participant's beneficiary, or the transferee of an Award, in any such case, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Agreement and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time by the Committee, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue Shares thereunder unless and until the Company is satisfied, as determined in the discretion of the Committee, that the person or persons exercising such Award, or to receive such payment, are the duly appointed legal representative of the deceased Participant's estate or the proper legatees or distributees thereof or the named beneficiary of such Participant, or the valid transferee of such Award, as applicable. Any purported assignment, transfer or encumbrance of an Award that does not comply with this Section 13.2 shall be void and unenforceable against the Company.
All Other Awards
13.3          .  Each Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall be permitted to exercise his or her Option or SAR or to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of the Participant's death before he or she fully exercises his or her Option or SAR or receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such beneficiary designation, a Participant's unexercised Option or SAR, or amounts due but remaining unpaid to such Participant, at the Participant's death, shall be exercised or paid as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Beneficiary Designation
 
14.1          .  No person shall have any rights or claims under the Plan except in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, a Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to shares of stock covered by an Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record with respect to such shares. The liability of the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate under the Plan is limited to the obligations expressly set forth in the Plan, and no term or provision of the Plan may be construed to impose any further or additional duties, obligations, or costs on the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof or the Board or the Committee not expressly set forth in the Plan. The grant of an Award under the Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the Plan as being applicable to such type of Award, or to all Awards, or as are expressly set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the existence of the Plan nor anything contained in the Plan or in any Award Agreement shall be deemed to:
Rights or Claims
(a)      Give any Employee or Non-Employee Director the right to be retained in the service of the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary, whether in any particular position, at any particular rate of compensation, for any particular period of time or otherwise;
(b)      Restrict in any way the right of the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary to terminate, change or modify any Employee's employment or any Non-Employee Director's service as a Director at any time with or without Cause;
(c)      Confer on any Consultant any right of continued relationship with the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary, or alter any relationship between them, including any right of the Company or an Affiliate or Subsidiary to terminate, change or modify its relationship with a Consultant;
(d)      Constitute a contract of employment or service between the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary and any Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary;
(e)      Give any Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant the right to receive any bonus, whether payable in cash or in Shares, or in any combination thereof, from the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary, nor be construed as limiting in any way the right of the Company, an Affiliate and/or a Subsidiary to determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not it shall pay any Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant bonuses, and, if so paid, the amount thereof and the manner of such payment; or
(f)      Give any Participant any rights whatsoever with respect to an Award except as specifically provided in the Plan and the Award Agreement.
14.2           .  Payments and other compensation received by a Participant under an Award are not part of such Participant's normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including calculating termination, indemnity, severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments under any laws, plans, contracts, policies, programs, arrangements or otherwise. No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from the termination of the Plan or diminution in value of any Award or Shares purchased or otherwise received under the Plan.
No Effects on Benefits
 
15.1          .  In the event of a Change of Control, unless otherwise specifically prohibited by any applicable laws, rules or regulations or otherwise provided in any applicable Award Agreement, as in effect prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, specifically with respect to a Change of Control:
Treatment of Outstanding Awards
(a)      In its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, that any Awards which are outstanding shall, as applicable and in whole or in part, become vested, non-forfeitable and/or exercisable; have the restrictions, performance goals, Period of Restriction or other conditions applicable to such Awards be canceled, terminated or deemed achieved or have any restrictions on transfer, sale assignment, pledge or other disposition (including with respect to Shares issuable under such Award) lapse and/or that any Award the payment or settlement of which was deferred under Section 20.6 or otherwise may be paid or distributed immediately prior to the Change of Control, subject to Section 17.6. Without limiting the foregoing, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control, that the target payment opportunities attainable under any outstanding Awards of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards and other Awards shall be deemed to have been fully or partially earned for any Performance Period(s), immediately prior to the effective date of the Change of Control.
(b)      In its discretion and in accordance with the terms of the Plan, provide that all or certain Awards be Assumed or Replaced. In the event that an Award is not Assumed or Replaced, or in the event of a liquidation of the Company, then such Award shall, as applicable, become fully vested, non-forfeitable and/or exercisable; have the restrictions, performance goals, Period of Restriction or other conditions applicable to such Award canceled, terminated or deemed achieved or have any restrictions on transfer, sale assignment, pledge or other disposition (including with respect to Shares issuable under such Award) lapse immediately prior to the Change of Control and the target payment opportunities under such outstanding Award of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or other Award shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire Performance Period(s) immediately prior to the Change of Control. Further, unless otherwise provided in any applicable Award Agreement, as in effect prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, if a Participant with respect to whom an Award has been Assumed or Replaced incurs a Termination, either by the Company, an Affiliate or a Subsidiary without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason (a ""), after the Change of Control, then subject to Section 15.1(b)(i) all outstanding Awards that are held by such Terminated Participant, as the case may be, shall become fully vested, non-forfeitable and/or exercisable; have the restrictions, performance goals, Period of Restriction or other conditions applicable to such Award canceled, terminated or deemed achieved or have any restrictions on transfer, sale assignment, pledge or other disposition (including with respect to Shares issuable under such Award) lapse immediately prior to the Change of Control.
Terminated Participant
          (i)    Notwithstanding Section 15.1(b), with respect to outstanding Awards of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or other Awards, the target payment opportunities under such outstanding Awards of Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or other Award shall be deemed to have been fully earned for the entire Performance Period(s) immediately prior to the Change of Control, in each case immediately preceding, or upon the occurrence of the failure to assume or replace such Awards or upon a Termination described in Section 15.1(b) and (I) there shall be paid out to each Participant holding such an Award denominated
 
in Shares, not later than five (5) days prior to the effective date of the Change of Control, in the case of such Awards that are not Assumed or Replaced, or upon the occurrence of such Termination, in the case of a Termination described in Section 15.1(b), a number of Shares (or the equivalent Fair Market Value thereof, as determined by the Committee, in cash) based upon an assumed achievement of all relevant targeted performance goals, unless actual performance exceeds the target, in which case actual performance shall be used, and upon the length of time within the Performance Period which has elapsed prior to the Change of Control or such Termination, as the case may be, and (II) Awards denominated in cash shall be paid to the applicable Participant or Participants in cash within thirty (30) days following the effective date of the Change of Control, in the case of such Awards that are not Assumed or Replaced, or within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of such Termination, in the case of a Termination described in Section 15.1(b), with the pro-ration determined as a function of the length of time within the Performance Period which has elapsed prior to the Change of Control or Termination, as the case may be, and based on an assumed achievement of all relevant targeted performance goals, unless actual performance exceeds the target, in which case actual performance shall be used.
pro rata
pro rata
(c)      In its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement applicable to any Award or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, that any outstanding Award shall be adjusted by substituting for each Share subject to such Award immediately prior to the transaction resulting in the Change of Control the consideration (whether stock or other securities of the surviving corporation or any successor corporation to the Company, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or that may be issuable by another corporation that is a party to the transaction resulting in the Change of Control) received in such transaction by holders of Shares for each Share held on the closing or effective date of such transaction, in which event the aggregate Option Price or Grant Price, as applicable, of the Award shall remain the same; provided, however, that if such consideration received in such transaction is not solely stock of a successor, surviving or other corporation, the Committee may provide for the consideration to be received upon exercise or payment of an Award, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely stock or other securities of the successor, surviving or other corporation, as applicable, equal in fair market value, as determined by the Committee, to the per-Share consideration received by holders of Shares in such transaction.
(d)      In its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, the Committee may provide, either by the terms of the Award Agreement applicable to any Award or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control, that any outstanding Award (or portion thereof) shall be converted into a right to receive cash, on or as soon as practicable following the closing date or expiration date of the transaction resulting in the Change of Control in an amount equal to the highest value of the consideration to be received in connection with such transaction for one Share, or, if higher, the highest Fair Market Value of a Share during the thirty (30) consecutive business days immediately prior to the closing date or expiration date of such transaction, less the per-Share Option Price, Grant Price or outstanding unpaid purchase price, as applicable to the Award, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Award, or the applicable portion thereof.
(e)      The Committee may, in its discretion, provide that an Award can or cannot be exercised after, or will otherwise terminate or not terminate as of, a Change of Control.
15.2           .  No Participant shall have any right to prevent the consummation of any of the acts described in Section 4.2 or 15.1 affecting the number of Shares available to, or other entitlement of, such Participant under the Plan or such Participant's Award. Any actions or determinations of the Committee under this Article XV need not be uniform as to all outstanding Awards, nor treat all Participants identically. Notwithstanding the adjustments described in Section 15.1, in no event may any Option or SAR be exercised after ten (10) years from the date it was originally granted, and any changes to
No Implied Rights; Other Limitations
 
ISOs pursuant to this Article XV shall, unless the Committee determines otherwise, only be effective to the extent such adjustments or changes do not cause a "modification" (within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code) of such ISOs or adversely affect the tax status of such ISOs.
15.3          .   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan (but subject to the provisions of Section 15.1(h), the last sentence of Section 16.1 and Section 16.2) or any Award Agreement provision, the provisions of this Article XV may not be terminated, amended, or modified on or after the date of a Change of Control to materially impair any Participant's Award theretofore granted and then outstanding under the Plan without the prior written consent of such Participant.
Termination, Amendment, and Modifications of Change of Control Provisions
16.1          .  The Board may, at any time and with or without prior notice, amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the Plan, and the Committee may, to the extent permitted by the Plan, amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, including any Award Agreement, in each case, retroactively or prospectively; provided, however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the Plan shall be made which, without first obtaining approval of the stockholders of the Company (where such approval is necessary to satisfy (i) the then-applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3, (ii) any requirements under the Code relating to ISOs, or (iii) any applicable law, regulation or rule (including the applicable regulations and rules of the SEC and any national securities exchange)), would:
Amendment, Modification, and Termination
(a)      except as is provided in Section 4.2, increase the maximum number of Shares which may be sold or awarded under the Plan;
(b)      except as is provided in Section 4.2, decrease the minimum Option Price or Grant Price requirements of Sections 6.3 and 7.2, respectively;
(c)      change the class of persons eligible to receive Awards under the Plan;
(d)      extend the duration of the Plan or the period during which Options or SARs may be exercised under Section 6.4 or 7.6, as applicable; or
(e)      otherwise require stockholder approval to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule (including the applicable regulations and rules of the SEC and any national securities exchange).
In addition, (A) no such amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan or any Award theretofore granted, including any Award Agreement, shall be made which would materially impair the previously accrued rights of a Participant under any outstanding Award without the written consent of such Participant, provided, however, that the Board may amend or alter the Plan and the Committee may amend or alter any Award, including any Agreement, either retroactively or prospectively, without the consent of the applicable Participant, (x) so as to preserve or come within any exemptions from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to the rules and releases promulgated by the SEC (including Rule 16b-3), (y) if the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion that such amendment or alteration either (I) is required or advisable for the Company, the Plan or the Award to satisfy, comply with or meet the requirements of any law, regulation, rule or accounting standard or (II) is not reasonably likely to significantly diminish the benefits provided under such Award, or that such diminishment has been or will be adequately compensated, or (z) with respect to any Award that is granted to a Participant and is intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, if the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion
 
that such amendment or alteration is necessary under Section 162(m) (including any amendment to Section 162(m)) or any regulations and ruling issued thereunder to ensure that the Awards satisfy the requirements for qualification under Code Section 162(m) and (B) except as is provided in Section 4.2, but notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, neither the Board nor the Committee may take any action: (1) to amend the terms of an outstanding Option or SAR to reduce the Option Price or Grant Price thereof, cancel an Option or SAR and replace it with a new Option or SAR with a lower Option Price or Grant Price, or that has an economic effect that is the same as any such reduction or cancellation; or (2) to cancel an outstanding Option or SAR having an Option Price or Grant Price above the then-current Fair Market Value of the Shares in exchange for cash or for the grant of another type of Award, without, in each such case, first obtaining approval of the stockholders of the Company of such action.
For the avoidance of doubt, the amendment and restatement of the Plan effective as of January 31, 2012 shall not materially impair the previously accrued rights of a Participant under any Award outstanding as of January 31, 2012 without the written consent of such Participant. To the extent the Committee determines any provision of the Plan as amended and restated effective as of January 31, 2012 materially impairs the previously accrued rights of a Participant under any Award outstanding as of January 31, 2012 without such Participant's consent, the relevant provision of the Plan as in effect immediately prior to January 31, 2012 shall apply with respect to such Participant and/or Award.
16.2          .  The Board or the Committee shall make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events (including the events described in Section 4.2) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Board or the Committee determines that such adjustments are necessary to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. Any such adjustment with respect to an Award intended to be an ISO shall be made only to the extent consistent with such intent, unless the Board or the Committee determines otherwise. The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on Participants under the Plan.
Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events
17.1          .  The Company and/or any Subsidiary or Affiliate are authorized to withhold from any Award granted or payment due under the Plan the amount of all Federal, state, local and non-United States taxes due in respect of such Award or payment and take any such other action as may be necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Committee, to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. The recipient of any payment or distribution under the Plan shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company, as determined in the Committee's discretion, for the satisfaction of any tax obligations that arise by reason of any such payment or distribution. The Company shall not be required to make any payment or distribution under or relating to the Plan or any Award until such obligations are satisfied or such arrangements are made, as determined by the Committee in its discretion.
Tax Withholding
17.2          .  Without limiting the generality of Section 16.1, the Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to satisfy or arrange to satisfy, in whole or in part, the tax obligations incident to an Award by: (a) electing to have the Company withhold Shares or other property otherwise deliverable to such Participant pursuant to his or her Award (provided, however, that the amount of any Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy required Federal, state, local and non-United States withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income) and/or (b) tendering to the Company Shares owned by such Participant (or by such Participant and his or her
Withholding or Tendering Shares
 
spouse jointly) and purchased or held for the requisite period of time as may be required to avoid the Company's or the Affiliates' or Subsidiaries' incurring an adverse accounting charge, based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the payment date as determined by the Committee. All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
17.3          .  The Committee may require a Participant to give prompt written notice to the Company concerning any disposition of Shares received upon the exercise of an ISO within: (i) two (2) years from the date of granting such ISO to such Participant or (ii) one (1) year from the transfer of such Shares to such Participant or (iii) such other period as the Committee may from time to time determine. The Committee may direct that a Participant with respect to an ISO undertake in the applicable Award Agreement to give such written notice described in the preceding sentence, at such time and containing such information as the Committee may prescribe, and/or that the certificates evidencing Shares acquired by exercise of an ISO refer to such requirement to give such notice.
Special ISO Obligations
17.4          .  If a Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to an Award as of the date of transfer of Shares rather than as of the date or dates upon which the Participant would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the Code, such Participant shall deliver a copy of such election to the Company immediately after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have any liability or responsibility relating to or arising out of the filing or not filing of any such election or any defects in its construction.

17.5          .  Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that Awards will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Company does not warrant that any Award under the Plan will qualify for favorable tax treatment under Code Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States law. The Company shall not be liable to any Participant for any tax, interest, or penalties the Participant might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise, or payment of any Award under the Plan.
No Guarantee of Favorable Tax Treatment
17.6          .
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
(a)      If any Award would be considered deferred compensation as defined under Code Section 409A and would fail to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, then such Award shall be null and void; provided, however, that the Committee may permit deferrals of compensation pursuant to the terms of a Participant's Award Agreement, a separate plan, or a subplan which (in each case) meets the requirements of Code Section 409A. Additionally, to the extent any Award is subject to Code Section 409A, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Plan shall not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of any distribution related to such Award, except as permitted by Code Section 409A.
(b)      Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, in no event shall any deferral under Section 20.6 be permitted if the Committee determines that such deferral would result in the imposition of additional tax under Code Section 409A.
(c)      The Committee shall not extend the period to exercise an Option or Stock Appreciation Right to the extent that such extension would cause the Option or Stock Appreciation Right to become subject to Code Section 409A. An Award Agreement may provide that the period of time over which an NQSO may be exercised shall be automatically extended if on the scheduled expiration date of such Option the Participant's exercise of such Option would violate applicable securities laws; provided, however, that during such extended exercise period the Option may only be exercised to the extent the Option was exercisable in accordance with its terms immediately prior to such scheduled expiration date; provided further, however, that such extended exercise period shall end not later than thirty (30) days after the exercise of such Option first would no longer violate such laws.
 
(d)      Unless the Committee provides otherwise in an Award Agreement, each Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, Performance Share, Cash-Based Award and/or Other Stock-Based Award shall be paid in full to the Participant no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month after the end of the first (1st) calendar year in which such Award is no longer subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning of Code Section 409A. If the Committee provides in an Award Agreement that a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, Performance Share, Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award is intended to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Award Agreement shall include terms that are intended to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A.
(e)      No Dividend Equivalents shall relate to Shares underlying an Option or SAR unless such Dividend Equivalent rights are explicitly set forth as a separate arrangement and do not cause any such Option or SAR to be subject to Code Section 409A.
(f)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Termination that is not a Separation from Service occurs, and payment or distribution of an Award constituting deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A would otherwise be made or commence on the date of such Termination (pursuant to the Plan, the Award Agreement or otherwise), (i) the vesting of such Award shall accelerate in accordance with the Plan and the Award Agreement, (ii) such payment or distribution shall not be made or commence prior to the earliest date on which Code Section 409A permits such payment or distribution to be made or commence without additional taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A, and (iii) in the event any such payment or distribution is deferred in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (ii), such payment or distribution that would have been made prior to the deferred payment or commencement date, but for Code Section 409A, shall be paid or distributed on such earliest payment or commencement date, together, if determined by the Committee, with interest at the rate established by the Committee.
(g)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Change of Control that is not a Qualified Change of Control occurs, and payment or distribution of an Award constituting deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code would otherwise be made or commence on the date of such Change of Control (pursuant to the Plan, the Award Agreement or otherwise), (i) the vesting of such Award shall accelerate in accordance with the Plan and the Award Agreement, (ii) such payment or distribution shall not be made or commence prior to the earliest date on which Code Section 409A permits such payment or distribution to be made or commence without additional taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A, and (iii) in the event any such payment or distribution is deferred in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (ii), such payment or distribution that would have been made prior to the deferred payment or commencement date, but for Code Section 409A, shall be paid or distributed on such earliest payment or commencement date, together, if determined by the Committee, with interest at the rate established by the Committee.
(h)      Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that Awards will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Company does not warrant that any Award under the Plan will qualify for favorable tax treatment under Code Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States law. The Company shall not be liable to any Participant for any tax, interest, or penalties the Participant might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise, or payment of any Award under the Plan.

(c)      Each member of the Committee, while serving as such, shall be considered to be acting in his or her capacity as a director of the Company.

The Committee, the Company and its officers and Directors shall be entitled to rely upon the advice, opinions or valuations of any such persons. The Committee shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of such counsel or other persons.
(e)      The Company shall not be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (i) the non-issuance of Shares as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having relevant jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Committee or the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, and (ii) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Option or other Award.
18.2          .  Subject to the requirements of Delaware law, each individual who is or shall have been a member of the Committee or of the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Article III, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of the individual's own willful misconduct or except as provided by statute. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such individual may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify or hold harmless such individual.
Indemnification

The determination of whether a Participant's conduct, activities or circumstances are described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be made by the Committee in its good faith discretion, and pending any such determination, the Committee shall have the authority to suspend the exercise, payment, delivery or settlement of all or any portion of such Participant's outstanding Awards pending an investigation of the matter.
(b)      If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement (x) due to the material non-compliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, if a Participant knowingly or grossly negligently engaged in such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent such misconduct, or if a Participant is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Participant shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve (12)-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC (whichever just occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement, and (y) the Committee may in its discretion provide that if the amount earned
 
under any Participant's Award is reduced by such restatement, such Participant shall reimburse the Company the amount of any such reduction previously paid in settlement of such Award.
20.3          .  In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
Severability
20.4          .  For purposes of the Plan, a transfer of an Employee from the Company to an Affiliate or Subsidiary (or, for purposes of any ISO granted under the Plan, only a Subsidiary), or vice versa, or from one Affiliate or Subsidiary to another (or in the case of an ISO, only from one Subsidiary to another), and a leave of absence, duly authorized in writing by the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate, shall not be deemed a Termination of the Employee for purposes of the Plan or with respect to any Award (in the case of ISOs, to the extent permitted by the Code). The Committee shall have the discretion to determine the effects upon any Award, upon an individual's status as an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Consultant for purposes of the Plan (including whether a Participant shall be deemed to have experienced a Termination or other change in status) and upon the exercisability, vesting, termination or expiration of any Award in the case of: (a) any Participant who is employed by an entity that ceases to be an Affiliate or Subsidiary (whether due to a spin-off or otherwise), (b) any transfer of a Participant between locations of employment with the Company, an Affiliate, and/or Subsidiary or between the Company, an Affiliate or Subsidiary or between Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (c) any leave of absence of a Participant, (d) any change in a Participant's status from an Employee to a Consultant or a Non-Employee Director, or vice versa; and (e) upon approval by the Committee, any Employee who experiences a Termination but becomes employed by a partnership, joint venture, corporation or other entity not meeting the requirements of an Affiliate or Subsidiary, subject, in each case, to the requirements of Code Section 422 applicable to any ISOs and Code Section 409A applicable to any Options and SARs.

Exercise and Payment of Awards
20.6          .  To the extent provided in the Award Agreement, the Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer such Participant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the lapse or waiver of the Period of Restriction or other restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or the payment or satisfaction of Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units, Performance Shares, Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards. If any such deferral election is required or permitted, (a) such deferral shall represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company and shall not confer the rights of a stockholder unless and until Shares are issued thereunder; (b) the number of Shares subject to such deferral shall, until settlement thereof, be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4.2; and (c) the Committee shall establish rules and procedures for such deferrals and payment or settlement thereof, which may be in cash, Shares or any combination thereof, and such deferrals may be governed by the terms and conditions of any deferred compensation plan of the Company or Affiliate specified by the Committee for such purpose.

(b)      If at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration and/or qualification of Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state, Federal or non-United States law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the sale or purchase of Shares hereunder, the Company shall have no obligation to allow the grant, exercise or payment of any Award, or to issue or deliver evidence of title for Shares issued under the Plan, in whole or in part, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent and/or approval shall have been effected or obtained, or otherwise provided for, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
(c)      If at any time counsel to the Company shall be of the opinion that any sale or delivery of Shares pursuant to an Award is or may be in the circumstances unlawful or result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate under the statutes, rules or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, the Company shall have no obligation to make such sale or delivery, or to make any application or to effect or to maintain any qualification or registration under the Securities Act, or otherwise with respect to Shares or Awards and the right to exercise or payment of any Option or Award shall be suspended until, in the opinion of such counsel, such sale or delivery shall be lawful or will not result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate.
(d)      Upon termination of any period of suspension under this Section 20.10(d), any Award affected by such suspension which shall not then have expired or terminated shall be reinstated as to all Shares available before such suspension and as to the Shares which would otherwise have become available during the period of such suspension, but no suspension shall extend the term of any Award.
(e)      The Committee may require each person receiving Shares in connection with any Award under the Plan to represent and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring such Shares for investment without a view to the distribution thereof, and/or provide such other representations and agreements as the Committee may prescribe. The Committee, in its absolute discretion, may impose such restrictions on the ownership and transferability of the Shares purchasable or otherwise receivable by any person under any Award as it deems appropriate.

Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, Participants are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of the State of California, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to the Plan or any related Award Agreement.
Governing Law
20.13          .  The Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the issuance of Shares or the payment of cash upon exercise or payment of any Award.

(d)      Establish subplans and adopt or modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable.
