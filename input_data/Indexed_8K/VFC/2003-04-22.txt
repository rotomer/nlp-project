GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA - APRIL 22, 2003 - VF CORPORATION (NYSE: VFC), the world's largest apparel company, today announced that first quarter earnings from continuing operations rose to a record $.83 per share, compared with $.67 per share in the first quarter of 2002. Prior year earnings per share included a net restructuring charge of $.03 per share (see page 7). Income from continuing operations increased to $92.1 million from $77.0 million in the 2002 period. Excluding restructuring charges taken in the first quarter of 2002, income from continuing operations rose 14% in 2003 from $80.5 million in the prior year period. Reflecting a required change in accounting policy for goodwill, the Company reported in the first quarter of 2002 a net loss of $448.3 million, equal to $3.96 per share. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. Sales in the quarter rose 3% to $1,250.1 million versus $1,212.3 million in the prior year's quarter. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted both sales and earnings in the quarter. Excluding foreign currency effects, sales were about flat with the prior year period. The benefit to earnings per share in the quarter was $.05. Commented Mackey J. McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer, "This was a great quarter. Our focus on managing costs is serving us well in this environment. As important, our brands and financial position remain strong, providing us with excellent leverage when conditions improve." BUSINESS REVIEW International jeans sales rose 15% reflecting the positive effects of foreign currency translation. Domestic jeans sales declined 7% due to aggressive actions taken by retail customers during the quarter to control inventories and a number of store closings by customers. Global intimate apparel sales rose 9% in the quarter, with increases across the Company's department store, mass market and international businesses. Sales in the Company's outdoor coalition, which includes The North Face, JanSport and Eastpak brands, rose 15% in the quarter, driven by double-digit sales increases of The North Face brand products in both the U.S. and internationally. Imagewear sales rose 10%, with a double-digit increase in licensed sports apparel sales.
Page 2 of 7 April 22, 2003 Playwear sales declined 15%; the Company recently disclosed that it was exploring strategic options for this business. On a currency-adjusted basis, international jeans sales rose 2%, global intimate apparel sales rose 5% and outdoor sales rose 7%. Gross margins rose almost two full percentage points in the quarter, to 37.5%, reflecting lower product costs. Operating margins improved from 11.3% to 12.2%; excluding the impact of restructuring charges, operating margins in the 2002 quarter were 11.8%. The Company's international jeanswear, intimate apparel, imagewear and outdoor businesses all reported improved margins in the quarter. Inventories rose in the quarter as anticipated, reflecting planned increases to support improvements in customer service, the aforementioned tight inventory control by retail customers and the impact of foreign currency translation. The Company continues to expect that inventories at year-end will be flat to up slightly over prior year levels, depending on sales trends. The Company's balance sheet remains exceptionally strong. Debt as a percent of total capital was 28.0%; net of cash, the ratio was 18.9%. OUTLOOK The Company continues to expect that earnings for the full year should increase 5-10% over 2002 earnings per share of $3.38 from continuing operations (which excludes restructuring charges of $.14 per share). We also continue to anticipate that operating margins will improve to 13% in 2003 and that cash flow from operations will be approximately $400 million. In terms of the second quarter, we expect sales to be flat. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2002, earnings per share in the second quarter of 2003 could be flat to down 5%, which is in line with our original plan. "Our guidance for the year - higher margins, strong cash flow and a healthy increase in earnings per share - remains intact and reflects our confidence in our ability to successfully navigate our way through an environment that offers both significant challenges as well as opportunities," Mr. McDonald concluded. DIVIDEND DECLARED The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.25 per share, payable on June 20, 2003 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 10, 2003.
