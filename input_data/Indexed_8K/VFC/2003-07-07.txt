Recitals Article 2 THE MERGER Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation and shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware Law (the "Surviving Corporation"). (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger). (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law. Section 2.02. Consummation. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the Merger shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 10.01, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9, the consummation of the Merger shall take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as possible, but in no event later than 5 Business Days, after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.01(a) and 9.01(c), or at such other time or place as Parent and the Company may agree. Section 2.03. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time: (a) each share of Common Stock held as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; (b) each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Subsidiary ("Merger Subsidiary Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of 6
common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted; and (c) each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(a) or as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to shares of Common Stock as to which appraisal rights have been exercised, be converted into the right to receive in cash from Parent an amount equal to $17.00 (the "Merger Consideration"). Section 2.04. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing shares of Common Stock (the "Certificates") for the Merger Consideration, and Parent and Exchange Agent shall enter into an exchange agreement which shall, in form and substance, be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent in a separate fund established for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid for all of the Certificates at the Effective Time. For purposes of determining the Merger Consideration to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that no holder of shares of Common Stock will perfect appraisal rights with respect to such shares. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this Article 2 and shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in: (A) direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America with a remaining term at the time of acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days, (B) money market accounts or certificates of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America or a State thereof having a combined capital surplus in excess of $500,000,000 (a "United States Bank"), (C) commercial paper issued by a domestic corporation and given a rating of no lower than A1 by Standard & Poor's Corporation and P1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. with a remaining term at the time of acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days or (D) demand deposits with any United States Bank. The earnings and interest thereon shall be paid to Parent or as Parent directs. As soon as practicable (but not more than three Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of a Certificate in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration (which shall (i) be in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company and (ii) specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. (b) Each holder of shares of Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, 7
upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Common Stock represented by a Certificate. Such payment of the Merger Consideration shall be sent to such holder of shares of Common Stock promptly after receipt of such Certificate and letter of transmittal by the Exchange Agent. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Common Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) to pay for shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand. Section 2.05. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 8
Effective Time and which are held by a holder who has not voted such shares of Common Stock in favor of the Merger, who shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares of Common Stock in the manner provided by Delaware Law and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of Delaware Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Delaware Law; provided, however, that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of Delaware Law, (ii) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for appraisal of such Shares or lost his right to appraisal and payment for his shares of Common Stock under Section 262 of Delaware Law or (iii) if neither any holder of Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation shall have filed a petition demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the time provided in Section 262 of Delaware Law, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Common Stock and each such share of Common Stock shall be treated as if it had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, from Parent as provided in Section 2.02 hereof. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Section 2.06. Stock Options. (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled, and Parent shall pay or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay each holder at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such option surrendered an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Stock Option under the Nautica Enterprises, Inc. 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated) (the "1996 Plan"), if the "Change of Control Price" (as defined under the 1996 Plan) is higher than the Merger Consideration, such Change of Control Price shall be substituted for the Merger Consideration in clause (i) above. 9
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts (without the expenditure of any funds) to obtain any consents from holders of options to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that the Company deems reasonably necessary to accomplish the transactions contemplated by Section 2.06(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.06, payment may be withheld in respect of any employee stock option until such necessary consents are obtained. (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take, or shall cause the plan administrator to take, any actions that the Company deems reasonably necessary under the State-O-Maine, Inc. 1989 Employee Incentive Stock Plan (the "1989 Plan") to effect the transactions contemplated by Section 2.06(a) with respect to Company Stock Options under the 1989 Plan using the Merger Consideration as provided in clause (i) of Section 2.05(a). Section 2.07. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. Section 2.08. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Except as set forth in Section 6.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall conduct their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and shall use reasonable efforts to preserve intact their business organizations and relationships with third parties and to keep available the services of their present officers and employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as set forth in Section 6.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as contemplated by this Agreement: (a) the Company shall not adopt or propose any change to its restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (b) the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, merge or consolidate with any other Person, acquire a material amount of assets of any other Person or acquire more than 30% of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of any other Person; provided that in no event shall the purchase price for any such acquisition of assets, capital stock or other equity interests exceed $1 million for any such individual acquisition or $5 million in the aggregate for all such acquisitions; (c) the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any Significant Subsidiary or any material amount of assets, securities or property except either (i) pursuant to existing contracts or commitments or (ii) in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; (d) the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, knowingly take any action that would make any representation and warranty of the Company contained in Section 4.01, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10(b), 4.10(d), 4.10(e), 4.10(h) or 4.19 inaccurate in any material respect at, or as of any time prior to, the Effective Time; or (e) the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree or commit to do any of the foregoing. Section 6.02. Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material. The Company shall cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval and adoption of this 27
Agreement and the Merger by the Company's stockholders. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and file with the SEC, use reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC and thereafter mail to its stockholders as promptly as practicable the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials for such meeting, (ii) subject to Section 6.03(b), use reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals by its stockholders of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Stockholder Approval") and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Section 6.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) From and after the execution of this Agreement by all of the parties hereto until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 10, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall instruct its or their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action designed to facilitate the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or knowingly afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than such components of such businesses, properties or assets that are generally accessible to the public) to, any Third Party that to the knowledge of the Company is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) (A) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) amend or grant any waiver or release or approve any transaction or redeem rights under the Rights Agreement, (C) approve any transaction under Section 203 of Delaware Law or (D) approve of any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section 203 of Delaware Law and/or (iv) enter into any agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii) or a Superior Proposal Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(ii)(B)). (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may, in response to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (provided such Acquisition Proposal is not received in violation of Section 6.03(a)), (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to such Third Party nonpublic information relating to, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books and records of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent), (iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its stockholders referred to in Section 6.02, (iv) amend or grant any waiver referred to in Section 6.03(a)(iii)(A), (v) take 28
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(a)(iii)(B)-(D), but only in connection with entry into a Superior Proposal Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(ii)(B) and/or (vi) enter into a Superior Proposal Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(ii)(B). Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take, (ii) making with respect to an Acquisition Proposal a "stop-look-and-listen" communication of the nature contemplated in, and otherwise in compliance with, Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act as a result of receiving an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, complying with Rules 14e-2(a) or 14d-9 under the 1934 Act or making such disclosure to the Company's stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of Directors, is necessary for the Company's Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law. Unless this Agreement is previously terminated in accordance with Article 10, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting, even if the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time after the date of this Agreement that it is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it. (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the first sentence of the preceding subsection unless the Company delivers to Parent no later than substantially contemporaneously with the taking of such action a written notice advising Parent that it is taking (or will take) such action. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than such components of such businesses, properties or assets that are generally accessible to the public) by any Third Party that to the knowledge of the Company is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all material respects, on a prompt basis, of the status and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the advisors, employees and other agents of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by all parties hereto with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its 29
Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote (excluding absent or abstaining directors), after taking into account, among other things, all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are more favorable and provide greater value to the Company's stockholders in their capacity as such than as provided hereunder and which the Board of Directors of the Company believes is reasonably likely to be able to be consummated. Section 6.04. Tax Matters. (a) Except as otherwise required by applicable law or with the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of tax accounting, file any amended Tax Returns or claims for Tax refunds, enter into any closing agreement with a Taxing Authority or settle or compromise any Tax claim, audit or assessment if any such action or omission, considered in the aggregate, would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or reducing any material Tax Asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. (b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) imposed upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its stockholders, in connection with the Merger (including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid by the Company when due, and the Company shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Company shall join in the execution of any such Tax returns and other documentation. Section 6.05. Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, subject to applicable law, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, the Company shall (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, employees, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate with Parent in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder. In addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall make available to Parent copies of each Internal Revenue Service determination letter received after the date of this Agreement 30
with respect to any Employee Plan referred to in the first sentence of Section 4.16(d). Section 6.06. Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of: (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) any material notice or other material communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Sections 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 or 4.16, as the case may be, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 6.07. Disclosure Schedule. On the date of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent a schedule (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), accompanied by a certificate signed by an authorized officer of the Company stating the Company Disclosure Schedule is being delivered pursuant to this Section 6.07. The Company Disclosure Schedule constitutes an integral part of this Agreement. A matter set forth in one item of the Company Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other item of the Company Disclosure Schedule so long as its relevance to the other sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Schedule or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. Article 7 COVENANTS OF PARENT Parent agrees that: Section 7.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 31
Section 7.02. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote any shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Section 7.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following: (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") from and against, and defend any Indemnified Person from and reimburse any Indemnified Person for, (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), fines, liabilities and judgments and amounts that are paid in settlement arising out of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (A) to the extent based on, or arising out of, the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to any action or omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time or (B) to the extent based on, or arising out of, or pertaining to, (1) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation the Chu Agreements) or (2) the Proxy Contest, and (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or provided under the Company's restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law. The Surviving Corporation will, and the Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of each Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Person is seeking indemnification hereunder as such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses are incurred (subject to having received an undertaking from such Indemnified Person to reimburse such expenses if it is subsequently determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law). In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall pay a per diem fee of $3,000 per day to each Specified Director, for each day spent by such Specified Director in preparing for, traveling to, cooperating or testifying in connection with, any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which such Specified Director is required to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.03(a) ("Proceedings Cooperation") (such amount to be pro rated for any day on which less than eight hours is so spent), but only after such Specified Director has engaged in Proceedings Cooperation for a total of two days (or, if longer, 16 hours) in connection with any Proceedings Cooperation after the date of this Agreement, provided that the aggregate amount of per diem 32
fees payable hereunder to all Specified Directors shall not exceed $150,000. Each of Israel Rosenzweig, Robert B. Banks, and Ronald G. Weiner shall constitute "Specified Directors". Parent shall be jointly and severally liable with the Surviving Corporation for the performance of the Surviving Corporation's obligations under this Section 7.03(a) and Section 7.03(b). Upon receipt by an Indemnified Person of actual notice of a claim, action or proceeding against such Indemnified Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 7.03(a), such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto. In addition, an Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation after any action is commenced (by way of service with a summons or other legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim) against such Indemnified Person. In any event, failure so to notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation or Parent from any liability which the Surviving Corporation or Parent may have on account of this indemnity or otherwise, except to the extent the Surviving Corporation shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. The Surviving Corporation may, at its election (such election to be made within 30 days of receipt of the summons or other legal process referred to above), and, if requested by an Indemnified Person, shall (within 30 days of receipt of a request thereto), assume the defense of and control any litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (with, in the case of any litigation or proceeding brought in federal or state court in the State of Delaware or the State of New York, counsel of international stature having a principal office in New York, and, in the case of any other litigation or proceeding, with counsel of national stature), including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and the payment of the fees and expenses of such counsel, in which event, except as provided below, the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of any other counsel retained by an Indemnified Person in connection with such litigation or proceeding. The Indemnified Person may assume the defense of and control any such litigation or proceeding in the event that the Surviving Corporation is not in good faith pursuing the defense of such matter or if within the applicable period specified in the immediately preceding sentence the Surviving Corporation shall not assume the defense of such matter. In the case of any proceeding or litigation the defense and control of which the Indemnified Person shall have assumed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence (and in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) of the next succeeding sentence), (i) the Indemnified Party may retain its own counsel, (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel promptly after receipt of any invoices with respect thereto (subject to having received an undertaking from such Indemnified Person to reimburse such expenses if it is subsequently determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification under 33
applicable law), and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. In any such litigation or proceeding the defense of which the Surviving Corporation shall have so assumed and be pursuing in good faith, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in (but not control) such litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such litigation or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would, in the good faith opinion of counsel to the Surviving Corporation, be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Person. In any litigation or proceeding of which the Surviving Corporation shall have assumed the defense, the Surviving Corporation shall not settle such matter without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and no Indemnified Person shall be required to agree to settle such matter unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of or in connection with such matter, (y) does not include any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by, or on behalf of, such Indemnified Person or payment of any money by such Indemnified Person and (z) does not result in the imposition against such Indemnified Person of injunctive or other equitable relief. The Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Surviving Corporation agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment; provided that if the Surviving Corporation shall not have assumed and pursued in good faith the defense of any litigation or proceeding, the Indemnified Person may settle any such litigation or proceeding with the consent of the Surviving Corporation, in which case the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for such settlement and promptly indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any liability by reason of such settlement. (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.03(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess of 250% of the annualized premium for such policy based on the rate thereof as of the date of this Agreement, which amount Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date of 34
this Agreement. If, during such six-year period, such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for an amount in excess of 250% of the Company's annual premium therefor, the Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as can be obtained for an amount equal to 250% of the Company's annual premium therefor in effect at the Effective Time, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the Company's then existing directors' and officers' liability insurance. (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.03. (d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in addition to any rights to indemnification and exculpation of personal liability that such Person may have under the restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives. Section 7.04. Parent Employee Matters. (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, effective on and after the Effective Time, to honor and assume and agree to perform the obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Employee Plans and all employment, severance, termination, change of control, consulting and collective bargaining agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, in each case, to the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would have been required to perform such plan or agreement. (b) Parent agrees that, for at least one year following the Effective Time, subject to applicable law, Parent will provide, or cause to be provided, to the individuals who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time except employees covered by collective bargaining agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party, with respect to whom Section 7.04(a) shall apply (the "Transferred Employees") benefits materially no less favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees or, at the election of Parent, 35

"We are thrilled to be joining forces with VF, a company that is a great fit for us as we share similar values, integrity and culture," said Harvey Sanders, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Nautica Enterprises, Inc. "I look forward to working closely with Mackey and his team as we transition our business to become part of a larger organization that will afford us the leverage to grow our various businesses and move forward. We believe this transaction shows our commitment to returning to our shareholders enhanced value on their investment." David Chu, vice chairman of Nautica Enterprises, Inc., will assume responsibility following the merger for the Nautica brand, overseeing global design, product development and marketing. "I'm excited to be joining forces with such a strong partner and I view this transaction as the best means of maximizing the full potential of the Nautica brand. This year marks Nautica's 20th anniversary, and I view this transaction as a fitting way to celebrate both the longevity of the brand as well as its bright future. I'm personally looking forward to this new endeavor," he said. Nautica will continue to maintain its headquarters in New York City and its distribution center in Martinsville, Virginia. Terms Pursuant to the merger agreement, VF will pay Nautica shareholders $17.00 per share in cash. The Company will also pay approximately $14.6 million, net of tax, to cash out employee stock options, for a total consideration of approximately $585.6 million.
Page 2 of 3 July 7, 2003 The boards of directors of both companies have approved the merger. The merger is subject to Nautica shareholder approval, receipt of customary government approvals and other customary conditions. In connection with the transaction, VF has obtained commitments from Harvey Sanders and David Chu to vote all Nautica shares owned by them in favor of the merger, representing a total of approximately 10% of the current shares outstanding. VF has separately entered into an agreement with Mr. Chu to acquire from him his rights to receive 50% of the net royalty income from licensing the Nautica trademark. Under this agreement VF will pay Mr. Chu $38 million upon the closing of the transaction and $33 million on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the closing. Mr. Chu will also have the right to receive payments in each of the next five years in the event an annual gross royalty revenue threshold is exceeded. VF Priorities Commented Mr. McDonald, "We believe Nautica has the potential for significant growth, both in the U.S. and internationally. Our priorities include the following: o Stabilize and reinvigorate the Nautica men's sportswear business under David Chu's leadership and strong brand vision. o Strengthen and grow the Nautica men's and women's jeans and Earl Jean businesses, each of which are performing well at retail. These brands will greatly enhance our jeanswear presence in department and specialty stores. o Identify opportunities to share resources between Nautica's retail operations and VF's outlet business. o Grow the business and reduce costs so that Nautica can achieve returns in line with our long-term targets of a 14% operating margin and a 17% return on capital within a 3 to 5 year period. o Explore the development of a new women's sportswear line for future launch. Research we recently conducted indicates that women have a strong positive perception of the Nautica brand. Mr. McDonald noted that the Company will be working with John Varvatos to determine the best plan for the future growth of the John Varvatos branded business. "We have searched long and hard for the right brand for our portfolio and the right opportunity to enhance shareholder value," Mr. McDonald continued. "Nautica is it. It provides us with a new platform for profitable growth and we're excited about the future potential we see for the brand. We're looking forward to working with the very talented people within Nautica to realize this potential." Other Information VF will finance the acquisition initially through available cash and short-term borrowings. The Company anticipates that with any required borrowings the resulting ratio of debt to total capital would remain below VF's long-term target of 40%. The financial adviser to VF was Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Conference Call Webcast Management will hold a conference call with investors to discuss this transaction this morning at 9:00 a.m. EDT.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: Section 1. Definitions.

(b) "Cause" shall mean (i) any act or omission which constitutes a material breach by the Executive of this Agreement; (ii) a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony (or indictable offense) or a misdemeanor (or summary conviction offense) involving moral turpitude; (iii) the Executive's grossly negligent or willful violation of corporate policy or reasonable and appropriate directions from senior management of the Parent; or (iv) a material breach of the Executive's fiduciary duties. (c) "Change in Control" shall mean:
(i) a change in control of the Parent of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A, as in effect on the date hereof, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); provided, that, without limitation, such a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if: (A) any "Person" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act), except for (1) those certain trustees under Deeds of Trust dated August 21, 1951 and under the Will of John E. Barbey, deceased (a "Trust" or the "Trusts"), and (2) any employee benefit plan of the Parent or any subsidiary company of the Parent, or any entity holding voting securities of the Parent for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan (a "Benefit Plan" or the "Benefit Plans"), is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Parent representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Parent's then outstanding securities; (B) there occurs a contested proxy solicitation of the Parent's shareholders that results in the contesting party obtaining the ability to vote securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Parent's then outstanding securities; or (C) there occurs a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of substantially all of the assets of the Parent to another entity, except to an entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Parent, or a merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Parent in which the Parent is not the surviving entity, or a plan of liquidation or dissolution of the Parent other than pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency laws is adopted; or (ii) a sale by the Parent of substantially all of the assets of Nautica. Notwithstanding Clause (c)(i)(A) above to the contrary, a change in control shall not be deemed to have occurred if a Person becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Parent representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Parent's then outstanding securities solely as the result of an acquisition by the Parent or any subsidiary company of the Parent of voting securities of the Parent which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such Person to 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Parent's then 2
outstanding securities; provided, however, that if a Person becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Parent's then outstanding securities by reason of share purchases by the Parent or any subsidiary company of the Parent and shall, after such share purchases by the Parent or a subsidiary company of the Parent, become the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of any additional voting securities of the Parent, then a change in control of the Parent shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to such Person under Clause (c)(i)(A) above.

If such a declaration shall be properly made, no benefits shall be payable hereunder as a result of such prior but now ineffective change in control, but benefits shall remain payable and this Agreement shall remain enforceable as a result of any other change in control unless it is similarly declared to be ineffective.

The Executive shall, during the Consulting Term, render such Consulting Services to the Company and the Division as may be reasonably requested by the Company; provided, that Executive shall not be required to devote more than 60 hours per month to the provision of such services. Such Consulting Services shall be related to such matters relating to the Division as the Company may designate from time to time.

Section 11. Confidential Information. The Executive acknowledges that, in the course of his employment, he has had and will have access to and has become and will become aware of and informed of confidential and/or proprietary information that is a competitive asset of the Parent, the Company, their subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Group"), including, without limitation the terms of agreements or arrangements between any members of the Group and any third parties, marketing strategies, marketing methods, development ideas and strategies, personnel training and development programs, financial results, strategic plans and demographic analyses, trade secrets, business plans, product designs, statistical data, and any non-public information concerning the Group, its employees, suppliers, resellers, or customers, other than (i) information which is otherwise available in the public domain (other than by reason of the breach by the Executive of this Agreement) and (ii) generic information of the type that would generally be known by individuals of the Executive's level of experience in the apparel industry that does not pertain in a unique way to the Group (collectively, "Confidential Information"). The Executive will keep all Confidential Information in strict confidence while employed by the Company and thereafter and will not directly or indirectly make known, divulge, reveal, furnish, make available or use any Confidential Information (except in good faith in the course of his regular authorized duties on behalf of the Company or the Division and for the benefit of the Company or the Division). The Executive's obligations of confidentiality hereunder will survive the termination of this Agreement, until and unless any such Confidential Information becomes, through no fault of the Executive, generally known to the public or the Executive is required by law to make disclosure (after giving the Company notice and an opportunity to contest such requirement). The Executive's obligations under this Section 11 are in addition to, and not in limitation or preemption of, all other obligations of confidentiality which the Executive may have to the Company under general legal or equitable principles. Section 12. Employee Conceptions and Developments. The Company shall own all Intellectual Property Rights in and to, and, for the duration of such Intellectual Property Rights have the exclusive rights of commercial exploitation with respect to, all Conceptions and Developments made individually or jointly 10
by Executive while Executive is employed by the Company (the "IP Period"). Any application made within six months after the IP Period to register or protect Intellectual Property Rights in any Conceptions and Developments as to which Executive was an inventor, author or assignor shall be presumed to have been originally made during the IP Period and subject to the Company's ownership pursuant to the foregoing sentence. For purposes hereof, the term "Conceptions and Developments" means all creative, expressive, branding or technological conceptions, discoveries and developments of any nature, including without limitation conceptions for products and processes, inventions, designs, writings, graphics, animations and other works or authorship, specifications, drawings, methods, formulas and branding proposals, and any implementations, improvements, derivative works or modifications thereof relating to the business of the Company, and the term "Intellectual Property Rights" means all U.S. and foreign patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret, publicity and similar rights. (including without limitation any and all common law rights), and all rights of priority under international conventions to make application with respect thereto. All Conceptions and Developments arising during the IP Period by virtue of either of the first two sentences of this Section 12 are referred to as the "Covered Conceptions and Developments". Executive shall be obligated to assign to the Company all inventions included in the Covered Conceptions and Developments. All works of authorship included in the Covered Conceptions and Developments shall be deemed "works made for hire" to the maximum extent they may qualify as such under 17 U.S.C. Section 101, and otherwise the copyright therein shall be deemed to have been fully assigned by Executive to the Company at the time such works were made. All Covered Conceptions and Developments, whether or not patentable, shall be promptly disclosed to the Company in writing, and shall be held in confidence by Executive and treated as "Confidential Information" subject to Section 11 of this Agreement, until such time as the Company, in its sole determination, shall elect to make the subject matter thereof publicly known. Executive agrees that, at the expense of the Company, he will, without additional compensation, take any such further action, including the rendering of all lawful testimony and assistance, and the execution and delivery to such instruments as the Company may reasonably require from time to time, to perfect, effectuate, register, record or enforce the Company's rights or interests in any of the Covered Conceptions and Developments. The Executive hereby irrevocably appoints the Company to be the Executive's attorney-in-fact to act in Executive's name, place and stead to do and execute any such act or instrument for the purpose of this Section 12. The Company shall be under no liability to account to the Executive for any revenue or profit derived or resulting from the use, exploitation or licensing of any of the Covered Conceptions or Developments subject to this Section 12 (other than pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement). Section 13. Noncompetition, Noninterference and Nonsolicitation. (a) Subject to the geographic limitation of Section 13(b) hereof, the Executive (i) 11
during the period from the Effective Date through December 31, 2005 shall not, directly or indirectly, on his behalf or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, as an employee or otherwise, engage in, or in any way be concerned with or negotiate for, or acquire or maintain any ownership interest in any business or activity which is the same as or competitive with that conducted by the Parent or the Company at the termination of his employment by the Company, or which was engaged in or developed by the Parent or the Company at any time during the Employment Term for specific implementation in the immediate future by the Parent or the Company; and (ii) during the Consulting Term shall not, directly or indirectly, on his behalf or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, as an employee or otherwise, engage in, or in any way be concerned with or negotiate for, or acquire or maintain any ownership interest in any business or activity which is the same as or directly competitive with that conducted by the Division at the termination of his employment by the Company, or which was engaged in or developed by the Division at any time during the Employment Term for specific implementation in the immediate future by the Division. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be construed to be in violation of this Section 13 solely by reason of (i) owning, directly or indirectly, any stock or other securities of a corporation (or comparable interest in any other form of business organization or entity) that has any class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if the Executive's interest does not exceed 10% of the outstanding capital stock of such corporation (or comparable interest in such other organization or entity), (ii) owning, directly or indirectly, any stock or other securities of a corporation (or comparable interest in any other form of business organization or entity) that does not have any class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if the Executive's interest does not exceed 25% of the outstanding capital stock of such corporation (or comparable interest in such other organization or entity), or (iii) serving as a non-executive director (non-employee and not involved in the management of any such company) on the board of directors of a corporation (or in a similar capacity with respect to any other organization or entity), in each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) regardless of whether or not such corporation (or other business organization or entity) has a business that is the same or competitive with any business of the Parent or the Company (including, without limitation, the Division). (b) The Executive acknowledges that each of the Parent and the Company is engaged in business throughout the United States and in various foreign countries and that the Parent and the Company each intend to expand the geographic scope of its activities. Accordingly and in view of the nature of his position and responsibilities, the Executive agrees that the provisions of this Section 13 shall be applicable to each state and each foreign country, possession 12
or territory in which the Parent and/or the Company may be engaged in business during the Employment Term and Consulting Term. (c) The Executive agrees that during the period from the Effective Date through December 31, 2005 and during the Consulting Term, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, for himself or on behalf of any third party at any time in any manner, (i) request or cause any of the Parent's or the Company's customers to cancel, terminate, reduce or otherwise adversely modify any existing or continuing business relationship with the Parent and/or the Company; (ii) solicit, entice, persuade, induce, request or otherwise cause any employee, officer or agent of the Parent and/or the Company (other than clerical employees) to refrain from rendering services to the Parent and/or the Company or to terminate his or her relationship, contractual or otherwise, with the Parent and/or the Company; other than through a general advertisement or public solicitation not directed specifically to employees of the Parent or the Company; or (iii) induce or attempt to influence any supplier to cease or refrain from doing business or to decline to do business with the Parent, the Company or any of their subsidiaries. (d) The Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Parent and the Company and agrees that if the Executive breaches any provision of this Section 13, and does not cure such breach within 30 business days after the receipt of written notice from the Company or the Parent, the Executive shall not be entitled to any further payments or benefits pursuant to this Agreement. Section 14. Equitable Remedies. (a) The Executive acknowledges that his compliance with the covenants in Sections 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement is necessary to protect the good will and other proprietary interests of the Company and that, in the event of any violation by the Executive of the provisions of Sections 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement, the Company will sustain serious, irreparable and substantial harm to its business, the extent of which will be difficult to determine and impossible to remedy by an action at law for money damages. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of such violation or threatened violation by the Executive, the Executive shall not assert in response to any claim for injunctive or other equitable relief the defense that the Company or Parent has an adequate remedy at law for any such violation. The Executive further agrees that, in the event any of the provisions of Sections 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to any applicable statute, law or rule, or for any reason to be unenforceable as written, such court may modify any of such provisions so as to permit enforcement thereof as thus modified. (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of Sections 11, 12, and 14 shall survive and remain in effect 13
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or a breach by the Company or the Executive of any other terms of this Agreement. Section 15. Parent Guarantee. The Parent hereby guarantees the Company's obligations under Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 23 of this Agreement. Section 16. Third Party Beneficiary. The Executive hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Parent shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made under Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this Agreement and that the Parent shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights hereunder. Section 17. Representations. (a) The Company and the Parent individually represent and warrant that each is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this Agreement and that the performance of the obligations of each under this Agreement will not violate any agreement between it and any other person, firm or organization. The Executive represents that the performance of his obligations under this Agreement will not violate any agreement between him and any other person, firm or organization that would be violated by the performance of his obligations under this Agreement. (b) None of the Executive or any of his immediate family members or affiliates (i) owns, controls or has any interest in any material asset or other property used in connection with the business of Nautica and its subsidiaries (other than assets being transferred pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) or (ii) has any material interest in any business (corporate or otherwise) that is in competition with the business of Nautica and its subsidiaries. Section 18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the Company and the Executive concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes the Transition Agreement and all prior agreements, understandings, discussions, negotiations and undertakings, whether written or oral, between the Company and the Executive with respect thereto. The Executive agrees and acknowledges that the Transition Agreement shall not be in force and effect and the Executive shall have no rights or entitlements to any payments, benefits or protections thereunder. Section 19. Amendment or Waiver. No provision in this Agreement may be amended unless such amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and an authorized officer of the Company. No waiver by the Company or by the Executive of any breach by the other party to this Agreement of any condition or provision contained in this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same or any prior or subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and 14
signed by the Executive or an authorized officer of the Company, as the case may be. Section 20. Severability. In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law so as to achieve the purposes of this Agreement. Section 21. Governing Law and Disputes. (a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New York without reference to principles of conflict of laws. (b) The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that the parties may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 22 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. Section 22. Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission and, if an electronic mail ("e-mail") address is given below, e-mail transmission, so long as receipt of such e-mail is requested and received) and shall be deemed given, if to the Parent, Company or the Division: c/o VF Corporation 105 Corporate Center Boulevard Greensboro, North Carolina 27408 Attention: Candace Cummings Facsimile No.: (336) 424-7696 E-mail: candace_cummings@vfc.com with a copy to: 15
