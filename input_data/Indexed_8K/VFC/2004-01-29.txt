ITEM 9 - Regulation FD Disclosure The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure" and Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." During its latest fiscal year, VF Corporation made the following filings that included certain non-GAAP performance measurements: - - Form 8-K dated April 22, 2003 presenting a press release disclosing operating results for the period ended April 5, 2003 - - Form 8-K dated July 22, 2003 presenting a press release disclosing operating results for the period ended July 5, 2003 - - Form 8-K dated October 23, 2003 presenting a press release disclosing operating results for the period ended October 4, 2003 - - Form 10-Q dated November 7, 2003 for the quarterly period ended October 4, 2003 The attached exhibits identify the non-GAAP performance measurements contained in those filings and provide reconciliations of each non-GAAP performance measure to the most directly comparable GAAP amount. In our internal evaluation of our operating results, including information presented to our Board of Directors, we present operating results of our individual business units excluding the effects of restructuring charges incurred, along with adjustments and gains directly related to those restructuring actions. Similarly, we may present a forecast of future operating results excluding the net effects of these restructuring charges. In addition, we may present operating results or various balance sheet amounts excluding the effects of foreign currency translation or excluding the effects of recent acquisitions. Operating results or financial position presented exclusive of these items is a measurement of financial performance that is not intended as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles. However, we believe that exclusion of these items provides useful information for comparing historical results for the periods presented and a basis for comparison with future periods. 2
