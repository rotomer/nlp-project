GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA - FEBRUARY 11, 2004 - VF CORPORATION (NYSE: VFC), the world's largest apparel company, today announced record results for the fourth quarter and record earnings for the full year 2003. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. Fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations rose 52% to $.96 per share, compared with $.63 per share in 2002. Income from continuing operations was $105.6 million versus $70.3 million in the 2002 period. Sales in the quarter rose 6% to $1,387.3 million versus $1,310.6 million in the prior year's quarter. Foreign currency translation benefited sales and earnings per share by $31 million and $.03, respectively, in the quarter. For the full year 2003, earnings from continuing operations rose to $3.61 per share, an increase of 11% over the $3.24 per share reported in 2002. Income from continuing operations was $397.9 million versus $364.4 million reported a year ago. Sales rose 2% to $5,207.5 million compared with the $5,083.5 million reported in the 2002 period. Foreign currency translation benefited sales and earnings per share by $128 million and $.14, respectively. The addition of Nautica contributed approximately $177 million in sales and $.11 per share to fourth quarter results, and $249 million in sales and $.16 per share to full year results. Commented Mackey J. McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer, "The contributions from our newer businesses, namely, Nautica and The North Face, are paying off in the form of higher sales and profits for our Company. At the same time our core businesses continue to enjoy healthy profitability and generate the strong cash flow we'll be using to fund our future growth." Mr. McDonald continued, "We expect continued growth in both sales and earnings in 2004. At the same time, we believe it is time to take a more aggressive approach to growth. Several months ago we launched an initiative within VF designed to surface substantial new growth opportunities within our
Page 2 of 7 February 11, 2004 coalitions, across coalitions and into new categories. We are developing specific plans to unlock the potential of our current brands, focus more heavily in certain geographic areas, find new ways to partner with our customers and step up the pace of acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio." BUSINESS REVIEW Total sales in 2003 rose 2%, a result of strong performance in our Outdoor businesses and the acquisition of Nautica. Sales in the Company's Outdoor coalition, which includes The North Face(R), JanSport(R) and Eastpak(R) brands, rose to $581 million in 2003 from $508 million in 2002, an increase of 14%. These results were driven by a sales increase of more than 25% in The North Face(R) brand globally and strong growth in our international businesses across each brand. Nautica performed better than we had anticipated. Nautica's sportswear business performed better than we planned; Nautica's men's jeanswear, retail and licensing businesses all performed well. The initial response by customers to our Fall 2004 line has been positive, and we are encouraged by our progress in addressing product and brand positioning issues. As anticipated, sales in our core businesses continued to reflect soft retail sales of apparel. Total jeans sales declined 4% to $2,667 million from $2,788 million. International jeans sales rose 5% from prior year levels due to favorable currency translations. As anticipated, domestic jeans sales declined 7%, reflecting competitive conditions at retail and a large number of store closings by a major customer. Global intimate apparel sales declined slightly, to $830 million in 2003 from $840 million. Sales in our Imagewear coalition also declined slightly. Occupational apparel sales declined 8%, while licensed sports apparel sales climbed 17%. We are continuing our negotiations for the sale of our Playwear and of our John Varvatos businesses. We anticipate the disposal of our Playwear business will impact earnings by approximately $.03 to $.05 per share in 2004. Gross margins improved by more than 100 basis points in 2003, rising to 37.4% from 36.0%, while operating margins rose to 12.4% from 12.2%. Earnings in 2003 also benefited from higher interest income and a lower tax rate, both resulting from favorable tax settlements received in the fourth quarter. VF's balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow remain very strong, particularly given the acquisition of Nautica in the third quarter. Our focus on inventory management has paid off: inventories at year-end were up 12% over prior year levels, with all of the increase resulting from the Nautica acquisition and foreign currency effects. At year-end, cash totaled $515 million. Debt as a percent of total capital was 33.7% at the end of the year; net of cash, debt was 19.6% of total capital. Cash flow from operations was $544 million, with Nautica adding approximately $60 million since being acquired. OUTLOOK We're looking forward to another record year in earnings in 2004, and are currently projecting a 5% increase in both earnings and sales. Sales growth will be driven primarily from the acquisition of Nautica, which is expected to contribute approximately $550 million to full year sales and at least $.16 to earnings per share in 2004. Our Outdoor businesses are also expecting another strong year of double-digit sales growth. Total jeanswear sales are expected to be about flat with prior year levels, with low-single digit sales
Page 3 of 7 February 11, 2004 increases expected in both global intimate apparel and imagewear. We also expect sales will reflect the exit of our Playwear business, which contributed approximately $141 million to sales in 2003. Operating margins in 2004 are expected to be up slightly, and reflect continued improvement in gross margins. We expect higher interest expense in 2004, due to higher long-term borrowings, and a tax rate of approximately 34.5%. Cash flow from operations is expected to range between $450 and $500 million. In terms of the first quarter, we currently expect sales to rise 8-10%. Reflecting the seasonal nature of Nautica's business and its dilutive impact on the first quarter, earnings are expected to be about flat with prior year levels. DIVIDEND DECLARED The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.26 per share, payable on March 19, 2004 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 9, 2004.
