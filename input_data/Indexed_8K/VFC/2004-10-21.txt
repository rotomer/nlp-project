Exhibit 99 VF Announces Record Third Quarter Sales and Earnings Per Share and Raises Dividend; Company Establishes New Long-term Sales Growth Target of 8% GREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 21, 2004--VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC): -- Third quarter sales rise 25%; EPS up 21% -- Gross margins expand to 40.2% from 37.4% -- Quarterly dividend increased by $.01 to $.27 per share -- Continue to expect record sales and EPS in 2004 -- High single digit sales and earnings growth expected in 2005 Information regarding VF's third quarter conference call webcast today and its investor meeting webcast tomorrow can be found at the end of this release. VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC), a leader in branded apparel, today announced record results for its third quarter and an aggressive growth plan designed to increase sales 8% annually. The Company is holding a meeting with investors on October 22 to review its growth plans in more detail. Commented Mackey J. McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer, "Our position has never been stronger. Our core businesses are in great shape -- most are growing, and they are highly profitable and generating healthy levels of cash flow. At the same time, we've identified and successfully completed several acquisitions of powerful lifestyle brands that offer terrific potential for future growth. We believe we have established a platform that will enable us to generate sales growth of 8% annually. Through our growth plan, we also have identified ways to more effectively leverage our global supply chain capabilities that could generate $100 million in cost savings over the next five years." Third quarter sales rose 25% to $1,792.6 million from $1,435.4 million in the prior year's third quarter. Net income increased 24% to $155.4 million from $125.3 million, with earnings per share rising 21% to $1.38 from $1.14. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. The Company saw solid growth in most of its core businesses, while the recent acquisitions of the Vans(R), Napapijri(R) and Kipling(R) brands added $183.6 million to sales in the quarter and $.12 to earnings per share. As anticipated, earnings reflect a $15.0 million or $.08 per share impact from the recognition of certain costs related to the disposition of the Company's Playwear business. For the first nine months of 2004, sales increased 18% to $4,494.8 million from $3,820.2 million. Net income rose 20% to $349.4 million from $292.3 million, with earnings per share rising 17% to $3.11 from $2.65. The results for the nine months include a net $7.6 million ($.04 per share) charge related to disposition of the Playwear business. "We are aggressively driving integration and growth plans for all of our acquired businesses, both in Outdoor and Sportswear, and are very pleased by the benefits we've seen to date," commented Mr. McDonald. "We are on or ahead of schedule in meeting our sales and operating margin goals, and remain extremely excited at the future growth prospects for all these brands." Third Quarter Business Review Outdoor Our Outdoor businesses continued their outstanding performance in the quarter. Combined sales of our Outdoor businesses, which include The North Face(R), Vans(R), JanSport(R), Eastpak(R), Napapijri(R) and Kipling(R) brands, jumped 116% in the quarter to $457 million from $212 million. The North Face(R) brand continued to show powerful momentum, with sales up 44%. The brand experienced growth across all product categories -- outerwear, sportswear, footwear and equipment. During the quarter a new store was added in Boston, with stores in Paris, Munich, Copenhagen, Innsbruck, Antwerp and Turin opened in conjunction with our retail customers. Spring bookings for the brand are up 22% in the U.S. and 23% in Europe. Sales in our Packs business also rose strongly in the quarter, with growth driven by travel and apparel products. Our Vans business is performing above our expectations, with double-digit sales growth in its core footwear business in the quarter. The Vans(R), Napapijri(R) and Kipling(R) brand acquisitions contributed $184 million to Outdoor sales in the quarter. Jeanswear Total Jeanswear sales, which include the Lee(R), Wrangler(R), Riders(R) and Rustler(R) brands, were $710 million, down slightly from $716 million in last year's third quarter. Domestic jeans sales slipped in the quarter, due in part to lower sales of distressed products, which also contributed to higher margins in the quarter. International jeans sales rose slightly due to favorable currency translations. We continue to expect an increase in fourth quarter sales for our total Jeanswear business, based on the recent rollouts of our Wrangler Jeans Co.(TM), Riders(R) Coppercollection(TM), "Buddy Lee Registered(TM)", "One True Fit(TM)" and "Ultimate 5" lines in the U.S. and a new line under the Lee(R) trademark in Europe. Sportswear Sales of our Sportswear businesses, which include the Nautica(R), Earl Jean(R) and John Varvatos(R) brands, were $167 million in the quarter and were $72 million in last year's third quarter, reflecting the inclusion of these brands for the full quarter in 2004 versus a partial quarter in the 2003 period. Sales per square foot and inventory turns for Nautica continue to improve, and profitability is up significantly even with a sharp increase in brand investment. Global Intimates Our Global Intimate apparel business continued its strong growth trend in the quarter. Sales rose 12% to $235 million from $210 million in the prior year's third quarter. Our private brands, mass channel, department store and international businesses all reported higher sales in the period. Strong new products and distinctive brand positioning are fueling growth for the Vassarette(R), Vanity Fair(R), Lily of France(R) and Bestform(R) brands. Our newest brand, Curvation(TM), is now in its second year and continues to grow through expanded distribution and new sport and strapless bra products. Imagewear Sales in our Imagewear coalition also rose in the quarter, up 5% to $192 million from $183 million last year. Continuing the positive trend we saw in the second quarter, occupational apparel sales rose 3% to $107 million from $104 million in 2003, with growth coming from new apparel programs with large multinational companies and government agencies. Overall profitability was strong in the quarter, with improvements in operating margins across most of our core businesses. Gross margins are benefiting from the acquisitions of strong lifestyle brands, where gross margins tend to be higher than in some of our category-driven businesses. Gross margins in the quarter improved by nearly 300 basis points, rising to 40.2% from 37.4%. Royalty income increased, primarily due to the full quarter contribution of licensing income from Nautica. Operating margins were down slightly compared with prior year levels, reflecting the aforementioned $15 million in costs related to the disposition of our Playwear business. We also continued our investments in our growth plan in the quarter; as anticipated, these costs totaled approximately $13 million. VF's balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow remain in excellent condition. Inventories actually declined 1%, despite the addition of $58 million of inventories from the acquisitions of Vans, Napapijri and Kipling. Inventories in our core businesses declined 6% in the quarter from the third quarter of 2003. We generated strong cash flow from continuing operations of $298 million in the first three quarters of 2004. We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations could approximate $550 million in 2004. Debt as a percent of total capital was 31.9% at the end of the quarter. Outlook We continue to expect a record year in sales and earnings in 2004. Full year sales are expected to increase 15%, approaching the $6 billion mark for the year. Earnings per share are expected to rise approximately 12% over prior year levels. The acquisitions of the Vans(R), Napapijri(R) and Kipling(R) brands are now expected to contribute approximately $285 million to sales and $.14 to earnings per share this year, above our previous expectations. For the fourth quarter, we now expect a sales increase of approximately 8%, with earnings per share about flat with last year's fourth quarter. Growth plan spending could approximate $20 million in the quarter. Areas of continued investment include brand marketing, new customer team initiatives and supply chain projects. In addition, results in the fourth quarter of 2003 included a favorable tax settlement, which benefited earnings by $.07 per share. Based on the current momentum within our businesses and the variety of initiatives underway within our growth plan, we currently anticipate that both sales and earnings could increase at high single-digit rates in 2005. Margins should benefit as the profitability of our recent acquisitions continues to improve and our supply chain initiatives take hold. At the same time, we will continue to invest behind our brands and businesses to ensure they remain healthy and growing. Additional details regarding our outlook for 2005 will be provided at the time of our year-end earnings release in mid-February. Dividend Increase The Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate of $.01 to $.27 per share. This marks the 14th consecutive year that the Company has increased its quarterly dividend rate. The cash dividend is payable on December 20, 2004 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 10, 2004.
