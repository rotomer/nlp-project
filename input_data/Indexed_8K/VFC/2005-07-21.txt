Exhibit 99 VF Reports Record Second Quarter Sales and Earnings and Declares Dividend Business Editors/Fashion Editors GREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 21, 2005--VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC): -- Second quarter sales rise 13% -- EPS up 10%, including special items -- Gross margins up two full percentage points to 41.4% -- Acquisitions continue strong performance Information regarding VF's second quarter conference call webcast today can be found at the end of this release. VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC), a global leader in branded apparel, today announced record results for its second quarter ended July 2, 2005. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. Second quarter sales rose 13% to $1,435.8 million from $1,269.5 million in the prior year's second quarter. Net income increased 11% to $100.0 million from $90.1 million, with earnings per share rising 10% to $.88 from $.80. Second quarter earnings include a net benefit of $.07 per share from special items, detailed below. Similarly, second quarter EPS in 2004 included a net benefit of $.04 per share related to the exit of our Playwear business. The acquisitions of the Vans(R), Napapijri(R), Kipling(R), Reef(R) and Holoubek businesses added $156 million to sales and $.09 to earnings per share in the 2005 quarter. For the first six months of 2005, sales increased 11% to $2,999.5 million from $2,702.2 million. Net income rose 15% to $222.9 million from $194.0 million, with earnings per share rising 13% to $1.95 from $1.73. The above acquisitions contributed $312 million to sales and $.20 to earnings per share in the first half of 2005. "We are delighted to report another record quarter," commented Mackey J. McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our strategy to transform VF into a higher growth, more dynamic company is working: we're investing behind our core brands to maintain their leadership positions and at the same time using our operational and brand management skills to effectively integrate and grow our new brands. Most of our core businesses are strong, healthy and operating at very profitable levels, and our acquisitions are clearly delivering on their potential." He continued, "Earnings rose more than we anticipated during the quarter, due to particularly robust sales in our Outdoor and Sportswear coalitions, which in turn are driving higher gross margins. Two noteworthy examples in the quarter were our Vans(R) brand, where we are benefiting from very strong product launches and the success of a new retail merchandising format, and our Nautica(R) brand, where we experienced a double-digit sales gain and a big improvement in profitability. We also are gratified by the sales increase posted by our U.S. jeanswear business during the quarter." The second quarter 2005 special items referred to above consist of the following: Net Income Per (In millions) Share ----------------------- Settlements of income tax matters in foreign jurisdictions $12.5 $.11 Tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings - American Jobs Creation Act (7.0) (.06) Reduction of accruals related to postemployment benefits in Mexico 9.4 .08 Capacity alignment actions, principally in intimate apparel (7.2) (.06) ----------------------- Total $7.7 $.07 ======================= Second Quarter Business Review Jeanswear Total Jeanswear sales, which include the Wrangler(R), Lee(R), Riders(R), Rustler(R), H.I.S(R), Maverick(R) and Old Axe(R) brands, rose 2% in the quarter, to $597 million versus $586 million in last year's second quarter, with increases in both international and domestic jeans sales. Sales in our Mass Market and Western Specialty businesses were robust, while our Lee(R) brand business declined. The increase in international jeans sales resulted from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Jeanswear operating income increased 9%, including the aforementioned reductions in benefit accruals that were greater than required by local laws. The effect in any prior period was not significant. Outdoor Our Outdoor businesses had another excellent quarter. Sales doubled in the quarter to $297 million from $146 million, with the acquisitions of the Vans(R), Kipling(R), Reef(R) and Napapijri(R) brands contributing $138 million of the increase. Our Vans(R) and Kipling(R) brands had exceptionally strong results and continue to outpace our expectations. The Reef(R) brand acquisition, which was completed in April 2005, contributed $25 million to sales in the quarter. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 9%, driven by strong growth in The North Face(R) and JanSport(R) brands. Operating income rose 97%, with a slight decline in margins reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. Intimate Apparel Sales in our Intimate Apparel business, which includes our Vanity Fair(R), Vassarette(R), Lily of France(R), Bestform(R) and Curvation(R) brands, declined 5% in the quarter, to $223 million from $235 million. We have noted previously that 2004 results benefited from a large new product launch with a specialty store customer, which will result in difficult sales and profit comparisons throughout 2005. The 61% decline in operating income and lower margins primarily result from the lower sales and aggressive actions taken to align capacity and reduce costs. We expect comparisons in the second half of the year to improve versus the first half. Imagewear Our Imagewear coalition reported a 4% sales increase in the quarter, to $181 million from $173 million. The increase in sales was a result of the January 2005 acquisition of the assets of a licensee of the Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., which drove a double-digit sales gain in our licensed sports apparel business. Occupational apparel sales were about flat in the quarter. Operating income rose 16% as we continue to lower product costs and leverage a very solid business platform. Sportswear Sales of our Sportswear businesses, which include the Nautica(R) and John Varvatos(R) brands, as well as Kipling(R) brand sales in North America, increased 22% in the quarter, to $127 million from $105 million. Each Nautica business unit - Men's Sportswear, Jeans, Furnishings and Retail - experienced solid gains in the quarter. The John Varvatos(R) men's luxury sportswear business also continued its rapid sales growth in the quarter. Operating income increased sharply to $19 million, or 15.1% of sales, compared to $1 million in last year's second quarter. Both sales and operating income in the 2004 quarter included the negative impact of an acquisition-related adjustment of $7 million. Overall gross margins for VF increased by two full percentage points in the quarter, to 41.4% from 39.4%, with the improvement coming primarily from growth in our higher margin businesses. Operating margins declined to 11.1% from 11.8% in the prior year period, primarily due to the lower margins in our Intimates business in the current quarter. The tax rate for the 2005 period declined to 29.6% from 32.1% due to the net impact of the income tax settlements and repatriation of foreign earnings, as detailed above. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, and we ended the quarter with $250 million in cash. Inventories were up 8% over June 2004 levels, with $23 million of the total increase of $82 million due to the 2005 acquisitions. Debt as a percent of total capital was 29.9% at the end of the quarter, or 24.9% net of cash. During the quarter we repaid $100 million of long-term debt and will repay another $300 million that becomes due on October 1, 2005. During the quarter we repurchased one million shares of common stock, bringing the total shares repurchased year-to-date to two million. We expect to repurchase an additional two million shares over the balance of the year. Outlook For the full year, we continue to expect another record year in both sales and earnings. Sales are expected to rise approximately 7%, excluding any additional acquisitions. We anticipate that sales in the second half of the year will be up approximately 4%, which includes the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar versus our prior expectations. We expect comparable increases in both the third and fourth quarters. We now expect that earnings will rise about 10% in 2005 to approximately $4.65 per share, reflecting both continued strong performance across most of our businesses during the second half and the special items reported in the most recent quarter. Third quarter EPS should rise approximately 12%, including an $.08 per share impact from the recognition of certain costs related to the disposition of our Playwear business reported in the third quarter of 2004. Dividend Declared The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.27 per share, payable on September 19, 2005 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 9, 2005.
