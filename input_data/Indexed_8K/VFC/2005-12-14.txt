Exhibit 99 VF Announces Sales and Earnings Guidance for 2006 GREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 14, 2005--VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC): -- Reaffirms EPS guidance of approximately $4.65 for 2005 -- Establishes EPS guidance for 2006 of approximately $4.95 -- 2006 sales expected to rise 4-5%, excluding additional acquisitions VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC), a global leader in branded apparel, reaffirmed sales and earnings guidance for 2005 and established sales and earnings guidance for 2006, concurrent with its investor meeting to be held today. All estimates exclude the impact of adopting FASB Statement 123(R), which requires the recognition of costs for stock options. The Company is maintaining its expectation for an increase in earnings of about 10% for 2005 to approximately $4.65 per share. Sales for 2005 should rise 5 to 6%. Consistent with guidance issued on October 21, 2005, the Company expects sales in the fourth quarter to rise about 2%, while earnings per share should be flat to up slightly over the $1.10 reported in the same period a year ago. For 2006, the Company anticipates sales growth of about 4 to 5%, excluding any additional acquisitions. Net earnings on a fully diluted basis are expected to increase about 6% to approximately $4.95 per share, also excluding any additional acquisitions. "We're very pleased to be on track to report a record year in sales and earnings in 2005 and to build upon that success for another record year in 2006," said Mackey J. McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer. "We will continue to leverage our strong cash flows from our current portfolio to deliver growth in our lifestyle brands, while also continuing to search for acquisitions that fit our strategic vision and meet our financial criteria." Management will provide additional details about its 2006 outlook when it releases full year 2005 financial results on February 8, 2006.
