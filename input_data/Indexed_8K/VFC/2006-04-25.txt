Exhibit 99 VF Announces Record First Quarter Revenues and Earnings, Declares Dividend and Raises Full Year Guidance GREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2006--VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC): -- 1Q EPS up 14%; revenues rise 5% -- Operating margins expand to 12.2% from 11.8% -- 2006 EPS guidance raised to $4.95 Information regarding VF's first quarter conference call webcast today can be found at the end of this release. VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC), a global leader in branded lifestyle apparel, today announced record results for the first quarter of 2006. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. Income rose 12% to a record $128.2 million from $114.7 million before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy for stock compensation expense, with earnings per share rising 14% to $1.14 from $1.00. Reflecting the cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2005, net income in the 2005 period was $102.9 million, equal to $.89 per share. Total revenues increased 5% in the current quarter, to $1,665.7 million compared with $1,582.2 million in the 2005 quarter. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenues by approximately $30 million, or 2%, and earnings per share by $.02 in the 2006 quarter. "We are delighted to start the year off on such a positive note, with earnings well in excess of the initial guidance we gave in February," said Mackey J. McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our growth strategy clearly has momentum, which should continue to build as the year progresses. Importantly, our performance this year is being driven by strong organic growth. Our results this quarter have given us increased confidence in our ability to deliver even stronger revenues and earnings this year than previously anticipated, while at the same time giving us the opportunity to significantly step up the investments behind our most important growth initiatives." First Quarter Business Review Outdoor Our Outdoor team delivered another outstanding quarter. Total revenues increased 35% in the quarter, driven by particularly strong global growth in The North Face(R), Vans(R) and Napapijri(R) brands and by the addition of the Reef(R) brand, acquired in April 2005, which contributed $42 million to revenues in the quarter. Revenues of The North Face(R) brand grew approximately 40%, while revenues of our Vans(R) and Napapijri(R) brands both achieved mid-teen percentage growth rates. Our packs business also grew modestly in the quarter, driven by higher Eastpak(R) brand sales in Europe. The strong volume gains achieved by The North Face(R) and Vans(R) brands were the primary drivers behind a 59% increase in operating income in the quarter, with total Outdoor operating margins rising two full percentage points to 13.1%. Sportswear Each of our Sportswear businesses, which include our Nautica(R) and John Varvatos(R) brands, as well as Kipling(R) brand sales in North America, achieved higher revenues in the quarter. Our Nautica(R) branded wholesale business, including men's sportswear, increased revenues in the quarter at a low single digit rate, with strong sales of our spring product offerings partially offset by slightly lower revenues in Nautica(R) brand retail stores. As anticipated, operating income and operating margins declined in the quarter, due primarily to investments to support the upcoming launch of Nautica(R) brand women's sportswear and our Nautica(R), Kipling(R) and John Varvatos(R) brands' retail store strategies. In addition, margins reflected increased promotional activity in our Nautica(R) brand retail stores during the quarter. Jeanswear We are very pleased with the overall performance of our Jeanswear coalition, which includes our Wrangler(R), Lee(R), Riders(R), Rustler(R) and Wrangler Hero(R) brands. Domestic jeans revenues rose slightly in the quarter, as we continued to experience solid gains in our domestic Mass Market and Western Specialty businesses. While down from prior year levels, Lee(R) brand domestic revenues were better than anticipated and we expect improved top line comparisons beginning in the second quarter. Total Jeanswear revenues were down slightly from prior levels reflecting currency translation effects that negatively impacted revenues by approximately $15 million. Total Jeanswear operating income rose 5% in the quarter reflecting higher sales of full priced products, with operating margins rising to 17.5% from 16.4%. Intimate Apparel Our Intimate Apparel business posted difficult revenues and profit comparisons as expected, with our Private Brands business continuing to be the primary driver behind the revenue decline. We continue to anticipate more stable performance for the remainder of the year. Our management team is highly focused on returning this business to traditional levels of profitability and renewing growth in our strong brands, including Vanity Fair(R), Lily of France(R), Vassarette(R), Bestform(R) and Curvation(R). Imagewear Our Imagewear coalition delivered another excellent quarter. Revenues rose 4%, with the gain due to a strong increase in sales of Image apparel, which includes uniforms for the industrial, public safety and service markets. Operating margins remained strong, at 15.5% in the quarter, with operating income about flat with prior year levels. Gross margins were 42.1% in both the 2006 and 2005 periods. Operating income rose 9% in the quarter, with operating margins increasing to 12.2% from 11.8%. Income rose 12% before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting policy for stock compensation expense in 2005, reflecting lower net interest expense in the current period. Our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape. Inventories rose 6% versus the comparable quarter in 2005, 2% of which was due to the acquisition of the Reef(R) brand. Debt as a percent of total capital was 24.7% at the end of the quarter. Outlook Based on our strong performance this quarter, we are raising our full year guidance for both revenues and earnings. We now expect revenues to expand 6 to 7%, driven primarily by the momentum in our Outdoor coalition and stronger than anticipated revenues in our domestic Jeanswear business. We also continue to expect that our Imagewear and Sportswear businesses will achieve revenue gains over 2005 levels. "We are committed to maintaining the positive momentum behind our growth strategy and believe the best means of doing so is to continue to invest behind our brands. Accordingly, we plan to invest an additional $20 million this year in increased advertising behind our Jeanswear brands as well as to support a variety of growth initiatives in our Outdoor business," said Mr. McDonald. Previously, we had anticipated an increase in 2006 earnings per share of approximately 6% over the $4.54 reported in 2005 before the cumulative effect adjustment. We are now expecting a 9% increase to approximately $4.95 per share. We're looking forward to a very strong performance in the second half and expect a 7 to 8% percent increase in revenues and approximately 10% increase in earnings per share. The fourth quarter is expected to be particularly strong. Earnings comparisons for the second quarter of 2006 will reflect the impact of special items that benefited net income by $7.7 million, or $.07 per share, in the prior year's quarter. Considering those special items, we currently expect second quarter earnings per share to be about flat with the $0.85 per share reported in the second quarter of 2005. Revenues should rise by 6 to 7%. We continue to anticipate another solid year of cash flow from operations, which should approximate $600 million in 2006. Dividend Declared The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.29 per share, payable on June 19, 2006 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 9, 2006.
