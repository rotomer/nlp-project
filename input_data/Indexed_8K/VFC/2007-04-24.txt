Exhibit 99 VF Announces Record First Quarter and Declares Dividend -- Revenues rise 15%, driven by 40% increase in Outdoor revenues, strong Jeanswear growth and acquisitions -- EPS from continuing operations up 11% to $1.17 -- Raising full year guidance Information regarding VF's first quarter conference call webcast today at 2 p.m. can be found at the end of this release. GREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2007--VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC), a global leader in branded lifestyle apparel, today announced record results for the first quarter of 2007 ended March 31, 2007. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis and, unless otherwise noted, reflect continuing operations. Revenues rose 15% to a record $1,673.6 million, compared with $1,455.6 million in the first quarter of 2006, driven by higher revenues across our Outdoor, Jeanswear and Imagewear businesses. Income from continuing operations in the current quarter increased 13% to a record $134.1 million, compared with $118.1 million in the prior year's quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations also rose 11%, to a record $1.17 from $1.05 last year. The Majestic Athletic acquisition contributed $.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. As previously disclosed, VF completed the sale of its intimate apparel business on April 1, 2007. Reflecting discontinued operations, net income was $138.3 million, or $1.20 per share, compared with $128.2 million, or $1.14 per share. "We're off to a strong start for the year," said Mackey J. McDonald, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We completed the sale of our Intimates business and made two acquisitions. Organic growth was 12% in the quarter - better than our initial guidance of 10% - while acquisitions added an additional three percentage points of growth to our top line. We are looking forward to continuing the momentum and delivering another record year of revenues and earnings to our shareholders." First Quarter Business Review Outdoor The momentum continues in our Outdoor coalition, with total revenues up 40% to $538.8 million and strong gains across nearly every brand. Domestic revenues grew 31% in the quarter, while international revenues rose 52%. The North Face(R), Vans(R), Kipling(R) , Reef(R), Napapijri(R) and Eastpak(R) brands each posted double-digit revenue gains in the quarter. The acquisition of the Eagle Creek(R) brand of adventure travel gear added $6 million to revenues in the quarter. Operating income jumped 66% in the quarter, and operating margins expanded sharply reflecting the strong revenue gain. Jeanswear Our Jeanswear coalition, which includes our Wrangler(R), Lee(R) and Riders(R) brands, posted an 8% gain in revenues during the quarter. Domestic revenues rose 5%, with healthy increases in both our Mass Market and Lee businesses. International revenues grew 14%, with double-digit growth in both our Wrangler(R) and Lee(R) brands in Europe. Jeanswear revenues in Asia were up over 30%, and our joint venture in India also contributed to revenues in the quarter. Overall Jeanswear operating income rose 5%. Sportswear Total revenues of our Sportswear coalition, which includes our Nautica(R) and John Varvatos(R) brands as well as the Kipling(R) brand in North America, declined 9% in the quarter. Our Kipling(R) and John Varvatos(R) businesses each posted double-digit revenue gains. As planned, revenues of our Nautica(R) brand business declined in the quarter, due primarily to a shift in shipping dates by most of the brand's customers, as well as lower sales of distressed inventory. We continue to target a mid-single digit revenue increase for the year for the coalition and expect more positive comparisons in both revenues and profits in the second half of 2007. Reflecting the lower revenues, as well as the sustained investments in our Nautica(R) women's sportswear initiative, operating income for the coalition declined in the quarter. Imagewear Total revenues of our Imagewear coalition rose 10% due to the recent acquisition of the Majestic Athletic business. The leading global provider of authentic sports licensed apparel and branded team uniforms for Major League Baseball, Majestic Athletic contributed $27 million to revenues in the quarter. Imagewear operating income rose slightly in the quarter, largely due to the aforementioned acquisition. Gross margins and operating margins were essentially flat with prior year levels, at 43.5% and 12.9%, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted earnings per share by $0.05 in the quarter, while a higher tax rate and higher average shares outstanding negatively impacted earnings per share by $.02 and $.03, respectively. During the quarter we repurchased 2 million shares as part of our plan to use the $350 million in proceeds from the sale of our Intimates business to repurchase our shares this year. Our balance sheet continues to be very healthy. The increase in inventories is consistent with the increase in revenues, after taking into account the impact of our recent acquisitions. Accounts receivable, before the impact of recent acquisitions, were above prior year levels by 15%, due primarily to the strong revenue growth, particularly in our international businesses where payment terms are longer than those of our U.S. businesses. Debt as a percent of total capital was 24% at the end of the quarter, compared with 25% at the end of the comparable period in 2006. Leveraging our strong brands through a growing base of retail stores continues to be a strategic priority for VF. We ended the quarter with 533 owned retail stores. Our total retail revenues grew 19% in the quarter, with particularly strong growth in our Vans(R) brand stores. Outlook With the positive momentum of the first quarter and the acquisitions of the Majestic(R) and Eagle Creek(R) brands, we now believe revenues for the year will approximate $7 billion, an increase of over 12%. We continue to expect healthy organic growth in all our coalitions, and our two acquisitions should contribute $180 million to revenues in 2007. We are also raising our guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations from our prior guidance of a 10% increase to a 12% increase. We continue to expect a very strong year of cash flow from operations of approximately $625 million. In terms of our second quarter, revenues should be up 14%. Earnings per share from continuing operations should increase 8% reflecting the seasonality of recent acquisitions and the timing of investments and other SG&A spending that will affect the operating margins of this seasonally lowest quarter of the year. We expect operating margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points for the full year, even with the impact of recent acquisitions that have not yet realized their full profit potential. Dividend Declared The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $.55 per share, payable on June 18, 2007 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 8, 2007.

In addition, the funded status of the plans and adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income in the March 2007 balance sheet, as well as the 2007 pension expense, were determined using the December 2006 valuation. Accrued income taxes - During the first quarter of 2007, VF adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, and recorded a $4.4 million charge to Retained Earnings at the beginning of 2007.
