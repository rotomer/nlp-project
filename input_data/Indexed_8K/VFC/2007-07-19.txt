Exhibit 99 VF Announces Record Second Quarter and Declares Dividend -- Revenues Rise 12%, with Growth across All Businesses -- EPS from Continuing Operations up 16% to $.93, Including $.04 Gain from Sale of H.I.S(R) Brand in Europe -- Maintaining 2007 Guidance of 12% Growth in Both Revenues and EPS Information Regarding VF's Second Quarter Conference Call Webcast Today at 8:30 A.M. Can Be Found at the End of This Release. GREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2007--VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC), a global leader in branded lifestyle apparel, today announced results for the second quarter and first six months of 2007 ended June 30, 2007. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis and, unless otherwise noted, reflect continuing operations. Revenues rose 12% to a record $1,517.4 million, compared with $1,351.3 million in the second quarter of 2006, driven by higher revenues across our Outdoor, Jeanswear, Sportswear and Imagewear businesses. Income from continuing operations in the current quarter increased 18% to a record $105.8 million, compared with $89.6 million in the prior year's quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose 16%, to a record $.93 from $.80 last year and included a $.04 gain from the sale of the H.I.S(R) trademarks and related intellectual property in Europe. Reflecting the impact of our discontinued intimate apparel business, the sale of which was concluded in the second quarter, net income was $81.7 million, or $.72 per share, compared with $99.0 million, or $.88 per share in the prior year quarter. For the first half of 2007, revenues rose 14% to a record $3,191.0 million from $2,806.9 million. Income from continuing operations increased 15% to $239.9 million, compared with $207.7 million in the prior year period. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose 14% to $2.10. Net income, including the effects of discontinued operations in both periods, was $220.0 million, or $1.93 per share, compared with $227.2 million, or $2.02 per share in the prior year period. Year-to-date, the impact from discontinued operations was a net loss of $19.9 million, or $.17 per share. Considering the anticipated gain on assets yet to be sold throughout the remainder of the year, the projected impact from discontinued operations for the full year is an estimated loss of $.07 per share. "The success of our brand portfolio management strategy is evidenced by another record quarter. Our core businesses, which remain strong and healthy, and the brands we have acquired over the last several years continue to drive tremendous shareholder value. Most importantly, we continue to see substantial opportunities for growth, particularly across our lifestyle brands," said Mackey J. McDonald, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our two most recent acquisitions, the Eagle Creek(R) and Majestic(R) businesses, are performing very well, and we remain confident in our ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate additional brands with strong growth potential." Second Quarter Business Review Outdoor Total revenues grew strongly in the quarter, up 20% to $446.8 million. Domestic revenues grew 10% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in The North Face(R) and Reef(R) brands and continued strong growth in our Vans(R) brand. JanSport(R) brand revenues declined in the quarter, due primarily to a shift in the timing of product shipments into the third quarter. The acquisition of the Eagle Creek(R) brand of adventure travel gear added $10 million to revenues in the quarter. International revenues rose 48%, with The North Face(R), Vans(R), Kipling(R), Napapijri(R), Eastpak(R) and Reef(R) brands each growing in excess of 35%. Outdoor operating income grew 25% in the quarter, reflecting the strong increase in revenues. Jeanswear Revenues in our Jeanswear coalition, which includes our Wrangler(R), Lee(R) and Riders(R) brands, rose 3%. The increase was driven by a 14% increase in international revenues in the quarter, led by continued strong performance of our Lee brand and rapid growth in emerging markets such as China, Russia and India. Foreign currency translation also contributed to the international revenue gain, accounting for about half of the increase. Domestic revenues were flat in the quarter, with revenues in our Lee, Mass Market and Western Specialty businesses each approximately even with prior year levels. Jeanswear operating income rose 14%, with a strong increase in operating margins resulting from restructuring actions taken in prior periods. Sportswear Total revenues of our Sportswear coalition, which includes our Nautica(R) and John Varvatos(R) brands as well as the Kipling(R) brand in North America, rose 9% in the quarter. Our Kipling(R) and John Varvatos(R) businesses each posted revenue gains in excess of 25%, and revenues of our Nautica(R) branded business grew 6%. Operating income rose 5% in the quarter, with operating margins slightly below prior year levels due to continued investments to build our women's sportswear business. Imagewear Total revenues of our Imagewear coalition rose 22% due to the February 2007 acquisition of the Majestic Athletic business, which contributed $45 million to revenues in the quarter. Imagewear operating income and margins declined in the quarter compared with the very strong results in last year's second quarter, reflecting business and product mix changes in the current quarter. Operating income and margin comparisons for the second half of the year are expected to improve substantially. Operating income, which includes a $7.5 million gain from the H.I.S(R) sale, rose 16% in the quarter. Including this gain, operating margins rose to 11.1% from 10.8%. During the quarter we concluded the share repurchase that utilized the proceeds from the sale of our Intimates business. We repurchased 2.1 million shares in the second quarter, bringing the total number of shares repurchased this year to 4.1 million. Our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape. Our debt to total capital ratio remains low, providing us with the flexibility to continue to pursue acquisitions to further build our portfolio with higher growth lifestyle brands and enhance shareholder value. Debt as a percent of total capital was 20% at June 2007, compared with 25% at June 2006. A key growth strategy for VF is to expand our direct-to-consumer business primarily through retail store expansion. We continue to grow our retail store base, ending the quarter with 544 owned retail stores, up from 533 at the end of the first quarter. Our retail revenues grew 22% in the quarter, with strong growth in our Vans(R), Nautica(R) and The North Face(R) brand stores. Outlook We continue to expect a fifth consecutive year of record results, with healthy organic growth. We are taking a cautious outlook regarding retail and consumer trends for the second half of the year by maintaining our guidance for a 12% increase in both revenues and EPS. We're looking forward to a record third quarter, with revenues expected to rise approximately 12%, while earnings per share from continuing operations should increase 10%. Operating margins should be strong and stable in the quarter, while the tax rate will be slightly higher, reflecting credits recorded in the prior year period. We also continue to expect a very strong year of cash flow from operations of approximately $625 million. Dividend Declared The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $.55 per share, payable on September 20, 2007 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 10, 2007.
