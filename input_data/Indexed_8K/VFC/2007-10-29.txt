     On October 26, 2007, VF Corporation (the "Company"), as guarantor, and VF Investments S.A.R.L., VF Europe BVBA, and VF International S.A.G.L. (the "Borrowers"), as borrowers, entered into a Credit Agreement with the lenders named therein (the "Lenders"), J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as Administrative Agent (the "Agent"), ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Documentation Agent, and HSBC Bank PLC, as Syndication Agent. The Credit Agreement has a stated termination date of October 26, 2012. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers may request two extensions of the stated termination date for additional periods of one year each. Under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have agreed to provide advances in an aggregate principal amount of up to 250 million. Borrowings may be in Euros, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars or any other freely available currency. Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be at the Euribor rate or the applicable offshore rate, plus an applicable margin and commitment fees are also payable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes of the Borrowers, including, without limitation, acquisitions. In connection with the Credit Agreement entered on October 26, 2007, the Borrowers' Credit Agreement dated as of October 27, 2005 (the "Old Credit Agreement") was terminated on October 26, 2007. The Old Credit Agreement was by and among the Company, as guarantor, the Borrowers and VF Asia Ltd., as borrowers, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Administrative Agent and Documentation Agent, Barclays Capital as Syndication Agent and the Lenders party thereto from time to time. Under the Old Credit Agreement, which was scheduled to terminate by its terms on October 27, 2010, the lenders agreed to provide term loans in the amount of $40 million and 40 million and revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to 175million; all of the other terms and conditions were substantially similar to the Credit Agreement entered into on October 26, 2007.
     The terms of the Credit Agreement include representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including certain financial covenants) and events of default that are customary for credit facilities of this nature. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an event of default, including but not limited to nonpayment of principal when due, failure to perform or observe certain terms, covenants or agreements under the Credit Agreement, and certain defaults on other indebtedness, the Agent may terminate the obligation of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement to make advances and declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. In addition, in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Company or the Borrowers or any significant subsidiary of the Company under applicable bankruptcy laws, the obligation of each Lender to make advances shall automatically terminate and any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement shall immediately become due and payable.
     The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Each Loan shall be in an amount of at least 5,000,000 (or the Euro Equivalent Amount thereof in any Alternative Currency), and, if greater than 5,000,000, an integral multiple of 1,000,000 (or the Euro Equivalent Amount thereof in any Alternative Currency).
Amounts
          (c) . (i) An Authorized Representative of a Borrower shall give the Agent at least three (3) Business Days' irrevocable telephonic notice of each Loan to such Borrower (or, in the case of any Loan denominated in any currency determined to be an Alternative Currency after the date hereof, such greater notice period reasonably determined by the Agent to be necessary), whether representing an additional borrowing or the Continuation of a borrowing hereunder, prior to 1:00 P.M. (London time).
Loans
Each such notice shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent, shall specify the identity of the Borrower, the amount of the borrowing, the Type of Loan (Euribor Rate if such Loan is requested in Euros, or Offshore Rate if such Loan is requested in an Alternative Currency), the date of borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the Interest Period to be used in the computation of interest, and if an Offshore Rate Loan, the applicable Alternative Currency. The Authorized Representative of the applicable Borrower shall provide the Agent written confirmation of each such telephonic notice in the form of a Borrowing Notice or Interest Rate Selection Notice (as applicable) with appropriate insertions not later than one (1) Business Day prior to the requested borrowing day. Notice of receipt of such Borrowing Notice or Interest Rate Selection Notice, as the case may be, together with a specification of the amount of each Lender's portion of a Loan requested thereunder, shall be provided by the Agent to each Lender by telefacsimile transmission with reasonable promptness, but (provided the Agent shall have received such notice by 1:00 P.M.

Not later than 5:00 P.M. (London time) two (2) Business Days preceding the date specified for each Loan of an Alternative Currency, the Agent shall provide the applicable Borrower and each Lender notice by telefacsimile transmission of the Borrowing Date Exchange Rate applicable to such Loan, and the applicable Alternative Currency Equivalent Amount of the Loan or Loans required to be made by each Lender on such date, and the Euro Equivalent Amount of such Loan or Loans and the applicable Offshore Rate.
          (ii) (A) In the case of Loans in Euros, not later than 10:00 A.M. (London time) on the date specified for each borrowing under this Section 2.1, each Lender shall, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, make the amount of the Loan or Loans to be made by it on such day available by wire transfer to the Agent in the amount of its pro rata share, determined according to such Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage of the Loan or Loans to be made on such day. Such wire transfer shall be directed to the Agent at the Principal Office and shall be in the form of Euros constituting immediately available funds. The amount so received by the Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be
 
made available to the applicable Borrower by delivery no later than 4:00 P.M. (London time) of the proceeds thereof to the applicable Borrower's Account or otherwise as shall be directed in the applicable Borrowing Notice by the Authorized Representative of such Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Agent.
     (B) In the case of Loans in an Alternative Currency, not later than 10:00 A.M. (London time) on the date specified for each Loan, each Lender shall, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, make the amount of the Loan or Loans to be made by it on such day available to the applicable Borrower at the Funding Bank, to the account of the Agent with the Funding Bank. The amount so received by the Funding Bank shall, subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents and upon instruction from the Agent to the Funding Bank on the same day or immediately preceding day but no later than 4:00 P.M. (London time), be made available to the applicable Borrower by delivery of the Alternative Currency Equivalent Amount to such Borrower's account with the Funding Bank.
          (iii) If requested by the applicable Borrower through the Agent, before 1:00 P.M. (London time) at least four Business Days before the beginning of any Interest Period applicable to a Euribor Rate Loan or Offshore Rate Loan, as the case may be, each Lender will advise the Agent before 10:00 A.M. (London time) three Business Days preceding the beginning of such Interest Period as to whether, if the Borrower selects an Interest Period of nine or twelve months, such Lender expects that deposits in Euros or the applicable Alternative Currency, as the case may be, with a term corresponding to such Interest Period will be available to it two Business Days preceding such Interest Period in the amount and for the duration required to fund the Euribor Rate Loan or Offshore Rate Loan, as the case may be, to which such Interest Period would apply. If, but only if, each Lender confirms that it expects such deposits to be available to it on terms acceptable to such Lender, in its own discretion, then such Borrower shall be entitled to select a duration of nine or twelve months for such Interest Period.
          (d) . The principal amount of each Loan shall be due and payable to the Agent for the benefit of each Lender in full on the Termination Date applicable to such Lender, or earlier as specifically provided herein. The principal amount of any Loan may be prepaid without penalty or premium in whole or in part on any Business Day, upon at least three (3) Business Days' irrevocable telephonic notice from an Authorized Representative of the applicable Borrower (effective upon receipt) to the Agent prior to 1:00 P.M. (London time). The Agent shall give the Lenders prompt notice of all such notices of prepayment. Such Authorized Representative shall provide the Agent written confirmation of each such telephonic notice not later than one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed prepayment day. All prepayments of Loans made by a Borrower shall be in the Euro Equivalent Amount of 5,000,000 or such greater Euro Equivalent Amount which is an integral multiple of 1,000,000 (provided that repayments in an Alternative Currency shall be approximately equal to such amounts), or the amount equal to all Outstandings, or such other amount as necessary to comply with Section 2.1(b). Any prepayment of a Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 4.4.
Repayment of Loans
          (e) . The Borrowers shall, by notice from an Authorized Representative, have the right from time to time, upon not less than three (3) Business Days'
Reductions
 
written notice to the Agent, effective upon receipt, to reduce the Total Commitment, which reduction shall be applied pro rata to the Commitments of the Lenders. The Agent shall give each Lender, within one (1) Business Day of receipt of such notice, telefacsimile notice, or telephonic notice (confirmed in writing), of such reduction. Each such reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of 5,000,000 or such greater amount which is in an integral multiple of 1,000,000, or the entire remaining Total Commitment, and shall permanently reduce the Total Commitment. Each reduction of the Total Commitment shall be accompanied by payment of the Loans to the extent that the principal amount of Outstandings exceeds the Total Commitment after giving effect to such reduction, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amounts prepaid and any amount required under Section 4.4.
     2.2. . (a) All Loans in Alternative Currencies shall be Offshore Rate Loans.
Utilization of Alternative Currencies
          (b) Each request for a Loan in an Alternative Currency under a Borrowing Notice shall constitute the applicable Borrower's request for a Loan of the Euro Equivalent Amount of the amount of the Alternative Currency specified in such Borrowing Notice, and for such Loan to be made available by the Lenders to the applicable Borrower in the Alternative Currency Equivalent Amount of such Euro Equivalent Amount (determined based on the Borrowing Date Exchange Rate applicable to such Loan). The principal amount outstanding on any Loan shall be recorded in the Agent's records in Euros (in the case of a Loan in an Alternative Currency as if the Loan had initially been made in Euros), based on the Euro Equivalent Amount of the initial Loan in an Alternative Currency, as reduced from time to time by the Euro Equivalent Amount (based on the Borrowing Date Exchange Rate applicable to such Loan) of any principal payments with respect to such Loan. Except to the extent provided in the proviso to the definition of the term "Euro Equivalent Amount", for the purposes of determining the maximum amount of Outstandings hereunder, it is intended by the parties that all Loans shall be the functional equivalent of Loans made and repaid (based on the applicable Borrowing Date Exchange Rate for each Loan) in Euros. It is recognized that one or more Lenders may elect to record Loans in Alternative Currencies. The Agent shall maintain records sufficient to identify at any time (A) the Borrowing Date Exchange Rate with respect to each Loan and (B) the portion of the Outstandings attributable to each Loan.
          (c) Any Borrower may elect to Continue an Offshore Rate Loan pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2 and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.2(c). In the event an Offshore Rate Loan is Continued, such election to Continue the Offshore Rate Loan shall be treated as a Loan, and the Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower and the applicable Lenders of the Borrowing Date Exchange Rate, the Interest Period and the rate for such Continued Offshore Rate Loan. The Lenders shall each be deemed to have made a Loan to the applicable Borrower of its Applicable Commitment Percentage of each Loan in an Alternative Currency, and the Agent shall apply the Borrowing Date Exchange Rate for such new Interest Period to such Continued Alternative Currency Equivalent Amount to determine the new Euro Equivalent Amount of such Loan and shall adjust its books and the Outstandings.

The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to any Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article IX; that unless and until the Agent has received any such direction, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full or the Commitments shall not have been terminated, such amount shall be held by the Guarantor in trust for the Agent and the Lenders and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Guarantor, be turned over to the Agent in the exact form received by the Guarantor (duly indorsed by the Guarantor to the Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Agent may determine.

Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this Article XI or any property subject thereto.

When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against the Guarantor the Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against any Borrower, or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrowers, or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any Borrower, or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Agent or any Lender against the Guarantor.
