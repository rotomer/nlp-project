Item 5.02(e). Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On October 16, 2008, the Board of Directors of VF approved an amended and restated form of Change in Control Agreement (the "Agreement") to be entered into with each executive officer of VF. The form of Change in Control Agreement was modified from the form of Change in Control Agreement filed as Exhibit 10(c) to Form 8-K filed on December 17, 2004, to bring the Agreement into compliance with IRS Code Section 409A (principally by eliminating or reducing executives' discretion). The Agreement, which provides substantially the same benefits as those described in VF's 2008 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2008, regarding the previous form of Agreement, includes a number of reductions in benefits for the executives, as well as the addition of acceleration of restricted stock and payment of a pro rata portion of the executive's bonus, both contingent upon a termination of the executive's employment following a change in control of VF, as are all benefits under the Agreement. The form of Change in Control Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

     THIS AGREEMENT made this day of , 2008 (the "") by and between (the "") and VF CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "").

Agreement
                    
Executive
Corporation
                    
     The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "") considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. In this connection, the Corporation recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change in control may exist and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Corporation and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of certain members of the Corporation's management, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances that could arise from the possibility of a change in control of the Corporation.
Board
     In order to induce the Executive to remain in the employ of the Corporation, the Corporation wishes to provide the Executive with certain severance benefits in the event his employment with the Corporation terminates subsequent to a change in control of the Corporation under the circumstances described herein.
     NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
 
     1. . The term of this Agreement commences as of the date and year first above written and shall continue until the second anniversary of the date set forth above. The prior sentence notwithstanding, commencing on the first day after the second anniversary of the date set forth above and on the first day of each subsequent twelve-month period thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year beyond the then existing term. This Agreement shall terminate (except as set forth in the next sentence) if (a) the Corporation gives the Executive notice that it wishes to terminate this Agreement, in which case this Agreement shall terminate as of the date set forth in such notice or (b) the Executive's employment with the Corporation is terminated for any reason, including transfer to a subsidiary company of the Corporation, in which case this Agreement shall terminate on the last day of the Executive's employment with the Corporation; provided, however, that, if the Executive is transferred to a subsidiary company of the Corporation, the Corporation may waive the termination of this Agreement, by a written amendment of this Agreement, executed by both the Corporation and the Executive, which shall refer to this clause and shall be limited to the Executive's transfer to the subsidiary company of the Corporation named in the amendment, unless another amendment is executed upon the Executive's subsequent transfer to another subsidiary company of the Corporation. The Corporation may not give such notice and this Agreement shall not automatically terminate in the event the Executive's employment with the Corporation terminates for any reason, including a transfer to a subsidiary company of the Corporation, (x) at any time while the Corporation has knowledge that any third person has taken steps or announced an intention to take steps reasonably calculated to effect a "Change in Control" (as hereinafter defined) of the Corporation, unless or until such third party has, in the reasonable opinion of the Corporation, abandoned its efforts or intention to effect a Change in Control of the
TERM
 
Corporation or (y) within twenty-four months after the date a Change in Control occurs. It is understood that the Corporation may terminate the Executive's employment at any time, subject to providing, if required to do so in accordance with the terms hereof, the severance benefits hereinafter specified.
     2. . No benefits shall be payable hereunder unless there shall have been a Change in Control of the Corporation and the Executive's employment by the Corporation shall thereafter have been terminated by the Corporation or by the Executive under the circumstances described in paragraph 3(iii) hereof.

If such a declaration shall be properly made, no benefits shall be payable hereunder as a result of such prior but now ineffective Change in Control, but benefits shall remain payable and this Agreement shall remain enforceable as a result of any other Change in Control unless it is similarly declared to be ineffective.

For purposes of this paragraph, no act or failure to act on the Executive's part shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the entire members of the Board, at a meeting of the Board called and held for that purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth above in clauses (A) or (B) of the second sentence of this paragraph and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

For purposes of this Agreement, a "" shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated. In the case of termination by the Executive for Good Reason pursuant to paragraph 3(iii) hereof, the Corporation shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Notice of Termination to remedy the facts and circumstances claimed to provide the basis for termination of the Executive's employment for Good Reason, and the Executive shall not be deemed to have terminated employment for Good Reason unless and until the Corporation fails to remedy such circumstances during the 30 days following its receipt of the Notice of Termination.

Thereafter, his benefits, if any, shall be determined in accordance with whatever disability income insurance plan or plans the Corporation may then have in effect; provided, however, that, if at the time Disability of the Executive is established the disability benefits then available are less advantageous to the Executive than the disability benefits which were available on the date the Change in Control became effective, then his termination of employment shall be deemed to have occurred as a voluntary termination for Good Reason under paragraph 3(iii) hereof and not by reason of Disability, and the provisions of paragraph 4(iii) hereof shall apply in lieu of the provisions of this paragraph 4(i).
          (ii) If the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause, the Corporation shall pay to him his full base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in
 
effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and the Corporation shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement.
          (iii) If the Corporation shall terminate the Executive's employment other than pursuant to paragraph 3(i) or 3(ii) hereof within 24 months after a Change in Control of the Corporation, or if the Executive shall terminate his employment for Good Reason pursuant to paragraph 3(iii) hereof within 24 months after a Change in Control, then:
               (A) The Corporation shall pay to the Executive, not later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination, the Executive's accrued but unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination plus compensation for current and carried-over unused vacation and compensation days in accordance with the Corporation's personnel policy.
               (B) In lieu of any further payments of salary to the Executive after the Date of Termination, the Corporation shall pay to the Executive, not later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination and notwithstanding any dispute between the Executive and the Corporation as to the payment to the Executive of any other amounts under this Agreement or otherwise, a lump sum severance payment (the "") equal to 2.99 times an amount equal to the sum of (1) the greater of the Executive's highest annual base salary in effect at any time within the twelve-month period preceding a Change in Control or the Date of Termination, and (2) the greater of (I) the Target Incentive Award or Target Amount to which the Executive would have been entitled under the Corporation's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "") or Annual Discretionary Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the ""), as applicable, and the base or target amount to which the Executive would have been entitled under any other annual cash bonus program of the Corporation, had he been employed by the Corporation at the end of the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurs,

or (II) the highest amount awarded to the Executive under the EICP or ADMICP and under any other annual cash bonus program of the Corporation during the last three fiscal years prior to the Date of Termination.
               (C) In addition to the foregoing amounts payable under paragraph 4(iii)(A) and (B) above, the Executive will be entitled to the following:
               (1) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination equal to the Target Incentive Award or Target Amount under the EICP or ADMICP, as applicable, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days that have elapsed from the beginning of the fiscal year in which such termination occurs through the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the fiscal year, payable not later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination;
               (2) any stock option rights held by the Executive which were not fully exercisable on the Date of Termination shall immediately become fully exercisable by the Executive and any restricted stock rights held by the Executive which were not fully vested on the Date of Termination shall immediately become fully vested;
               (3) the Corporation shall maintain in full force and effect, for the Executive's continued benefit, until the earlier of (I) 36 months after the Date of Termination or (II) the Executive's 65th birthday, all life, medical and dental insurance programs in which the Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of Termination; provided that his continued participation is possible under the general terms and provisions of such programs; provided, further, that, in the event the Executive's participation in any such program is barred, the Corporation shall arrange to provide the
 
Executive with benefits substantially similar to those which he was entitled to receive under such programs;
               (4) in addition to the benefits to which the Executive is entitled under the Corporation's retirement plans in which he participates or any successor plans or programs in effect on the Date of Termination, the Corporation shall pay to the Executive in one lump sum in cash, an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the retirement pension to which the Executive would have been entitled under the terms of such retirement plan or programs had he accumulated 36 additional months of continuous service after the Date of Termination (or, if less, the number of months between the Date of Termination and the date on which the Executive attains normal retirement age under the plan) at his base salary rate in effect on the Date of Termination reduced by the single sum actuarial equivalent of any amounts to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to the provisions of said retirement plans and programs, discounted to reflect its then present value, paid at the same time as the Severance Payment; provided that, for purposes of this subparagraph (3), the actuarial equivalents shall be determined, and all other calculations shall be made, using the same methods and assumptions utilized under the Corporation's retirement plan or programs; provided, however, that such methods and assumptions shall be no less favorable to the Executive than those in effect on the date of the Change in Control; and
               (5) the Executive shall become fully vested and have a nonforfeitable interest in any benefit which he has accrued under the Corporation's Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (""), including any
SERP
 
Supplemental Annual Benefit Determinations or similar determinations or benefit grants under the SERP adopted at any time prior to termination of the Executive's employment.
          (D) (1) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a ""), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), or similar section, or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to all Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the value of the Payments that would be treated as "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code (the "280G Parachute Value") is greater than the maximum amount that could be paid to the Executive without giving rise to the Excise Tax (the "Parachute Limit"), but does not exceed 105% of the Parachute Limit, then (i) no Gross-Up Payment shall be made and (ii) the Payments shall be reduced such that the 280G Parachute Value that the Executive is entitled to receive shall be one dollar ($1) less than the 280G Parachute Limit, provided that the Payments shall not be so reduced if the Executive elects to be subject to and pay the Excise Tax and so notifies the Company prior to the date the Payments are made. Any reduction in the Payments

Excise Tax
Gross-Up Payment
 
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be first made, pro rata, from any cash Payments. The Corporation's obligation to make the Gross-Up Payment under this subsection (D) shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment.
               (2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (D)(4) hereof, all determinations required to be made under this subsection (D), including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the firm of independent auditors acting as such for the Corporation immediately prior to the Change in Control (the ""); provided, however, that, if the Accounting Firm has performed services for the person, entity or group who caused the Change in Control, or an affiliate thereof, the Executive may select an alternative accounting firm from any nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants, which shall be treated as the Accounting Firm for purposes hereof. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and the Executive within 30 days of termination of employment under this Agreement, if applicable, or such earlier time as is requested by the Executive or the Corporation. When calculating the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay:
Accounting Firm
(I) federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, and
(II) any applicable state and local income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income
 
taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes if paid in such year.
               (3) If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the Corporation shall request the Accounting Firm to furnish the Executive with an opinion that the Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal income tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Corporation should have been made (""), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Corporation exhausts its remedies pursuant to subsection (D) (4) hereof, and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Executive, but in no event shall such payment be made later than the end of the year after the year in which the obligation to pay the Underpayment was incurred.
Underpayment
               (4) The Executive shall notify the Corporation in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Corporation of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive knows of such claim and shall apprise the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of
 
the thirty-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Corporation (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Corporation notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
(I) give the Corporation any information reasonably requested by the Corporation relating to such claim,
(II) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Corporation shall reasonably request in writing from time to time including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Corporation,
(III) cooperate with the Corporation in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
(IV) permit the Corporation to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the Corporation shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate
 
taxing authority on behalf of the Executive or direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Corporation shall determine; provided, however, that if the Corporation directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Corporation shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and the Corporation shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest or penalties, imposed with respect to such payment or advance, as the case may be, or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such payment or advance, as the case may be; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Corporation's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
,
               (5) If after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Corporation pursuant to this subsection the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise Tax to which such Gross-Up Payment relates or with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Corporation's complying with the requirements of subsection (D)(4)) promptly pay to the Corporation the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon by the taxing authority after
 
deducting any taxes applicable thereto). If, after payment by the Corporation of an amount on the Executive's behalf or the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Corporation, as the case may be, pursuant to subsection (D)(4), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Corporation does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty days after such determination, then such advance, if any, shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such payment or such advance, as the case may be, shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid under subsection (D)(4). The forgiveness of such advance shall be considered part of the Gross-Up Payment and subject to gross-up for any taxes (including interest or penalties) associated therewith.
               (6) Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this subsection (D) shall be paid by the Corporation to the Executive within thirty days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination; provided that the Gross-Up Payment shall in all events be paid no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the Excise Tax (and any income or other related taxes or interest or penalties thereon) on a Payment are remitted to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority or, in the case of amounts relating to a claim described in subsection (D) that does not result in the remittance of any federal, state, local and foreign income, excise, social security and other taxes, the calendar year in which the claim is finally settled or otherwise resolved.
