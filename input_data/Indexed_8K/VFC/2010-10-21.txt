Our Global Jeanswear business also achieved both top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Global Jeanswear revenues grew 1% in the quarter, or 2% on a constant currency basis. The exit of our European mass market business impacted the revenue comparisons by 2%. Domestic revenues rose 5% with growth in all three major businesses: Mass Market revenues grew 7% in the quarter, and revenues in our Lee and Western businesses rose 1% and 5%, respectively. International jeans revenues decreased 7%, with 2 percentage points of the decline due to foreign currency translation and the rest due primarily to the exit of our mass business in Europe. Jeanswear revenues in Asia increased 44%, with growth also achieved in Mexico, Latin America and Canada.
Jeanswear:
Operating income increased 6%, with operating margins rising by nearly one full percentage point to 17.6% in the quarter reflecting improved profitability in our international jeans businesses.
Our Imagewear business delivered excellent results in the quarter, with a 10% increase in revenues and a 68% increase in operating income. The Licensed Sports and Image Apparel businesses both generated solid growth for the second consecutive quarter. Growth in the Image business resulted from improved business conditions and increased market share with our key industrial customers. Images flame-resistant apparel business performed particularly well in the quarter. The Licensed Sports apparel business is also gaining market share, helped by our quick response retail replenishment capabilities during the Major League Baseball divisional playoff races and strong retail response to new women's programs.
Imagewear:
As anticipated, a shift in the timing of shipments for special programs from the third quarter to the fourth resulted in a decline in Sportswear revenues of 13%. Sales of mens sportswear at our major wholesale partners are running up over 20% season to date versus last year. This trend, along with higher shipments resulting from the aforementioned shift in timing, should drive a mid-teen increase in brand revenues in the fourth quarter. brand revenues in the U.S. increased 42% in the quarter, reflecting the successful launch earlier this year of a new program that is exclusive with Macys.

Gross Margins Reach Record Third Quarter Level
Continuing the trend of the last several quarters, gross margins were substantially above prior year levels. Third quarter gross margins reached a record level for the period, rising over 200 basis points to 46.5%. This substantial improvement was driven by three primary factors: 1) lower product costs; 2) continued expansion and improved gross margins in our retail stores; and 3) generally clean inventories across our businesses. Operating margins rose to 15.9% in the current quarter from 15.2% in last years period.
Expansion in International and Direct-to-Consumer Businesses
Our international and direct-to-consumer businesses remain important long-term drivers of both organic growth and margin expansion.

Strong Balance Sheet
Cash and equivalents were $403 million at the end of the quarter. Reflecting strengthening revenue trends, inventories rose by 3% from prior year levels. We continue to expect a very strong year of cash flow generation, which is expected to approximate $850 million. Year-to-date we have spent $322 million to repurchase 4 million shares. During the quarter we paid down $200 million of long-term debt that carried an interest rate of 8.5%.
Outlook: Raising 2010 Guidance and Expecting Strong Results in 2011
We expect continued strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Gross margins should be comparable to the record level achieved in the 2009 period. We are continuing to invest in building our brands globally to fuel strong organic growth next year and beyond. As noted above, $45 million in incremental brand investment spending is planned in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we now expect 2010 revenues to increase by more than 5% to approximately $7.6 billion, versus our prior guidance of an increase of 4 to 5%.
We are also raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.25 to $6.30 per share, versus our previous guidance of $6.10 per share. The new guidance represents an increase of over 20% from 2009 earnings per share of $5.16 (before impairment charges). On a GAAP basis, earnings per share are now expected to increase over 50% from the $4.13 reported in 2009.
We look forward to wrapping up a very strong 2010, with revenues near record levels and all-time highs in gross margins and earnings, concluded Mr. Wiseman. Looking ahead, we are confident that the investments made this year will drive another year of solid top and bottom line growth in 2011.
Dividend Increased
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.63 per share, an increase of $.03 per share. The dividend is payable on December 20, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 10, 2010. This marks the 38 consecutive year of higher dividend payments to shareholders.
