Expansion in International Revenues
Our international businesses remain an important long-term driver of both organic growth and margin expansion. During the quarter, international revenues increased 22% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in our European Outdoor & Action Sports businesses, and across our biggest brands in Asia. Total revenues in Asia were up 31% in the quarter, with our jeanswear, and businesses each growing in excess of 40% in the quarter.

Cash Flow from Operations Rises to a Record $1 Billion
Cash flow from operations reached an all-time high of $1 billion in 2010. Cash rose to $792 million at the end of the year. Inventories rose 12%, as expected, to support strengthening revenue trends. During 2010 we spent $412 million to repurchase 5.1 million shares, made $264 million in dividend payments, paid down $200 million of long-term debt, and contributed $100 million to our pension plan.
2011 Guidance: Strong Top and Bottom Line Growth and Stable Operating Margins
We enter 2011 with excellent top and bottom line momentum, and our brands very well-positioned to grow and capture additional market share, said Mr. Wiseman. 2011 should mark the highest rate of organic revenue growth since 2007. The investments made last year to drive organic growth were successful and will continue this year, further strengthening our foundation for delivering solid, sustainable growth in 2011 and beyond.
Revenues in 2011 are expected to increase by 8 to 9%, and we anticipate earnings per share rising to $7.00 to $7.10 this year.
Operating margins are expected to be comparable to the 13.3% achieved in 2010. Reflecting higher product costs, gross margins are expected to decline, but by less than one percentage point, as margins will also continue to benefit from our changing business mix. We will continue to invest strongly in our brands, with the ratio of marketing spending to revenues remaining at approximately the same level in 2011 as in 2010. However, our overall SG&A spending will represent a lower percentage of revenues in 2011, reflecting the leverage from strong revenue growth.
Key points related to our 2011 outlook include:
Our Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary coalitions are each planning for mid-single digit revenue growth in 2011.
Solid revenue growth across all coalitions, highlighted by mid-teen percentage growth in Outdoor & Action Sports and supported by continued healthy levels of marketing spending.
with low double-digit growth expected in both Europe and the Americas, and exceptionally strong growth in Asia. Growing our business in Asia  particularly in China and India  remains a strategic priority, with revenue growth expected to exceed 25% this year. On a longer term basis, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 40% of total revenues from international markets.
15% growth in international revenues,
Growth will be driven by approximately 100 store openings in 2011  the highest number of store openings in our history  and low single-digit comp store growth, in addition to the continued rapid growth in our e-commerce business. Over half our new store openings will be outside the U.S., further supporting our international growth plans. We expect that our direct-to-consumer revenues will approach 20% of total revenues in 2011.
10 to 15% revenue growth in our direct-to-consumer business.
Dividend Declared
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.63 per share, payable on March 21, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 11, 2011.
