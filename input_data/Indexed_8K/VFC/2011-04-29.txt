2011 Guidance Increased
VFs formula for success continues to produce outstanding results, said Mr. Wiseman. That formula includes the combination of powerful brands supported by targeted investments to drive profitable growth, rapidly expanding international and direct to consumer platforms, and new tools and processes designed to spur even greater innovation across VF.
Revenues are now expected to rise approximately 10% in 2011, up from previous guidance for an increase of 8 to 9%, due largely to the impact of a weaker dollar in translating foreign currencies, as well as broad-based strength across our businesses.
Earnings per share are now anticipated to increase to $7.25, up from our previous guidance of $7.00 to $7.10 per share. The new guidance includes the $.11 in special items reported in the first quarter, as well as an increase of $.10 per share from foreign currency translation.
We continue to look forward to another strong year of cash flow from operations, which should again reach $1 billion in 2011.
Dividend Declared
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.63 per share, payable on June 20, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 10, 2011.
