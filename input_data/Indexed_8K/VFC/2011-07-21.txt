We are bullish on the outlook for our brands as we enter the second half of 2011, and are raising our full year revenue and earnings guidance accordingly, said Mr. Wiseman.

Revenues are now expected to rise 12 to 13% in 2011, up from previous guidance of approximately 10%, reflecting broad-based strength across all our businesses.
