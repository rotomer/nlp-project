     The net proceeds received by the Company, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $892 million.

The Notes are the unsecured obligations of V.F. Corporation and rank equally with all of its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
     The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2007, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2007, between the Company and the Trustee, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 24, 2011, between the Company and the Trustee (as so amended, the "Indenture"). The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate, reset quarterly, equal to the three-month LIBOR rate for U.S. dollars plus 0.750% (75 basis points) per year and the Fixed Rate Notes will bear interest at the rate of 3.500% per year. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly on each February 23, May 23, August 23 and November 23, commencing November 23, 2011. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, of each year, commencing March 1, 2012. The Floating Rate Notes will mature on August 23, 2013, and the Fixed Rate Notes will mature on September 1, 2021.
     The forgoing description of the issuance, sale and terms of the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture entered into in connection therewith. The Underwriting Agreement and the Second Supplemental Indenture are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1 and 4.2 and the Indenture is incorporated herein by reference.

     (f) The Company shall have requested and caused PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and that they have performed a review of the unaudited interim financial information of the Company for the six-month period ended July 2, 2011, and as at July 2, 2011, in accordance with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("") AU 722, and stating in effect that:
PCAOB
     (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules and any pro forma financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
     (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under PCAOB AU 722, of the unaudited interim financial information for the six-month period ended July 2, 2011 and as at July 2, 2011; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, Board of Directors and the Audit, Compensation, Finance and Nominating and Governance Committees of the Board of Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to January 1, 2011, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
     (1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; or
 
     (2) with respect to the period subsequent to July 2, 2011, there were any increases, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any changes in the capital stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the July 2, 2011 consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from July 3, 2011 to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year in net revenues or in total or per share amounts of net income attributable to the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Capitalization," and "Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 6 and 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
     References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i)
 
or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
     (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
          The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Shearman & Sterling LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, on the Closing Date.
          7. .

Morgan Securities LLC on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
          8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
Indemnification and Contribution
 
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity; , that the Company acknowledges that the only such information provided by any Underwriter consists of the statements set forth (i) in the first paragraph under the caption "Underwriting  Commissions and Discounts" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, concerning the terms of the offering by the Underwriters, and (ii) under the caption "UnderwritingShort Positions" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, concerning possible stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and overall allotment activities by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities (with respect to themselves only). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
provided
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the
 
indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any findings of fact or admissions of fault or culpability as to the indemnified party.
provided
however
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
Losses
provided
however
 
material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
          9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

          10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or there shall have occurred any material disruption in commercial banking, securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iii) there shall have occurred any
Termination
 
outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
          11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
c/o Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
One Bryant Park New York, New York 10036
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special counsel for V.F. Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated August 17, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule II thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.500% Notes due 2021 (together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of October 15, 2007 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 24, 2011 (together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee.
     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
     We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-175700) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2011 relating to the Securities (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), the pricing term sheet dated August 17, 2011 relating to the Securities (together with the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the "Disclosure Package") and the prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2011 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement became effective under the Act and the Indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on July 21, 2011 pursuant to Rule 462(e). The registration statement at
 
the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated July 21, 2011 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
     We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
     Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
     1. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that we express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law, (y) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above and (z) validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Securities to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest.
     2. The Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Securities are to be issued, provided that we express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law, (y) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above and (z) validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Securities to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest.
     3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
     4. The Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") by and among the Company, VF Enterprises, Inc. and The Timberland Company has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     5. The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     6. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Indenture, the Securities, the Merger Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") will not contravene (i) any provision of the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Documents, provided that we express no opinion as to federal or state securities laws, (ii) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or (iii) any agreement that is specified in Annex A hereto.
     7. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency under the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Documents is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Documents, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which we express no opinion.
     8. We have considered the statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Securities. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects. The statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, in our opinion fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
     In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (1) through (4) above, we have assumed that each party to the Documents has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other
 
instrument binding upon such party, provided that we make no such assumption to the extent that we have specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company, and (ii) each Document (other than the Underwriting Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
     We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America, except that we express no opinion as to any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate. Insofar as the foregoing opinion involves matters governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we have relied, without independent investigation, on the opinion of Candace S. Cummings, Vice President  Administration, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, delivered to you today pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
     This opinion is rendered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Securities from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.
 
1. Credit Agreement dated October 15, 2007, by and among V.F. Corporation, as Borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and a Lender, and the other parties thereto
2. International Credit Agreement dated October 26, 2007, by and among VF Investments S.a.r.l., VF Europe BVBA, and VF International S.a.g.l., as Borrowers; VF Corporation, as Guarantor, and the Lenders party thereto

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special counsel for V.F. Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated August 17, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule II thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.500% Notes due 2021 (together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of October 15, 2007 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 24, 2011 (together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").
     We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-175700) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2011 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Securities, the pricing term sheet dated August 17, 2011 set forth in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement for the Securities (the "Pricing Term Sheet") and the prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2011 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated July 21, 2011 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the Pricing Term Sheet, are hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosure Package." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
 
     We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
     The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or quantitative information. Furthermore, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes," "Description of Debt Securities" and "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
     On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
     (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
     (ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities:
     (a) on the date of the Underwriting Agreement or at the time the Registration Statement became effective, the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
     (b) at 3:30 P.M. New York City time on August 17, 2011, the Disclosure Package contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
     (c) the Prospectus as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement or as of the date hereof contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding, the financial statements or financial schedules or
 
other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1. In addition, we express no view as to the conveyance of the Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
     This letter is delivered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Securities from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
As Representatives of the Several Underwriters
c/o Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
One Bryant Park New York, New York 10036
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     I have acted as counsel to V.F. Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issue and sale to you as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement, dated August 17, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.500% Notes due 2021 (together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes"), to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2007 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 24, 2011 (together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Capitalized terms used herein unless otherwise defined shall have the meanings specified in the Underwriting Agreement.
     I have examined (a) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company; (b) the By-laws of the Company; (c) the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-175700) filed with Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and units to be issued from time to time by the Company (such registration statement in the form in which it became effective under the Act, including all material incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"); (d) the prospectus dated July 21, 2011, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2011, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (such prospectus, including all material incorporated by reference therein, and such prospectus supplement being hereinafter called the "Prospectus"); (e) the documents constituting the Disclosure Package; (f) the Underwriting Agreement; (g) the Indenture; (h) the Merger Agreement; (i) the form of Notes approved by an officer of the
 
Company duly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company to approve the terms of such Notes; (j) certain resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company at a meeting held on July 19, 2011; and (k) such other documents and instruments as I have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion. I am also familiar with the proceedings by which such instruments and the transactions contemplated thereby were authorized by the Company.
     I am a member of the Bar of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and I do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the federal laws of the United States and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
     Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, it is my opinion that as of the date hereof:
     (i) Each of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Merger Agreement and the Notes has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (ii) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly subsisting and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its businesses or the ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
     (iii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and are fully paid and non-assessable;
     (iv) Each material domestic subsidiary and limited partnership of the Company listed on Schedule V of the Underwriting Agreement has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, is in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; all of the issued shares of capital stock, partnership interests or limited liability company interests, as the case may be, of each material domestic subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable (where applicable), and (except for directors' qualifying shares and except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, to the best of my knowledge after reasonable investigation, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
     (v) To the best of my knowledge after reasonable investigation and other than as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject, which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries,

In Witness
Dated: August 24, 2011
     This is one of the Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 24, 2011 (herein called the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee under the Indenture (the "Trustee"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000. The Company may at any time issue additional notes under the Indenture in unlimited amounts having the same terms as the Notes.
     The Notes of this series are subject to redemption, as a whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to each Noteholder of Notes to be redeemed at his address as it appears in the Securities Register, (1) on any date prior to June 1, 2021 (three months prior to their Stated Maturity) at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date or (ii) as determined by a Quotation Agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued and paid as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 20 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date, and (2) on any date on and after June 1, 2021 at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Securities to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date; provided that unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on or after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity will be computed as of the third business day immediately preceding the Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized in accordance with customary financial practice in pricing new issues of corporate notes of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the average of the Reference Treasury
 
Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, , that if three or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations are obtained, the highest and lowest of such quotations shall be excluded from the calculation. "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealers" means (i) each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and their respective successors; , that, if the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
provided
provided, however
     The Notes do not have the benefit of any sinking fund obligations.
     In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Noteholder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     In the event that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not occurred on or before March 12, 2012 (the "Outside Date") (such occurrence, the "Special Mandatory Redemption Event"), the Company shall redeem the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes on or before the Outside Date, on the date that is 20 Business Days after the Outside Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Date"), at a cash redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price"); , that if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to March 12, 2012, the Outside Date shall be deemed to be the date the Merger Agreement is terminated.
provided, however
     On the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the Company shall promptly mail a notice to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee. Such notice of redemption shall state: (a) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, (b) the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, (c) that, on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Special Mandatory Redemption Price will become due and payable upon the Notes and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, and (d) the place or places where the Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Notice of redemption of the Notes shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. For purposes of Section 11.05 and 11.06 of the Base Indenture, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date shall be a "Redemption Date" and the Special Mandatory Redemption Price shall be a "Redemption Price."
     If a Change of Control Repurchase Event with respect to the Notes occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes, the Company shall make an offer to each Noteholder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral
 
multiples of $1,000) of that Noteholder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any such Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of an impending Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice (a "Change of Control Notice") to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such Change of Control Notice is mailed. The Change of Control Notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to repurchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice.
     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
     On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, with respect to the Notes:
      accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes (in integral multiples of $1,000) properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer ("Tendered Notes");
 - 
      deposit with the Trustee a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all Tendered Notes; and
 - 
      deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Tendered Notes, together with an officers' certificate stating that such Tendered Notes have been properly accepted by the Company and stating the aggregate principal amount of Tendered Notes being purchased by the Company.
 - 
     The Trustee or Paying Agent, as applicable, shall promptly mail to each Noteholder of Tendered Notes the repurchase price for the Tendered Notes, and the Trustee shall, to the extent necessary, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each such Noteholder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Tendered Notes; provided, that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer
 
made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Note, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders of the Notes of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Noteholders of not less than 50% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Noteholders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Noteholders of all Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Noteholder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Noteholder and upon all future Noteholders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Noteholder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Noteholder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, the Noteholders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Noteholders of a majority in principal amount of Notes of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Noteholder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Noteholder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Notes of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Noteholder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made to a Noteholder for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

     V.F. CORPORATION, a corporation duly incorporated and subsisting under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of $400,000,000 on August 23, 2013 and to pay interest thereon from August 24, 2011, or from the most recent Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly on February 23, May 23, August 23 and November 23 in each year, commencing November 23, 2011, at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the provisions set forth on the reverse hereof, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.

In Witness
Dated: August 24, 2011
     This is one of the Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 24, 2011 (herein called the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee under the Indenture (the "Trustee"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $400,000,000. The Company may at any time issue additional notes under the Indenture in unlimited amounts having the same terms as the Notes.
     The Notes are not subject to redemption other than as set forth below.
     The Notes do not have the benefit of any sinking fund obligations.
          Interest payable on any Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date or the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date shall be the amount accrued from, and including, the immediately preceding Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and including the original issue date of August 24, 2011, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for with respect to the Notes) to but excluding such Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date or Floating Rate Note Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, a "Floating Rate Note Interest Period"). The Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate, as determined on the applicable Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date by the Calculation Agent, plus 0.75% (75 basis points) from the original issue date thereof to the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date. The amount of interest for each day that the Notes are outstanding (the "Daily Interest Amount") shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent by dividing the interest rate in effect during the applicable Floating Rate Note Interest Period by 360 and multiplying the result by the outstanding principal amount of the Notes. The amount of interest to be paid on the Notes for any Floating Rate Note Interest Period will be calculated by adding the Daily Interest Amounts for each day in such Floating Rate Note Interest Period. Interest on the Notes shall be payable quarterly in arrears on February 23, May 23, August 23 and November 23 of each year, beginning on November 23, 2011 (each such date, a "Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date"). If any Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date, other than the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date, is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day; provided, that if the next succeeding day that is a Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the interest payment due on such Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date is not a Business Day, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be paid
 
on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date or any day thereafter. Each payment of interest on the Notes will include interest to, but excluding, as the case may be, the relevant Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date or Floating Rate Note Maturity Date. The rate of interest on the Notes for the Initial Floating Rate Note Interest Period will be 1.05844% and will be reset on the next occurring Floating Rate Note Interest Reset Date.
     "Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date" means the second London Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Floating Rate Note Interest Reset Date. The Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date for the Initial Floating Rate Interest Period will be August 22, 2011. "Floating Rate Note Interest Reset Date" means the first day of each Floating Rate Note Interest Period other than the Initial Floating Rate Note Interest Period. The "Initial Floating Rate Note Interest Period" shall be August 24, 2011 through November 22, 2011. "London Business Day" means a day on which commercial banks are open for business (transacting dealings in U.S. dollars) in London. The "three-month LIBOR," for any Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date will be the offered rate for deposits in the London interbank market in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, as such rate appears on the Reuters (or any successor service) Page LIBOR 01 (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or any successor service, for the purpose of displaying such rates) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date. The "Calculation Agent" shall be the agent appointed by the Company to calculate the interest rate on the Notes and will initially be the Trustee. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing. On or before each Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the interest rate and notify the Paying Agent. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent shall in the absence of manifest error be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Noteholders of the Notes. For so long as three-month LIBOR is required to be determined with respect to the Notes, the Company shall have a Calculation Agent. In the event that the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to act, the Calculation Agent fails to duly establish three-month LIBOR for any Interest Period or the Company proposes to remove the Calculation Agent, the Company shall appoint itself or another person that is a bank, trust company, investment banking firm or other financial institution to act as the Calculation Agent.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York or other applicable state law, as such law may be modified by United States law of general application.
     In the event that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not occurred on or before March 12, 2012 (the "Outside Date") (such occurrence, the "Special Mandatory Redemption Event"), the Company shall redeem the Notes on the date that is 20 Business Days after the Outside Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Date"), at a cash redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price"); , that if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to March 12, 2012, the Outside Date shall be deemed to be the date the Merger Agreement is terminated.
provided, however
 
     On the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the Company shall promptly mail a notice to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee. Such notice of redemption shall state: (a) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, (b) the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, (c) that, on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Special Mandatory Redemption Price will become due and payable upon the Notes and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, and (d) the place or places where the Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Notice of redemption of the Notes shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. For purposes of Section 11.05 and 11.06 of the Base Indenture, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date shall be a "Redemption Date" and the Special Mandatory Redemption Price shall be a "Redemption Price."
     If a Change of Control Repurchase Event with respect to the Notes occurs, the Company shall make an offer to each Noteholder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Noteholder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any such Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of an impending Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice (a "Change of Control Notice") to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such Change of Control Notice is mailed. The Change of Control Notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to repurchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice.
     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
     On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, with respect to the Notes:
      accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes (in integral multiples of $1,000) properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer ("Tendered Notes");
 - 
      deposit with the Trustee a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all Tendered Notes; and
 - 
 
      deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Tendered Notes, together with an officers' certificate stating that such Tendered Notes have been properly accepted by the Company and stating the aggregate principal amount of Tendered Notes being purchased by the Company.
 - 
     The Trustee or Paying Agent, as applicable, shall promptly mail to each Noteholder of Tendered Notes the repurchase price for the Tendered Notes, and the Trustee shall, to the extent necessary, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each such Noteholder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Tendered Notes; provided, that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Note, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders of the Notes of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Noteholders of not less than 50% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Noteholders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Noteholders of all Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Noteholder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Noteholder and upon all future Noteholders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Noteholder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Noteholder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, the Noteholders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in
 
respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Noteholders of a majority in principal amount of Notes of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Noteholder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Noteholder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Notes of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Noteholder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made to a Noteholder for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Exhibit 4.3

THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE.
     UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION ("DTC"), TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OR TRANSFER, EXCHANGE, OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO.

     V.F. CORPORATION, a corporation duly incorporated and subsisting under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of $400,000,000 on August 23, 2013 and to pay interest thereon from August 24, 2011, or from the most recent Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly on February 23, May 23, August 23 and November 23 in each year, commencing November 23, 2011, at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the provisions set forth on the reverse hereof, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.

In Witness
Dated: August 24, 2011
     This is one of the Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 24, 2011 (herein called the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee under the Indenture (the "Trustee"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $400,000,000. The Company may at any time issue additional notes under the Indenture in unlimited amounts having the same terms as the Notes.
     The Notes are not subject to redemption other than as set forth below.
     The Notes do not have the benefit of any sinking fund obligations.
     Interest payable on any Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date or the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date shall be the amount accrued from, and including, the immediately preceding Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and including the original issue date of August 24, 2011, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for with respect to the Notes) to but excluding such Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date or Floating Rate Note Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, a "Floating Rate Note Interest Period"). The Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate, as determined on the applicable Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date by the Calculation Agent, plus 0.75% (75 basis points) from the original issue date thereof to the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date. The amount of interest for each day that the Notes are outstanding (the "Daily Interest Amount") shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent by dividing the interest rate in effect during the applicable Floating Rate Note Interest Period by 360 and multiplying the result by the outstanding principal amount of the Notes. The amount of interest to be paid on the Notes for any Floating Rate Note Interest Period will be calculated by adding the Daily Interest Amounts for each day in such Floating Rate Note Interest Period. Interest on the Notes shall be payable quarterly in arrears on February 23, May 23, August 23 and November 23 of each year, beginning on November 23, 2011 (each such date, a "Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date"). If any Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date, other than the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date, is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day; provided, that if the next succeeding day that is a Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the interest payment due on such Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date is not a Business Day, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be paid on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the Floating Rate Note Maturity Date or any day thereafter. Each payment of interest on the
 
Notes will include interest to, but excluding, as the case may be, the relevant Floating Rate Note Interest Payment Date or Floating Rate Note Maturity Date. The rate of interest on the Notes for the Initial Floating Rate Note Interest Period will be 1.05844% and will be reset on the next occurring Floating Rate Note Interest Reset Date.
     "Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date" means the second London Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Floating Rate Note Interest Reset Date. The Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date for the Initial Floating Rate Interest Period will be August 22, 2011. "Floating Rate Note Interest Reset Date" means the first day of each Floating Rate Note Interest Period other than the Initial Floating Rate Note Interest Period. The "Initial Floating Rate Note Interest Period" shall be August 24, 2011 through November 22, 2011. "London Business Day" means a day on which commercial banks are open for business (transacting dealings in U.S. dollars) in London. The "three-month LIBOR," for any Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date will be the offered rate for deposits in the London interbank market in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, as such rate appears on the Reuters (or any successor service) Page LIBOR 01 (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or any successor service, for the purpose of displaying such rates) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date. The "Calculation Agent" shall be the agent appointed by the Company to calculate the interest rate on the Notes and will initially be the Trustee. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate in accordance with the foregoing. On or before each Floating Rate Note Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the interest rate and notify the Paying Agent. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent shall in the absence of manifest error be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Noteholders of the Notes. For so long as three-month LIBOR is required to be determined with respect to the Notes, the Company shall have a Calculation Agent. In the event that the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to act, the Calculation Agent fails to duly establish three-month LIBOR for any Interest Period or the Company proposes to remove the Calculation Agent, the Company shall appoint itself or another person that is a bank, trust company, investment banking firm or other financial institution to act as the Calculation Agent.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York or other applicable state law, as such law may be modified by United States law of general application.
          In the event that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not occurred on or before March 12, 2012 (the "Outside Date") (such occurrence, the "Special Mandatory Redemption Event"), the Company shall redeem the Notes on the date that is 20 Business Days after the Outside Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Date"), at a cash redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price"); , that if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to March 12, 2012, the Outside Date shall be deemed to be the date the Merger Agreement is terminated.
provided, however
          On the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the Company shall promptly mail a notice to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee. Such notice of redemption shall state: (a) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, (b)
 
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, (c) that, on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Special Mandatory Redemption Price will become due and payable upon the Notes and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, and (d) the place or places where the Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Notice of redemption of the Notes shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. For purposes of Section 11.05 and 11.06 of the Base Indenture, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date shall be a "Redemption Date" and the Special Mandatory Redemption Price shall be a "Redemption Price."
     If a Change of Control Repurchase Event with respect to the Notes occurs, the Company shall make an offer to each Noteholder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Noteholder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any such Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of an impending Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice (a "Change of Control Notice") to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such Change of Control Notice is mailed. The Change of Control Notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to repurchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice.
     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
     On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, with respect to the Notes:
      accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes (in integral multiples of $1,000) properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer ("Tendered Notes");
 - 
      deposit with the Trustee a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all Tendered Notes; and
 - 
      deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Tendered Notes, together with an officers' certificate stating that such Tendered Notes have been properly accepted by the Company and stating the aggregate principal amount of Tendered Notes being purchased by the Company.
 - 
 
     The Trustee or Paying Agent, as applicable, shall promptly mail to each Noteholder of Tendered Notes the repurchase price for the Tendered Notes, and the Trustee shall, to the extent necessary, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each such Noteholder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Tendered Notes; provided, that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Note, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Noteholders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Noteholders of all Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Noteholder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Noteholder and upon all future Noteholders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Noteholder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Noteholder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, the Noteholders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Noteholders of a majority in principal amount of Notes of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Noteholder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal
 
hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Noteholder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Noteholder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made to a Noteholder for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

In Witness
Dated: August 24, 2011
     This is one of the Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 24, 2011 (herein called the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee under the Indenture (the "Trustee"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000. The Company may at any time issue additional notes under the Indenture in unlimited amounts having the same terms as the Notes.
     The Notes of this series are subject to redemption, as a whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to each Noteholder of Notes to be redeemed at his address as it appears in the Securities Register, (1) on any date prior to June 1, 2021 (three months prior to their Stated Maturity) at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date or (ii) as determined by a Quotation Agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued and paid as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 20 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date, and (2) on any date on and after June 1, 2021 at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Securities to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date; provided that unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on or after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity will be computed as of the third business day immediately preceding the Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized in accordance with customary financial practice in pricing new issues of corporate notes of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, , that if three or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations are obtained, the highest and lowest of such quotations shall
provided
 
be excluded from the calculation. "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealers" means (i) each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and their respective successors; , that, if the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
provided, however
     The Notes do not have the benefit of any sinking fund obligations.
     In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Noteholder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     In the event that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not occurred on or before March 12, 2012 (the "Outside Date") (such occurrence, the "Special Mandatory Redemption Event"), the Company shall redeem the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes on or before the Outside Date, on the date that is 20 Business Days after the Outside Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Date"), at a cash redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price"); , that if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to March 12, 2012, the Outside Date shall be deemed to be the date the Merger Agreement is terminated.
provided, however
     On the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the Company shall promptly mail a notice to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee. Such notice of redemption shall state: (a) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, (b) the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, (c) that, on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Special Mandatory Redemption Price will become due and payable upon the Notes and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, and (d) the place or places where the Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Notice of redemption of the Notes shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. For purposes of Section 11.05 and 11.06 of the Base Indenture, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date shall be a "Redemption Date" and the Special Mandatory Redemption Price shall be a "Redemption Price."
     If a Change of Control Repurchase Event with respect to the Notes occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes, the Company shall make an offer to each Noteholder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Noteholder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any such Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option,
 
prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of an impending Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice (a "Change of Control Notice") to each Noteholder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such Change of Control Notice is mailed. The Change of Control Notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to repurchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the Change of Control Notice.
     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
     On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, with respect to the Notes:
      accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes (in integral multiples of $1,000) properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer ("Tendered Notes");
 - 
      deposit with the Trustee a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all Tendered Notes; and
 - 
      deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Tendered Notes, together with an officers' certificate stating that such Tendered Notes have been properly accepted by the Company and stating the aggregate principal amount of Tendered Notes being purchased by the Company.
 - 
     The Trustee or Paying Agent, as applicable, shall promptly mail to each Noteholder of Tendered Notes the repurchase price for the Tendered Notes, and the Trustee shall, to the extent necessary, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each such Noteholder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Tendered Notes; provided, that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Note, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
     If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders of the Notes of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Noteholders of not less than 50% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Noteholders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Noteholders of all Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Noteholder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Noteholder and upon all future Noteholders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Noteholder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Noteholder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, the Noteholders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Noteholders of a majority in principal amount of Notes of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Noteholder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Noteholder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
     The Notes of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Noteholder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made to a Noteholder for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
