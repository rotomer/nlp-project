Strong Balance Sheet
VFs financial position remains strong. Cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter were $337 million compared with $403 million in the 2010 period. The increase in long-term debt reflects the financing of the Timberland acquisition. Short-term borrowings rose in conjunction with the acquisition, as well as to meet working capital needs, with most of these borrowings expected to be repaid by year-end. Inventories excluding Timberland rose 19%, with 9% of the increase due to higher product costs, 1% due to foreign currency translation, and the remaining increase reflecting increased unit volumes to support strong revenue growth expectations for the fourth quarter.
2011 Guidance Increased
Were confident that our brands momentum will continue through the fourth quarter, and look forward to delivering a year of stellar organic growth to our shareholders, capped by the highly accretive and transformational Timberland acquisition, Wiseman said. We will, of course, continue to carefully monitor economic and market conditions globally, and are well-positioned to respond quickly, if conditions change materially, to protect our brands and ensure our business remains strong and healthy.
Total revenues are now expected to rise 22 to 23% in 2011, due to continued strong organic growth and the Timberland acquisition. Organic revenue growth is anticipated at approximately 13.5% in 2011, above previous guidance for growth of 12 to 13%. The full year revenue contribution from Timberland continues to be about $700 million in 2011.
Reflecting the Timberland acquisition, and the fact that more than half of Timberlands revenues on an annual basis are from international markets, international revenues are now expected to grow by approximately 40% this year. In 2011, international revenues should account for 34% of total revenues, up from 30% in 2010. Direct-to-consumer revenues are now anticipated to increase by nearly 30%. In 2011 direct-to-consumer should account for 19% of total revenues.
Adjusted earnings are now anticipated to increase to approximately $8.15 per share, up from prior guidance for earnings of approximately $7.50 per share. For the first time, our guidance includes Timberland. The $8.15 per share includes accretion from Timberland of $.55 per share, excluding acquisition-related expenses, (up from $.45 per share accretion indicated at the time of acquisition), as well as an increase of $.10 per share from stronger-than-anticipated organic earnings growth. Acquisition-related expenses are expected to approximate $.25 per share in 2011, up slightly from the $.20 per share indicated at the time of acquisition.)
Adjusted Amounts  Excluding Timberland acquisitionrelated expenses
The discussions in this release refer to adjusted amounts which exclude transaction and restructuring costs related to the acquisition of Timberland, which approximated $3.5 million and $26.6 million during the second and third quarters of 2011, respectively, and are estimated at $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, and the estimated tax benefits of these costs. On a per share basis, the acquisition-related expenses were $.02 and $.18 in the second and third quarters of 2011, respectively, and are estimated at $.05 for the fourth quarter of 2011. Please see reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted amounts later in this release.
Timberland Acquisition Accounting

Adjustments may be made to the acquired assets and liabilities as new information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
