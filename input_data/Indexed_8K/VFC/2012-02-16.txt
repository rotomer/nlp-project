2012 Guidance: Strong Top and Bottom Line Growth
In 2012, our Outdoor & Action Sports business should exceed 50% of total revenues  a new milestone for VF, achieved by a combination of consistent, outstanding organic growth and a track record of successful acquisitions, said Wiseman. A big focus for us this year will be on building the foundation to support Timberlands future growth and to strengthen its profitability. We look forward to a year of healthy growth across our coalitions and to delivering another year of record revenues and earnings to our shareholders.
2012 revenues should increase by approximately 15% (17% in constant dollars), with Timberland accounting for about $1 billion of the growth. Excluding Timberland, revenues should rise by approximately 6% (8% in constant dollars).
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to rise to approximately $9.30. Included in this guidance is the anticipated negative impact from 1) foreign currency translation, which is expected to reduce earnings by $0.41 per share, and 2) higher pension expense, which will negatively impact earnings by $0.19 per share. Timberland should earn approximately $1.10 per share in 2012 (excluding acquisition-related expenses estimated at $0.20 per share). On a GAAP basis, earnings per share are expected to increase to approximately $9.10.
Gross margin in 2012 should expand by approximately 70 basis points over the 45.8% reported in 2011, as the headwinds posed by higher product costs subside, with all of the improvement occurring in the second half of the year. Operating margin should expand by approximately 20 basis points, which is net of a 30 basis point negative impact from higher pension expense. Timberlands operating margin should exceed 11% in 2012. Excluding Timberland in both 2011 and 2012, the operating margin in 2012 is expected to improve 40 basis points from 13.6% to 14.0%, including a 40 basis point negative impact from higher pension expense.
Key points related to our 2012 outlook include:
including a full year of revenues from Timberland. On an organic basis, Outdoor & Action Sports revenues are expected to rise at a low-teen percentage rate in constant dollars. and brands look forward to another year of strong growth, with both brands anticipating mid-teen revenue growth in constant dollars. Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands are each planning for mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2012.
