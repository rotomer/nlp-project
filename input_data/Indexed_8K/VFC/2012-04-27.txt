Balance Sheet Strength
Inventories remain very well managed, up 28% in total from March 2011 levels but up only 7% excluding Timberland, with the majority of the increase resulting from higher product costs. The higher debt levels compared with 2011 are related to the Timberland acquisition. Two million shares were repurchased near the end of the first quarter for approximately $300 million.
2012 Earnings Guidance Raised
Based on strong first quarter results, adjusted earnings per share in 2012 are now expected to rise to approximately $9.45 per share, up $0.15 from the $9.30 per share guidance provided on February 16. The expected earnings contribution from Timberland in 2012 remains at approximately $1.10 per share.
Guidance for adjusted 2012 earnings per share now excludes two items: 1) Timberland acquisition-related expenses, currently estimated at $0.23 per share, and 2) the anticipated gain from the sale of John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc., which should approximate $0.20 per share. Inclusive of these two items, 2012 earnings per share on a GAAP basis is now expected to reach $9.42.
The impact of a slightly stronger than anticipated U.S. dollar on foreign currency translation rates versus our guidance benefitted first quarter earnings by $0.05 per share. Accordingly, the negative impact of foreign currency translation on full-year earnings per share is now expected to be $0.35 per share, versus the $0.41 per share anticipated in prior guidance. The assumed euro conversion rate for the second quarter of 2012 is 1.30, while the assumed rate for the second half remains unchanged at 1.25. The revised guidance continues to include a negative impact of $0.19 per share from higher pension expense in 2012.
Revenue guidance for 2012 remains unchanged, with revenues expected to rise by approximately 15% (17% in constant dollars) to $10.9 billion, with Timberland accounting for approximately $1 billion of the growth. Excluding Timberland, revenues should rise by approximately 6% (8% in constant dollars). Given the imminent sale of the John Varvatos business, current guidance excludes $70 million in John Varvatos revenues for the remainder of 2012.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, earnings per share comparisons will be particularly challenging due to several factors. First, while Timberland is on track for significant revenue and earnings accretion in 2012, it is a highly seasonal business. Accordingly, Timberland has historically posted a substantial loss in the second quarter. This loss is expected to approximate $30 million (equal to about $0.20 per share) in the second quarter, which is comparable to the loss reported by Timberland in its second quarter last year. Second quarter earnings will also reflect the continued negative impact from foreign currency translation and higher pension expense, which together should impact earnings per share by $0.09. Additionally, second quarter 2011 earnings benefitted by $0.07 from a gain from a facility closure. These factors are expected to negatively impact second quarter earnings comparisons by a combined $0.36 per share.
Adjusted Amounts
This release refers to adjusted amounts that exclude restructuring and other costs related to the acquisition of Timberland, which approximated $5 million ($0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 2012 and are currently estimated at $34 million ($0.23 per share) for the full year. Adjusted amounts referenced in conjunction with 2012 annual guidance also exclude the anticipated gain on the sale of John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc. of approximately $40 million (about $0.20 per share). Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.
Dividend Declared
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 per share, payable on June 18, 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 8, 2012.
