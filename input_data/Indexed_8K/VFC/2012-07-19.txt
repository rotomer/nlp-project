Weve reached the halfway mark of the year, and are right on track to deliver another year of strong and very profitable growth to our shareholders, said Eric Wiseman, VF Corporation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The strength of VFs business model  a diverse portfolio strategy supported by an intense focus on financial and operational disciplines  provides us with a clear competitive advantage as we successfully navigate through an increasingly uncertain economic environment.
Second Quarter Review
rose 16 percent to $2.1 billion from $1.8 billion in 2011, and included $239 million from Timberland. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 3 percent (6 percent in constant dollars), driven by strong growth in the Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by unseasonably warm weather that caused a slight shift in revenues from the second quarter to the first, and by the sale of John Varvatos in April 2012.
Revenues

Coalition Review
revenues increased 45 percent in the second quarter, with organic revenue growth of 12 percent (16 percent in constant dollars). The addition of the and brands contributed $239 million to revenues.
Outdoor & Action Sports
Timberland
Smartwool
Global revenues of brand during the quarter increased 14 percent (16 percent in constant dollars), with the Americas, Europe and Asia regions each growing in excess of 15 percent in constant dollars. brands direct-to-consumer business continued to post healthy growth, up 9 percent in the quarter. The brand achieved a 25 percent (29 percent in constant dollars) increase in global revenues in the quarter, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia. The Vans direct-to-consumer business also demonstrated solid results, with revenues rising by 18 percent. As anticipated, Timberlands revenues were flat in the quarter (up 2 percent in constant dollars).

Excluding Timberland, Outdoor & Action Sports operating income rose 22 percent and operating margin increased 110 basis points to 13.6 percent from 12.5 percent in the 2011 period. On a GAAP basis, due to the seasonally driven loss from Timberland and acquisition-related expenses, operating income for the coalition declined 8 percent and the operating margin was 7.9 percent.
For the first half of 2012, Outdoor & Action Sports revenues grew 53 percent, with organic revenue growth of 13 percent (16 percent in constant dollars). For the full year, we look forward to constant dollar organic revenues growing at a low- to mid-teen percentage rate.
revenues were down 3 percent (down 1 percent in constant dollars) in the quarter, reflecting a shift of spring seasonal products that boosted first quarter revenues. Double-digit revenue increases in the Western Specialty and Asian businesses, together with strong sales of jeans products, were offset by a modest decline in Mass channel revenues, lower revenues of the brand in the U.S. due to current challenges in the mid-tier channel, and soft conditions in Europe.
Jeanswear
Rock & Republic
Lee
Jeanswear operating margin was stronger than anticipated in the quarter, fueled by a higher gross margin reflecting lower manufacturing costs in our owned plants and tight inventory controls. Operating margin rose 30 basis points to 15.7 percent with operating income that was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2011.
During the first half of 2012, Jeanswear revenues rose 3 percent (5 percent in constant dollars), giving us confidence in our guidance for mid single-digit constant dollar revenue growth for the full year. Operating margin comparisons should continue to strengthen in the second half of the year.
revenues continued to grow in the second quarter, rising 3 percent, with increases in both the Image and Licensed Sports businesses. As expected, the revenue comparison was tempered by the exceptionally strong growth achieved in the prior years quarter.
Imagewear
Also as anticipated, operating income and margin both declined in the quarter, as product costs peaked in the current period.
Imagewear revenues for the first half increased 8 percent, with mid single-digit growth still anticipated for the full year. Despite the impact of higher product costs in the first half of 2012, Imagewear operating margin should improve in the second half and exceed 2011 levels for the full year.
revenues declined 2 percent in the second quarter, with double-digit growth in (U.S.) brand revenues offset by lower brand revenues. Nauticas results in the quarter were reduced by a shift in the timing of special programs, as well as lower distressed sales in the quarter. On the positive side, the brands full price wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses both achieved healthy growth in the quarter.

Balance Sheet Review
Inventories continue to be tightly controlled. Excluding Timberland, inventories rose only 3 percent from June 2011 levels. Total inventories rose 22 percent from the prior year. Higher short-term debt levels compared with June 2011 are attributable to working capital needs. Given strong cash generation, short-term borrowings are expected to be paid down by year-end.
2012 Earnings and Cash Flow Guidance Raised
Based on the strong results achieved in the first half of 2012, adjusted earnings per share in 2012 are now expected to rise to approximately $9.50 per share, up $0.05 from the $9.45 per share guidance provided on April 27. Revised guidance covers an additional negative impact from foreign currency exchange of $0.07 per share compared to prior guidance. Given an assumed euro to U.S. dollar conversion rate of 1.22 for the second half, the full year negative impact of foreign currency translation is now estimated at $0.42 per share. The impact from higher pension expense in 2012 remains $0.19 per share.
The expected earnings contribution from Timberland in 2012 remains approximately $1.10 per share.
Guidance for adjusted earnings per share continues to exclude two items: 1) Timberland acquisition-related expenses of $0.24 per share, and 2) the $0.32 per share gain from the sale of John Varvatos. Inclusive of these two items, 2012 earnings per share on a GAAP basis is now expected to reach $9.58.
