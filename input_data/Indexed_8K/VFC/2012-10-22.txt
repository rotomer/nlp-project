Timberland
Smartwool
As anticipated, global revenue growth in the current quarter for brand moderated from prior periods, increasing 5 percent, or 8 percent in constant dollars. High single-digit growth in the Americas region and exceptionally strong growth in Asia were offset by a mid-single digit constant dollar decline in Europe. brand remains on track for mid-teen constant dollar revenue growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The brand achieved a 21 percent (26 percent in constant dollars) increase in global revenues in the quarter, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia regions. Based on the brands exceptional performance year to date, full year constant dollar revenue growth should approximate 25 percent.

Excluding Timberland, Outdoor & Action Sports operating income rose 16 percent and operating margin increased 220 basis points to an all-time high of 25.7 percent compared with 23.5 percent in the 2011 period. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the coalition increased 29 percent with a flat year-over-year operating margin, reflecting the impact of Timberland.
Double-digit constant dollar revenue growth in Outdoor & Action Sports should continue in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance by and brands.

For the full year, Outdoor & Action Sports revenues are expected to grow at the higher end of the 25-30 percent range provided in February 2012, with constant dollar organic revenues growing at a mid-teen percentage rate.

These increases were offset by the continuation of challenging economic conditions in Europe.
Jeanswear
Jeanswear operating margin improved significantly, up 320 basis points to 18.3 percent with operating income up 19.8 percent over the prior year period.

revenues grew 3 percent in the third quarter. As expected, the revenue comparison was impacted by the exceptionally strong growth achieved in the prior years third quarter, which included expanded distribution in the protective apparel business. As anticipated, operating income and margin both declined in the quarter, as higher product costs continued to negatively impact the business. As these cost impacts subside, operating margin in the fourth quarter should increase over that of the prior years same period.
Imagewear
With strong first half growth from its Image business and strong second half growth from its Licensed Sports Group, Imagewear coalition revenues are on track for mid single-digit growth for the full year, consistent with guidance given in February. Operating margin should remain strong, approximating that of the prior year.

Balance Sheet Review
Inventories remain tightly controlled and were down 1 percent from September 2011 levels. Given anticipated strong cash generation, the company expects to pay off all commercial paper by the end of the year.
2012 Earnings Per Share Guidance Raised
Based on strong results achieved in the first nine months of 2012, full year adjusted earnings per share are now expected to be approximately $9.60 per share, up $0.10 from the $9.50 per share guidance provided on July 19. The company also indicated plans to increase its fourth quarter global marketing investment over previously expected levels, particularly in and brands, to capitalize on current momentum, support growth in key strategic regions and connect even more deeply with consumers. In addition, given a revised assumed euro to U.S. dollar conversion rate of 1.25 for the fourth quarter, the full year negative impact of foreign currency translation is now estimated at $0.35 per share compared to prior guidance of $0.42 per share.
The North Face

The expected adjusted earnings contribution from Timberland in 2012 remains at $1.10 per share, as compared with $0.60 in 2011, and is approximately $0.57 in the fourth quarter versus $0.34 in the same period of 2011. The impact on earnings from higher pension expense in 2012 remains at $0.19 per share. Guidance for adjusted earnings per share continues to exclude two items: 1) Timberland acquisition-related expenses of $0.24 per share, and 2) the $0.32 per share gain from the sale of John Varvatos. Inclusive of these two items, 2012 earnings per share on a GAAP basis is now expected to reach $9.68.
Top line guidance for 2012 remains at $10.9 billion, an increase of approximately 15 percent, or 17 percent in constant dollars, with Timberland accounting for just under $1 billion of the growth. Excluding Timberland, revenues are expected to rise by approximately 6 percent, or 8 percent in constant dollars. Each of the above comparisons includes about a one percentage point negative impact from the sale of John Varvatos.
Reflecting gross margin improvement across nearly all coalitions and an increasingly higher percentage of revenues coming from higher margin businesses, full year gross margin is expected to improve by approximately 80 basis points in 2012, driven by a substantial year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. The company continues to expect cash flow from operations to reach a record $1.2 billion in 2012.
In the fourth quarter, which marks the first fully comparable period with Timberland under VFs ownership, constant dollar revenue growth is expected to increase by about 7 percent over the same period last year. This also includes a one-percentage point negative impact from the sale of John Varvatos. Given expectations for stronger revenue growth comparisons across all coalitions, a greater contribution to earnings from its highly profitable and growing direct-to-consumer business, and more normalized product costs, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter should post the strongest comparison of the year, increasing by just over 30 percent.
Adjusted Amounts
This release refers to adjusted amounts that exclude restructuring and other costs related to the acquisition of Timberland, which approximated $14 million pretax ($0.10 per share) in the third quarter and $24 million pre-tax ($0.16 per share) in the first nine months of 2012, and are currently estimated at $35 million pre-tax ($0.24 per share) for the full year. Additionally, adjusted amounts in 2012 exclude the gain on the sale of John Varvatos of approximately $42 million pre-tax ($0.32 per share inclusive of a $0.10 per share tax benefit triggered by the sale). Adjusted amounts in 2011 exclude Timberland acquisition-related expenses of $26.6 million ($0.18 per share) in the third quarter and first nine months of the year. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.
