Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
                On December 19, 2005, New Viacom Corp. ("New Viacom") and Viacom Inc. ("Viacom") entered into a separation agreement that sets forth the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of New Viacom and Viacom (to be renamed CBS Corporation) following the separation of Viacom into two publicly traded companies consisting of the businesses of New Viacom and CBS Corporation ("CBS Corp.").
 
The separation agreement provides that:
 
 - 
                 
All of the assets primarily related to the New Viacom business as well as certain other specific assets, will be retained by or transferred to New Viacom or one of its subsidiaries;
 - 
                 
All of the assets of Viacom not retained by or transferred to New Viacom will be assets of CBS Corp. or one of its subsidiaries;

Liabilities will be allocated to and assumed by New Viacom to the extent they are related to the New Viacom business, as well as certain other specified liabilities;

Specified liabilities related to businesses of Viacom that were sold or discontinued prior to the date of the separation will be assumed by New Viacom or will remain with CBS Corp.; and

Shortly prior to the separation, which is expected to occur on December 31, 2005, New Viacom will pay a special cash dividend to Viacom (to be renamed CBS Corporation) in an amount sufficient to establish CBS Corp.'s opening debt balance from continuing operations at $7 billion, subject to certain adjustments.

All privileges relating to any claims, demands or Actions which involve members of both the CBS Group and the New Viacom Group in respect of which both parties retain any responsibility or Liability under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be subject to a shared privilege among them.  To allocate the interests of each party in the Information as to which any party is entitled to assert a privilege, whether or not such a privilege exists or the existence of which is in dispute, the parties agree as follows:
 
(a)           CBS shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with privileged Information which relates to the CBS Business and not to the New Viacom Business, whether or not the privileged Information is in the possession of or under the control of members of the CBS Group or the New Viacom Group.  CBS also shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with privileged Information which relates to the subject matter of any pending or future claim, demand or Action that is, or which CBS reasonably anticipates may become, a CBS Liability and that is not also, or that CBS reasonably anticipates will not become, a New Viacom Liability, whether or not the privileged Information is in the possession of or under the control of members of the CBS Group or the New Viacom Group.
 
(b)           New Viacom shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver of all privileges in connection with privileged Information which relates to the New Viacom Business and not to the CBS Business, whether or not the privileged Information is in the possession of or under the control of members of the CBS Group or the New Viacom Group.

Each party hereto shall ensure that no member of its respective Group may waive any privilege which could be asserted under any applicable Law, and in which the other party hereto has a shared privilege, without the written consent of the other party which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or as provided in paragraph (e) or (f) below.
(d)          
(e)           In the event of any claim, demand, Action or other dispute between the members of the New Viacom Group, on the one hand, and the members of the CBS Group, on the other hand, either such party may waive a privilege in which the other party has a shared privilege, without obtaining the consent of the other party; , , that such waiver of a shared privilege shall be effective only as to the use of Information with respect to the claim, demand, Action or other dispute between the members of the New Viacom Group, on the one hand, and the members of the CBS Group, on the other hand, and shall not operate as a waiver of the shared privilege with respect to third parties.

Each party hereto specifically agrees that it will not withhold consent to waiver for any purpose except to protect its own legitimate interests.
 
(g)           Upon receipt by either party hereto or by any Subsidiary thereof of any subpoena, discovery or other request which arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Information subject to a shared privilege or as to which the other party or a Subsidiary thereof has the sole right hereunder to assert a privilege, or if either party obtains knowledge that any of its or any of its Subsidiaries' current or former directors, officers, agents or employees have received any subpoena, discovery or other requests which arguably call for the production or disclosure of such privileged Information, such party shall promptly notify the other party of the existence of the request and shall provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to review the Information and to assert any rights it or they may have under this Section 3.08 or otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure of such privileged Information.
 
(h)           The transfer of all Records and other Information and each party's retention of Records and other Information which may include privileged Information of the other pursuant to this Agreement is made in reliance on the agreement of CBS and New Viacom, as set forth in Section 3.02 and this Section 3.08, to maintain the confidentiality of privileged Information and to assert and maintain all applicable privileges.

CBS and New Viacom shall negotiate the Allocation in good faith for a period not to exceed 30 days.  If CBS and New Viacom fail to agree upon the Allocation within such 30-day period, then each party shall be free to deliver an Escalation Notice pursuant to Section 10.02(a) and otherwise follow the dispute resolution provisions of Section 10.02.  For purposes of such Allocation as it relates to Insurance Charges, the parties agree that such Allocation shall be governed by the principle that the portion of any cap, stop-loss, limit or maximum applicable to an Insurance Charge that is unexhausted as of the Separation Date ("") is to be allocated on a 50/50 basis as between the members of the CBS Group, on the one hand, and the members of the New Viacom Group, on the other hand, to the extent, but only to the extent, that any member of one Group ultimately receives the benefit of Insurance Proceeds as a result of the exhaustion of the Unexhausted Insurance Charges by virtue of payments ultimately made by any member of the other Group in an amount greater than 50% of such Unexhausted Insurance Charges.  By way of illustration of this principle, if (i) the unexhausted aggregate self-insured retention as of the Separation Date were $1,000,000; (ii) a member of the CBS Group incurred a loss in the amount of $1,000,000, which loss was properly credited to the aggregate self-insured retention; and (iii) subsequently a member of the New Group incurred a loss in the amount of $200,000 and recovered Insurance Proceeds in the amount of $200,000, which amount would have been subject to the aggregate self-insured retention but for the $1,000,000 claim of such member of the CBS Group, such member of the CBS Group would have the right to recover from such member of the New Viacom Group the amount of $200,000.

The preceding sentence shall be implemented by reducing the Payment at the time such Payment is due to reflect the amount of such net Income Tax benefit, assuming for this purpose that any such net Income Tax benefit would be fully and immediately utilizable, unless such benefit is reflected in tax basis or similar item (""), in which case, assuming such Tax Basis would be fully and immediately utilizable over the depreciation or amortization period, if applicable, computed on a present value basis using 60% of the Adjusted Swap Rate.  If such Tax Basis not depreciable or amortizable, then the payee shall promptly refund to the payor the portion of such Payment or Payments equal to the net Income Tax benefits arising from such Tax Basis at the time such benefits are actually realized.
