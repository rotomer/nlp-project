Terms of Stock Options
(a)           .  The Stock Options shall be exercisable only to the extent the Participant is vested therein.  Subject to the other terms and conditions contained in the Certificate and in the Plan, the Stock Options shall vest in four installments of an equal whole number of Stock Options on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversary of the Date of Grant (any remaining Stock Options shall vest on whichever of the preceding vesting dates shall be determined by the Company in accordance with its customary procedures).
Vesting
(b)           .  Except as provided in Section 1.2(c) hereof, the period during which the Stock Options may be exercised shall expire on the eighth anniversary of the Date of Grant (the "Expiration Date").  If the Participant remains employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries through the Expiration Date, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable until the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Class B Common Stock is then listed.  Thus, if the Expiration Date is not a trading day, then the last day the Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the Expiration Date.

(c)           .
Exercise in the Event of Termination of Employment, Retirement, Permanent Disability or Death
(i)
                                    
Termination other than for Cause, or due to Retirement, Permanent Disability or Death
.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.2 or as otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of the Participant's termination of employment other than a Termination for Cause or due to the Participant's Retirement, Permanent Disability or death, the
Participant's Outstanding Stock Options can be exercised in accordance with the following provisions:
(A)
                             
if the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the voluntary termination by the Participant or the termination by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than a Termination for Cause, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent then exercisable until the earlier of six months after the date of such termination or the Expiration Date;
(B)
                               
if the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the Participant's Retirement, the Participant may exercise his or her Outstanding Stock Options to the extent exercisable on the date of Retirement until the earlier of the third anniversary of such date or the Expiration Date;
(C)
                               
if a Permanent Disability of the Participant occurs, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable upon the date of the onset of such Permanent Disability until the earlier of the third anniversary of such date or the Expiration Date; and
(D)
                              
if the Participant dies during a period during which his or her Stock Options could have been exercised by him or her, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable at the date of death by the person who acquired the right to exercise such Stock Options by will or the laws of descent and distribution or permitted transfer until the earlier of the second anniversary of the date of death or the Expiration Date.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.2 or as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon the occurrence of an event described in clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this Section 1.2(c)(i), all rights with respect to Stock Options that are not vested as of such event will be relinquished.  A "termination of employment" occurs, for purposes of the Stock Options, when a Participant is no longer an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the employment of a Participant who works for a Subsidiary shall terminate, for purposes of the Stock Options, on the date on which the Participant's employing company ceases to be a Subsidiary.
(ii)
                                 
Termination for Cause
.  If the Participant's employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ends due to a Termination for Cause then, unless the Committee in its discretion determines otherwise, all Outstanding Stock Options, whether or not then vested, shall terminate effective as of the date of such termination.
(iii)
                              
Exercise Periods following Termination of Employment, Retirement, Permanent Disability or Death
.  For the purposes of determining the dates on which Stock Options may be exercised following a termination of employment or Retirement, Permanent Disability or death, the day following the date of termination of employment or Retirement, Permanent Disability or death shall be the first day of the exercise period and the Stock Options may be exercised until the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Class B Common Stock is then listed.  Thus, if the last day of the exercise period is not a trading day, then the last date the Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the end of the exercise period.
Section 1.3     .
Exercise of Stock Options
(a)           .  The Participant may exercise all vested Outstanding Stock Options granted hereunder in whole at one time or in part in increments of 100 Stock Options (or in the entire number of Outstanding Stock Options in which the Participant is vested, if such number is less than 100) by notice to the Administrator, Long-Term Incentive Plans, Viacom Inc., 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, or to such agent(s) for the Company ("Agent") as the Company may from time to time specify, in such manner and at such address as may be specified from time to time by the Company.  Such notice shall (i) state the number of whole Stock Options being exercised, and (ii) be signed (or otherwise authorized in a manner acceptable to the Company) by the person or persons so exercising the Stock Options and, in the event the Stock Options are being exercised (pursuant to Section 1.2(c)(i) hereof) by any person or persons other than the Participant accompanied by proof satisfactory to the Company's counsel of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Stock Options.

Unless otherwise provided by the Company, such Exercise Price shall be paid in cash (e.g. personal bank check, certified check or official bank check).  In accordance with the rules and procedures established by the Committee for this purpose, the Stock Options may be exercised through a "cashless exercise" procedure, approved by the Committee, involving a broker or dealer, that affords the Participant the opportunity to sell immediately some or all of the shares underlying the exercised portion of the Stock Options in order to generate sufficient cash to pay the Exercise Price of the Stock Options.  In addition, if the Company so permits, the Exercise Price may be paid in whole or in part using a net share settlement procedure or through the withholding of shares subject to the Stock Options with a value equal to the Exercise Price.  In accordance with Section 4.3 hereof, the Participant shall make an arrangement acceptable to the Company to pay to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the combined federal, state,
