On May 24, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Viacom Inc. awarded performance-based restricted share units ("Performance-Based RSUs") under the Viacom Inc. 2006 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan (the "2006 LTMIP") to certain of Viacom's named executive officers and other executive officers. Vesting of the Performance-Based RSUs is conditioned on the change in the Company's stock price over a four-year period or portion thereof beginning on the date of grant relative to the change in the industry average for the S&P 500 companies in addition to the achievement of a specified level of operating income before depreciation and amortization during 2006, as previously determined by Viacom's Compensation Committee. Awards of Performance-Based RSUs were made to the following named executive officers of Viacom in accordance with the terms of their previously filed employment agreements as follows: Thomas E. Freston, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robert M. Bakish, Executive Vice President, Operations and Viacom Enterprises; Michael J. Dolan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael D. Fricklas, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. If any of the performance criteria are not achieved, the Performance-Based RSUs will not vest and will be cancelled. A copy of the 2006 LTMIP was filed as Exhibit 10.12 to Viacom's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.
