On July 27, 2006, the Board of Directors of Viacom Inc. approved changes to the compensation for Shari Redstone, the Non-Executive Vice Chair of Viacom's Board of Directors. Ms. Redstone's compensation, which had been identical to that of other directors, was increased to reflect her responsibilities as Vice Chair. Following the amendment, she will receive annual cash compensation of $200,000, payable in equal installments quarterly in advance and a per meeting attendance fee of $4,000. This amount will be in addition to grants of Restricted Stock Units and stock options under the Company's 2006 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors and the Company's 2006 RSU Plan for Outside Directors. The grants under such plans will not be affected by the amendment.
