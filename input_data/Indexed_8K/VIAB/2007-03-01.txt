Reported Results
 
 
Adjusted Results
This release includes adjusted financial information for 2006 and adjusted pro forma financial information for 2005 that is comparable to the Company's previously issued Business Outlook for the full year 2006 (see Basis of Presentation on page 5 of this release). For the full year 2006, adjusted operating income rose 10% to $2.86 billion from adjusted pro forma 2005 results of $2.60 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations for the full year 2006 increased 10% to $1.48 billion compared to adjusted pro forma 2005 net earnings from continuing operations of $1.35 billion. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year was $2.07, up 16% from an adjusted pro forma 2005 of $1.79.
Sumner M. Redstone, Executive Chairman of Viacom, said, "Viacom delivered solid results for 2006, guided by a new management team under the leadership of Philippe Dauman, who has
 
moved quickly to put the Company back on a steady path of success. I have great confidence that we will continue to build on the momentum of the last several months both in expanding our digital horizons and continuing to grow in traditional markets."
Philippe P. Dauman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Viacom, said, "We are making significant progress financially and operationally to ensure that we thrive in all distribution channels, including the evolving digital marketplace. Financially, our 2006 performance was strong, with double digit growth in revenues and operating income and 16% growth in adjusted net earnings per share.
"During the first quarter of this year, we took decisive steps to deploy our capital in more productive ways, including restructuring our operations here and abroad. At the same time, we continued to introduce popular new programming on our linear channels, to expand our digital operations organically and to reach innovative agreements with new digital partners. Additionally, we continue to expand on our position as a leading global provider of digital wireless video, and to innovate with new online sites and experiences."
Revenues
of $11.47 billion rose 19% from $9.61 billion in 2005, reflecting a 7% increase in Media Networks revenues to $7.24 billion, led by an increase of 11% in affiliate revenues to $2.03 billion. Worldwide advertising revenues were up 6% to $4.29 billion, while ancillary revenues grew 2% to $916 million. In 2006, acquisitions contributed $125 million in incremental revenues to Media Networks. The increase of 46% in Filmed Entertainment revenues to $4.38 billion in 2006 from $3.00 billion in 2005 principally reflected the acquisition of DreamWorks and distribution activities for DreamWorks Animation and the DreamWorks live-action library, which contributed $1.36 billion to 2006 revenues.
Full Year 2006 revenues
of $3.59 billion grew 32% from $2.72 billion in 2005. Media Networks revenues rose 4% to $2.08 billion from $1.99 billion in 2005 led by growth in affiliate revenues which were up 14% to $532 million. Worldwide advertising revenues rose 6% to $1.26 billion from $1.19 billion in 2005. Ancillary revenues declined 15% in the quarter versus 2005 to $289 million, principally due to timing and mix of home entertainment releases. Acquisitions contributed $78 million in incremental revenues to Media Networks in the quarter. Filmed
Fourth Quarter 2006 revenues
 
Entertainment revenues doubled to $1.57 billion, with the acquisition of DreamWorks and the distribution activities for DreamWorks Animation and the DreamWorks live-action library films contributing revenues of $560 million.
rose 10% to $2.86 billion compared to adjusted pro forma 2005 operating income of $2.60 billion. Incremental equity related compensation expense reduced 2006 adjusted operating income by $52 million ($20 million and $7 million in Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments, respectively). Media Networks adjusted operating income rose 10% to $2.92 billion in 2006 from adjusted pro forma 2005 results of $2.66 billion. Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating income was $137 million in 2006, up 18% from an adjusted pro forma 2005 operating income of $116 million. Corporate expenses reduced 2006 adjusted operating income by $197 million in 2006 and increased $27 million from adjusted pro forma expense in 2005.
Full Year 2006 adjusted operating income
was up 28% to $856 million compared to adjusted pro forma 2005 results of $670 million. Incremental 2006 equity related compensation expense reduced adjusted operating income by $21 million in the quarter ($6 million and $1 million in Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments, respectively). Media Networks adjusted operating income was $810 million, up 6% versus adjusted pro forma 2005 operating income of $762 million. Filmed Entertainment operating income in the quarter was $86 million, or $126 million higher than an adjusted pro forma 2005 operating loss of $40 million. Corporate expenses declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulting in a reduction in adjusted operating income of $43 million in both comparable periods.
Fourth Quarter 2006 adjusted operating income
 
 
NM = not meaningful
increased 10% to $1.48 billion compared to adjusted pro forma 2005 net earnings from continuing operations in line with the 10% increase in adjusted operating income. Pre-tax interest expense increased $209 million from adjusted pro forma 2005, reflecting incremental average debt outstanding, partially offset by lower adjusted tax expense of $78 million. On a diluted basis, adjusted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the year was $2.07, up 16% from adjusted pro forma 2005 net earnings from continuing operations of $1.79. The increase reflects higher adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and fewer weighted average number of common shares outstanding due to the Company's stock repurchase program.
Full Year 2006 adjusted net earnings from continuing operations
increased 62% to $456 million compared to adjusted pro forma 2005 net earnings from continuing operations of $282 million. The increase is attributable to an increase of 28% in adjusted operating income, and lower tax expense of $45 million, partially offset by higher interest expense of $51 million in 2006. On a diluted basis adjusted net earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter was $0.65.

Debt
At December 31, 2006 total debt outstanding, including capital leases increased to $7.65 billion, compared with $5.76 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase was driven by the Company's stock repurchase program and acquisitions, primarily DreamWorks.
 
Stock Repurchase Program
The Company has in place a $3.00 billion stock repurchase program. For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, 8.4 million shares were repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $324 million. For the year, the Company repurchased 60.3 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.35 billion. Through February 21, 2007, the Company acquired 62.5 million shares at a weighted average price per share of $38.96.
Special Dividend to Former Viacom
In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement, on December 29, 2005 the Company paid a preliminary special dividend to Former Viacom of $5.40 billion. In January 2007, a full settlement was reached with and paid to CBS Corporation for an additional $170 million. The settlement amount was accrued in the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 with a corresponding reduction in additional paid-in capital.
Basis of Presentation
Operating income, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are presented on an adjusted basis that excludes discrete net charges related to Viacom corporate senior management changes of $73 million ($11 million in the fourth quarter), international restructuring charges of $15 million in the Media Networks segment in the fourth quarter, and net discrete tax credits of $142 million ($42 million in the fourth quarter). Reconciliations of adjusted 2006 results to reported 2006 results and other non-GAAP measures are provided in tables on page 12 included in this release.
Viacom completed its separation from CBS Corporation (formerly Viacom Inc.) on December 31, 2005. Consequently, Viacom's reported results for 2005 are presented on a "carve-out" basis consistent with the results presented in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2006. Full year and fourth quarter 2005 operating income, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in this release include pro forma financial information as if the Company's separation from CBS Corporation had occurred at the beginning of 2005, and exclude certain unusual 2005 charges discussed in the reconciliation tables that follow.
The tables on pages 10 and 11 of this release reconcile 2005 pro forma results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 to reported results. The table on page 13 reconciles
 
2005 pro forma results to 2005 adjusted pro forma results presented in this release. Except as otherwise noted, the 2005 pro forma results presented in this release do not consider the impact to interest expense, net and provision for income taxes of the Company's issuances of debt securities during 2006.
Subsequent Events
In February 2007, the Media Networks segment's MTV Networks commenced restructuring actions affecting its domestic and international operations. The actions are anticipated to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2007 and result in 2007 restructuring charges, principally severance, of approximately $70 million, with approximately $50 million of such charges reflected in the first quarter of 2007.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following tables reconcile the Company's results for 2006 to adjusted results for the periods presented. The Company uses adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the segregation of charges related to Corporate management changes, international restructuring actions and discrete tax benefits is relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company's operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies. Since adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share as indicators of operating performance. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share as the Company calculates them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(continued)
The following tables reconcile the Company's 2005 pro forma results for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2005 to 2005 adjusted pro forma results. The Company separated from CBS Corporation (formerly Viacom Inc.) on December 31, 2005. In conjunction with the separation, the overhead structures at the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments were rationalized, with severance charges related to these rationalizations having been incurred in 2005. Additionally, decisions were taken in 2005 by Paramount's new senior leadership to abandon certain development projects begun by former management. As a result of these actions, unusual charges for severance and theatrical inventory write downs have been separately disclosed and noted as adjustments to the pro forma results of the periods presented. The Company believes that the segregation of these unusual items in conjunction with the pro forma adjustments is relevant and useful information for investors because it better allows investors to understand the performance of the business on a consistent basis. Since adjusted pro forma operating income, adjusted pro forma net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted pro forma diluted earnings per share are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share as indicators of operating performance. Adjusted pro forma operating income, adjusted pro forma net earnings and adjusted pro forma diluted earnings per share as the Company calculates them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
