2006 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan
(Amended and Restated April 12, 2007)
 
  
Terms and Conditions to the Stock Option Certificate
 
ARTICLE I
TERMS OF STOCK OPTIONS
 
Section 1.1    
Grant of Stock Options
.  The Stock Options have been awarded to the Participant subject to the terms and conditions contained in (A) the confirmation for the
May 29, 2007 grant of Stock Options provided to the Participant (the "Stock Option Certificate") and the Terms and Conditions contained herein (collectively, the "Certificate") and (B) the Plan, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference.  A copy of the Plan is being provided simultaneously on-line or attached hereto.  Capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Stock Option Certificate or the Plan.  The Stock Options are
not
intended to be, or qualify as, "Incentive Stock Options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
 
 
(a)          
Exercisability
.  The Stock Options shall be exercisable only to the extent the Participant is vested therein.  Subject to the other terms and conditions contained in the Certificate and in the Plan, the Stock Options shall vest in four installments of an approximately equal whole number of Stock Options on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversary of the Date of Grant (any remaining Stock Options shall vest on whichever of the preceding vesting dates shall be determined by the Company in accordance with its customary procedures).
 
(b)          
Option Period
.  Except as provided in Section 1.2(c) hereof, the period during which the Stock Options may be exercised shall expire on the eighth anniversary of the Date of Grant (the "Expiration Date").  If the Participant remains employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries through the Expiration Date, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable until the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Class B Common Stock is then listed.  Thus, if the Expiration Date is not a trading day, then the last day the Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the Expiration Date.
 
(c)          
Exercise in the Event of Termination of Employment, Retirement, Death or Permanent Disability
.
 
1
 
(i)
           
Termination other than for Cause, or due to Retirement, Death or Permanent Disability
.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.2 or as otherwise determined by the Committee (including in any applicable employment agreement), in the event of the Participant's termination of employment other than a termination of employment for Cause or due to the Participant's Retirement, Permanent Disability or death, the Participant's Outstanding Stock Options can be exercised in accordance with the following provisions:
 
(A)
         
if the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the voluntary termination by the Participant or the termination by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than a termination of employment for Cause, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent then exercisable until the earlier of six months after the date of such termination or the Expiration Date;
 
(B)
         
if the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the Participant's Retirement, he or she may exercise his or her Outstanding Stock Options to the extent exercisable on the date of Retirement until the earlier of the third anniversary of such date or the Expiration Date;
 
(C)
         
if a Permanent Disability of the Participant occurs, the Participant's Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable upon the date of the onset of such Permanent Disability until the earlier of the third anniversary of such date or the Expiration Date; and
 
(D)
         
if the Participant dies during a period during which his or her Stock Options could have been exercised by him or her, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable at the date of death by the person who acquired the right to exercise such Stock Options by will or the laws of descent and distribution, permitted transfer or beneficiary designation until the earlier of the second anniversary of the date of death or the Expiration Date.
 
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.2 or as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon the occurrence of an event described in clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this Section 1.2(c)(i), all rights with respect to Stock Options that are not vested as of such event will be relinquished.  A "termination of employment" occurs, for purposes of the Stock Options, when a Participant is no longer an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the employment of a Participant who works for a Subsidiary shall terminate, for purposes of the Stock Options, on the date on which the Participant's employing company ceases to be a Subsidiary.
 
2
(ii)
          
Termination for Cause
.  If the Participant's employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ends due to a termination of employment for Cause then, unless the Committee in its discretion determines otherwise, all Outstanding Stock Options, whether or not then vested, shall terminate effective as of the date of such termination.
 
(iii)
        
Exercise Periods following Termination of Employment, Retirement, Permanent Disability or Death
.  For the purposes of determining the dates on which Stock Options may be exercised following a termination of employment or Retirement, Permanent Disability or death, the day following the date of termination of employment or Retirement, Permanent Disability or death shall be the first day of the exercise period and the Stock Options may be exercised until the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Class B Common Stock is then listed.  Thus, if the last day of the exercise period is not a trading day, then the last date the Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the end of the exercise period.
 
 
(a)          
Whole or Partial Exercise
.  The Participant may exercise all vested Outstanding Stock Options granted hereunder in whole at one time or in part in increments of 100 Stock Options (or in the entire number of Outstanding Stock Options in which the Participant is vested, if such number is less than 100) by notice to the Director, Global Equity Services, Viacom Inc., 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, or to such agent(s) for the Company ("Agent") as the Company may from time to time specify, in such manner and at such address as may be specified from time to time by the Company.  Such notice shall (i) state the number of Stock Options being exercised, and (ii) be signed (or otherwise authorized in a manner acceptable to the Company) by the person or persons so exercising the Stock Options and, in the event the Stock Options are being exercised (pursuant to Section 1.2(c)(i) hereof) by any person or persons other than the Participant accompanied by proof satisfactory to the Company's counsel of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Stock Options.  Information concerning any Agent and its address may be obtained by contacting the Director, Global Equity Services.
 
(b)          
Payment of Purchase Price Upon Exercise
.  Full payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (which shall be determined by multiplying the number of Stock Options being exercised by the Exercise Price as set forth on the Stock Option Certificate) shall be made on or before the settlement date for the shares of Class B Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Options.  Unless otherwise provided by the Company, such Exercise Price shall be paid in cash (e.g. personal bank check, certified check or official bank check).  In accordance with the rules and procedures established by the Company for this purpose, the Stock Options may be exercised through a procedure, approved by the Company from time to time, involving a
 
3
broker or dealer, that affords the Participant the opportunity to sell immediately some or all of the shares underlying the exercised portion of the Stock Options in order to generate sufficient cash to pay the Exercise Price of the Stock Options.  In addition, if the Company so permits, the Exercise Price may be paid in whole or in part using a net share settlement procedure or through the withholding of shares subject to the Stock Options with a value equal to the Exercise Price. 
 
(c)          
Outstanding Stock Options
.  The number of shares of Class B Common Stock subject to the Stock Options that is set forth on the Stock Option Certificate may not reflect the number of Outstanding Stock Options due to Stock Option exercises or adjustments pursuant to Article II.
 
ARTICLE II
EFFECT OF CERTAIN CORPORATE CHANGES
 
In the event of a merger, consolidation, stock split, reverse stock split, dividend, distribution, combination, reclassification, reorganization, split-up, spin-off or recapitalization that changes the character or amount of the Class B Common Stock or any other changes in the corporate structure, equity securities or capital structure of the Company, the Committee shall make such adjustments, if any, to the number and kind of securities subject to the Stock Options, and the Exercise Price of the Stock Options, in each case, as it deems appropriate.

Viacom Inc.
2006 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan
(Amended and Restated April 12, 2007)
 
Terms and Conditions to the Performance Share Units
ARTICLE I
TERMS OF PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS
Section 1.1
        
Grant of Performance Share Units
. The Performance Share Units (the "
Performance Share Units
") have been awarded to the Participant subject to the terms and conditions contained in (A) the confirmation for the May 29, 2007 grant of Performance Share Units provided to the Participant (the "
Performance Share Units Certificate
") and the Terms and Conditions contained herein (collectively, the "
Certificate
") and (B) the Plan, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference. A copy of the Plan is being provided simultaneously on-line or attached hereto. Capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Performance Share Units Certificate or the Plan. Performance Share Units are notional units of measurement and represent the right to receive a number of shares of Class B Common Stock determined on the basis of the performance of the Class B Common Stock in comparison to the performance of the common stock of companies comprising the Reference Group, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate.
 
(a)
          
Valuation
. As of the Determination Date, the TSR of the Class B Common Stock over the relevant Measurement Period will be measured against the TSR of the common stock of the companies comprising the Reference Group over the relevant Measurement Period. Subject to Section 1.2(b), the percentile ranking of the TSR of the Shares as compared to the companies comprising the Reference Group will be used to calculate the number of shares of Class B Common Stock that the Participant will receive, in accordance with the following schedule (the "
Schedule
"):
 
 
1
 
 
For Company achievement at an intermediate points between the 25th and 50th percentile, or between the 50th percentile and the 100th percentile, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock to be delivered will be interpolated between the respective number of shares delivered at such percentiles. For example, if the Company were to achieve the 70th percentile TSR, the number of Shares to be delivered would be [140%] [180%] of the Target Award.
(b)
          
EPS Valuation Rule
. Notwithstanding the valuation principles set forth in Section 1.2(a), if for the Measurement Period for the award (I) the Company achieves less than the 50th percentile TSR, and (II) its earnings per share ("
EPS
") exceed a hurdle which has been specified by the Committee, then the number of shares of Class B Common Stock to be delivered under the award will equal the arithmetic average of the Target Award and the number of shares that would be received under the award pursuant to the Schedule, rounded up to the nearest whole share.
(c)
          
Settlement and Delivery of Shares
. Shares delivered in settlement of the Performance Share Units will be delivered, net of any Shares withheld to satisfy taxes, as follows:
(i)
           
If the Company achieves at least the 50th percentile TSR, shares of Class B Common Stock will be delivered no later than four (4) weeks following the Determination Date; and
(ii)
          
If the Company does not achieve at least the 50th percentile TSR, (I) shares of Class B Common Stock determined pursuant to the Schedule, if any, will be delivered no later than four (4) weeks following the Determination Date and (II) any incremental shares of Class B Common Stock to which the Participant is entitled by virtue of Section 1.2(b), if any, will be delivered on the second business day following the delivery of the Company's audited financial statements in respect of the last year of
 
2
the applicable Measurement Period (so that it can be determined whether or not the Company attained the EPS hurdle in respect of such award).
(i)
           
In the event the Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates in a Qualifying Termination prior to December 31, 2009, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock that the Participant will receive for the applicable Measurement Period will be determined by multiplying the shares of Class B Common Stock determined under the applicable valuation criteria under Section 1.2(a) or (b) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days starting with and inclusive of January 1, 2007 and ending on the applicable Determination Date and the denominator of which is the number of days starting with and inclusive of January 1, 2007 and ending on December 31, 2009.
(ii)
          
In the event the Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination, the Participant shall forfeit all unvested Performance Share Units as of the date of such event
ARTICLE II
EFFECT OF CERTAIN CORPORATE CHANGES
In the event of a merger, consolidation, stock split, reverse stock split, dividend, distribution, combination, reclassification, reorganization, split-up, spin-off or recapitalization that changes the character or amount of the Class B Common Stock or any other changes in the corporate structure, equity securities or capital structure of the Company, the Committee shall make such adjustments, if any, to the number and kind of securities subject to the Performance Share Units, as it deems appropriate. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, also make such other adjustments as it deems appropriate in order to preserve the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available hereunder. Such determinations by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all persons for all purposes.
