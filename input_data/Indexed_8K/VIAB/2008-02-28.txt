Sumner M. Redstone, Executive Chairman of Viacom, said, "The progress we achieved this past year across the Company has been tremendous. In his first full year as CEO, Philippe Dauman has solidified Viacom's standing as the leading entertainment content company in the world, reaffirmed our creative leadership and successfully extended the reach of our powerful brands into new digital markets and new business ventures. I am confident that
he and his team will continue to build on this momentum, optimizing our assets and delivering greater shareholder value."
"Creative innovation and strong execution were keys to our success in 2007, for which I give a lot of credit to our Chief Administrative and Financial Officer Tom Dooley as well as our talented operational leaders, Brad Grey, Debra Lee and Judy McGrath," said Philippe Dauman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Viacom. "Across our Media Networks business, we made substantive changes domestically and internationally to enhance our operations, from programming development and advertising to digital initiatives and new branded business ventures. Our investments in original programming paid off, driving ratings gains and putting us in a strong position to continue to grow advertising revenues. By increasing our capability and reach in the digital arena, we comfortably surpassed our goal of generating $500 million in digital revenues for the year. Today, our digital operations have reached a critical mass with more than 300 online properties, the Flux social networking platform, a thriving online casual gaming business and prominent mobile presence. The fourth quarter launch of our console game Rock Band was an unqualified success, setting the foundation for another valuable franchise.
"A strong slate of films propelled Paramount to the number one marketshare position in 2007 with the DreamWorks/Paramount blockbuster leading the charge. We have made substantial progress in repositioning the studio creatively, focusing on our brands and franchises. That work will continue as we look forward to a promising slate in 2008."

Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Company's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: advertising market conditions and developments in the Company's markets worldwide and, in particular, for advertisements targeting demographics served by the Company's program services and other content outlets; the public acceptance of and ratings for the Company's movies, programs, digital services and other content, along with the level of viewership of advertisements on these platforms; competition for advertising dollars from online and wireless-based services, content providers and distributors, and various intermediaries; technological developments and their effect in the Company's markets and on consumer behavior; fluctuations in our results due to the timing, mix and availability of our programming, motion pictures and other content; changes in the Federal communications laws and regulations applicable to cable operations, including the possibility of mandatory  la carte programming or limitation on the packaging of program services; the impact of piracy on the Company's programming and films; the impact of increased scale in parties involved in the distribution and aggregation of the Company's products and program services to consumers and advertisers; the impact of union activity, including possible work stoppages or our inability to negotiate favorable terms for contract renewals; other domestic and global economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting the Company's businesses generally; and other factors described in the Company's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to the Company's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

The following tables reconcile the Company's results for the full year and quarter ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to adjusted results that exclude the impact of restructuring activities, the realized gain on the sale of the Company's non-controlling interest in MTV Russia, an impairment charge associated with the write-down of Amp'd Mobile and net discrete tax benefits. The Company uses adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance in the absence of these items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the exclusion of these items is relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the Company's management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company's operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies. Since adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for operating income, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
