NM = Not Meaningful
Revenues for the full year 2008 grew 9% to $14.63 billion driven by solid growth in both the Filmed Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Operating income declined 14% to $2.52 billion reflecting the year-over-year net impact of restructuring and other charges as well as higher expenses. Reported net earnings for the year were down 32% to $1.25 billion, or diluted net earnings per share (EPS) of $2.00.
On December 4, 2008, Viacom announced restructuring plans to better align its organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. In addition, following a strategic review of its operations, the Company wrote down certain programming and other assets. These activities resulted in an aggregate of $454 million of restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the impact of these charges and other items, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $2.38 versus $2.36 in 2007. Adjustments for the full-year and fourth quarter 2008 and 2007 results are detailed in the Supplemental Disclosures table at the end of this release.
Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were flat year-over-year at $4.24 billion. Operating income was down 51% to $475 million, including the impact of $454 million in restructuring and other charges taken in the quarter. Reported net earnings and diluted net EPS for the quarter declined to $173 million and $0.28 respectively. Excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 10% to $0.76 compared with $0.84 in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Sumner M. Redstone, Executive Chairman of Viacom, said, "There is no doubt that global economic conditions are difficult right now. Having worked through turbulent times before, I know that it is in such times that companies with strong, resilient assets distinguish themselves. With enduring brands and a proven leadership team, Viacom is well prepared to manage through this environment and thrive over the long term."
Philippe Dauman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Viacom, said, "Our fourth quarter results reflect the realities of a challenging economy. The broad marketplace conditions weighed on our advertising, home entertainment and consumer products businesses. That was offset, however, by solid growth in our affiliate and theatrical revenues, both up double digits. Ratings trends at several of our core networks are improving as new programming gains traction and we are looking forward to a promising motion picture slate anchored by three upcoming tentpoles, J.J. Abrams' , and .

"While our strategy remains firmly focused on building our brands for long-term success, we also have great confidence in our ability to execute successfully today. We acted early and decisively to prepare for the rapid decline in economic conditions. Without sacrificing the creation of great content, we aggressively managed our cost structure, which significantly boosted cash flow and further strengthened our balance sheet. The restructuring actions we took late last year will result in approximately $200 million in savings this year. While it is difficult to know how long these conditions will persist, our actions have positioned us very well to seize the opportunities that will arise as the economy recovers."

The following tables reconcile the Company's results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to adjusted results that exclude the impact of restructuring and other charges, a realized gain on the sale of the Company's non-controlling investment in MTV Russia, impairment charges of minority investments and net discrete tax benefits. The Company uses adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance in the absence of these items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, improves their ability to understand the Company's operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies. Since adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for operating income, net earnings and diluted EPS as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
