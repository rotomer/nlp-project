On May 5, 2009, National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI"), the beneficial owner of a controlling interest in Viacom Inc. ("Viacom" or the "Company"), issued a press release announcing that it has restructured its existing indebtedness on the terms it previously announced and entered into definitive agreements with its creditors. According to the press release, the agreements extend the maturity of the existing indebtedness to December 31, 2010, with certain repayments due in late 2009 and in 2010. In addition, NAI stated that it has pledged substantially all of its assets to secure the restructured indebtedness. NAI's assets include, among other assets, its shares of Viacom Class A and Class B common stock and the shares of NAI's wholly-owned subsidiary, NAIRI, Inc., which directly owns the Viacom shares. It is the Company's understanding that a default under the definitive agreements by NAI could cause a foreclosure with respect to the shares of Viacom common stock subject to the pledge, which could result in a future change of control of the Company.
