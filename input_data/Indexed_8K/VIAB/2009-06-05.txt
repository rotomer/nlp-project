On June 3, 2009, in connection with its annual grants under the Viacom Inc. ("Viacom" or the "Company") 2006 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan, as amended and restated December 2, 2008 (the "LTMIP"), the Company's Compensation Committee granted restricted share units ("RSUs") and stock options to approximately 190 management employees, including certain of the Company's executive officers. This year, 60% of the value of each award was granted in RSUs, valued using the closing price of the Company's Class B common stock on June 3, 2009, and 40% of the value of each award was granted in stock options, valued using Black-Scholes methodology. In accordance with pre-existing employment agreements, Sumner M. Redstone, Philippe P. Dauman and Thomas E. Dooley received stock options representing 50% of the value of their annual awards; performance share units ("PSUs") representing the other 50% of the value of their annual awards were granted on January 1, 2009. Lower level management continued to receive equity awards 100% in the form of RSUs. Both the RSUs and stock options vest in equal annual installments over a period of four years. The stock options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of Viacom's Class B common stock on June 3, 2009.
 
The terms and conditions for the stock options, RSUs and PSUs were filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on May 29, 2007. A copy of the LTMIP was filed with the Company's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K on February 12, 2009. The terms of the equity awards are also described in the Company's Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2009. These filings are also available on the Company's website at www.viacom.com/investorrelations.
