Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company and NAI, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares under this Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.
 
The relative fault of the Company and NAI, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and NAI or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company, NAI, and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, (i) NAI shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount equal to the proceeds (after deducting Underwriters discounts but before expenses) received by NAI and/or the Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Shares by it under this Agreement, and (ii) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares
 
20
 
 
purchased and sold by it hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each director, officer and affiliate of each Underwriter, shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director and affiliate of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule 1 hereto, and not joint.
 
8.       .  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or of NAI submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company or NAI, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.

(b)           if the number of Defaulted Shares exceeds 10% of the total number of Shares to be purchased at the Closing Time, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Shares.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
