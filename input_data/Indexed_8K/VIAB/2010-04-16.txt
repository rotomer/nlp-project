Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
 
(e)          On April 14, 2010, Viacom Inc. (Viacom) entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the Agreement) with Philippe Dauman, Viacoms President and Chief Executive Officer, reflecting terms approved by the Viacom Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) earlier that day.  The Agreement extends Mr. Daumans term of employment to December 31, 2016 with the following modifications:
 
.  Effective January 1, 2010, Mr. Daumans salary was increased from $2.5 million to $3.5 million annually, subject to annual merit reviews by the Compensation Committee.
Base Salary
.  Effective January 1, 2010, Mr. Daumans target annual cash bonus under Viacoms Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan was increased to $12 million from $9.5 million, subject to the achievement of performance goals established by the Viacom Compensation Committee.  The target bonus amount is subject to annual merit reviews.
Annual Performance-Based Cash Bonus
On April 14, 2010, Mr. Dauman received a grant of 1 million performance restricted share units (PRSUs) that will vest in four equal annual installments beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and will deliver, at the time of vesting, 75% to 125% of the shares underlying the PRSUs, depending on the achievement of company financial targets over specified periods.  On April 20, 2010, Mr. Dauman will be granted stock options to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock, which will vest in four equal annual installments and have an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our Class B common stock on the date of grant.
One-Time Equity Awards.  
.  Mr. Daumans annual equity awards are unchanged, and he will continue to receive an annual grant of performance share units (PSUs) with a value equal to $6 million on January 1 of each year and an annual grant of stock options with a Black-Scholes value equal to $6 million on the same day that the Committee makes its annual grant of equity awards to employees generally.  The terms of the PSUs and stock options are consistent with prior grants.
Annual Equity Awards
.  Mr. Dauman will continue to be eligible to participate in Viacoms retirement and other employee benefit plans for which he qualifies pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan, and he will continue to receive life insurance coverage in the amount of $5 million.
Benefits
The agreement provides for severance benefits upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason, as those terms are defined in the agreement, including the vesting of certain equity awards and cash severance capped at 3 times base salary and bonus amounts.
Other Provisions.
