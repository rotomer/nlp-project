[
 
 Viacom Inc. (NYSE: VIA, VIA.B) today announced the reference yield, the total consideration and the tender offer consideration for the previously announced cash tender offer for up to $500 million of its outstanding 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Notes). The tender offer is scheduled to expire at midnight on March 14, 2011, unless the tender offer is extended or terminated. The terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in an Offer to Purchase dated February 14, 2011 (the Offer to Purchase) and related Letter of Transmittal.
NEW YORK, February 28, 2011
The reference yield for the tender offer was determined at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, today. The total consideration and the tender offer consideration for the 2016 Notes are based on the reference yield plus the fixed spread as set forth in the table below:
 
As described in the Offer to Purchase, Viacom expects to accept for purchase 33.33% of the 2016 Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, today (the Early Tender Date), and such 2016 Notes accepted for purchase are expected to be settled on March 1, 2011.
Tendered 2016 Notes may be withdrawn at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, today (the Withdrawal Date), but may not be withdrawn after the Withdrawal Date, except in certain limited circumstances where Viacom determines that additional withdrawal rights are required by law. Withdrawn 2016 Notes may be re-tendered at any time prior to the expiration of the tender offer. The tender offer is subject to certain customary conditions. The tender offer is not
 
 
 
 
 
conditioned on the tender of a minimum principal amount of 2016 Notes. Viacom may amend, extend or, subject to certain conditions, terminate the tender offer at any time.
Holders that validly tender on or prior to the Early Tender Date and do not validly withdraw their 2016 Notes on or prior to the Withdrawal Date and whose 2016 Notes are accepted for purchase will receive the total consideration indicated in the table above, depending on when such 2016 Notes are settled. Holders that validly tender after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to the expiration of the tender offer and whose 2016 Notes are accepted for purchase will receive the tender offer consideration indicated in the table above.
With respect to any 2016 Notes accepted for purchase in the tender offer, Viacom will pay accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the applicable date of payment for the purchased 2016 Notes.
For this tender offer, Viacom has retained BofA Merrill Lynch, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo Securities to serve as dealer managers, and Global Bondholder Services Corporation to serve as the information agent and depositary.
