If the board of directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.  If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2 at the adjourned meeting.
 
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action without a meeting, (including by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission as permitted by law), the board of directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall be not more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and no prior action by the board of directors is required by the DGCL, the record date shall be the first date on which a consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
 
 
10
 
delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed by Article II, Section 10 hereof.  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by the DGCL with respect to the proposed action by consent of the stockholders without a meeting, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such action.  If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
 
 
Section 3.
 
The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
 
 
 
Section 1.
 
.  The Corporation shall indemnify any present or former employee of the Corporation who was or is involved in or is threatened to be involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (such person, an indemnitee), to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment and unless applicable law otherwise requires, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees), actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in Section 7 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee, if and only if the board of directors
Right to Indemnification
 
 
11
 
authorized the bringing of the action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) in advance of the commencement of the proceeding.
 
Section 2.
 
.  To the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

In all other instances where any person shall serve or has served as an employee of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which it is or was otherwise interested, if it is not otherwise established that such person is or was serving as such employee at the request of the Corporation, the board of directors of the Corporation may determine whether such service is or was at the request of the Corporation, and it shall not be necessary to show any actual or prior request for such service.  For purposes of this Article VII, references to a corporation include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger (including any constituent of a constituent) as well as the resulting or surviving corporation so that any person who is or was an employee of such a constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as an employee of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would if he or she had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.  For purposes of this Article VII, references to other enterprises shall include employee benefit plans; references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service as an employee of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such employee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries, and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation as referred to in this Article VII.
 
Section 7.
 
.  (a) If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, or a claim under Section 3 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.  Any such written claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII shall include such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  Any written claim under Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Article VII shall include reasonable documentation of the expenses incurred by the indemnitee.
Proceedings to Enforce Rights to Indemnification
 
(b)
 
If successful in whole or in part in any suit brought pursuant to Section 7(a) of this Article VII, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking to the extent an undertaking would be required of a present director or officer of the Corporation pursuant to Article VI of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (an undertaking), the indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid and indemnified for the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.
 
(c)
 
In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the
 
 
13
 
 
 
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.  In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
 
Section 8.
 
.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an employee of the Corporation, or has ceased to serve at the request of the Corporation as an employee of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.  Any repeal or modification of this Article VII by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall not adversely affect any right or protection of an employee of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
