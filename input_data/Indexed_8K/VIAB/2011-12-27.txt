On December 19, 2011, the resolution accountants in the private dispute resolution process between Viacom Inc. (the Company) and former shareholders of Harmonix Music Systems, Inc. (Harmonix), a developer of music-based games, including the franchise, issued their determination with respect to the final amount of the earn-out the former shareholders are entitled to receive under the acquisition agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired Harmonix in 2006.  The resolution accountants determined that the Company owes an additional $383 million as compared to the $700 million sought by the former shareholders.

The Company filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery today seeking to compel the resolution accountants to consider arguments and evidence that were improperly excluded and to vacate the determination of the resolution accountants on the grounds of manifest error.
Pending the outcome of the suit, the effect of the determination of the resolution accountants will be reflected in discontinued operations for the first fiscal quarter of 2012.
