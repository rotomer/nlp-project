On March 12, 2002, upon the recommendation of the audit committee, the board of directors of Valero Energy Corporation ("Valero" or the "Company") approved the dismissal of Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") as the Company's independent auditors following the 2001 audit and the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2002. The appointment of Ernst & Young was ratified by Valero's stockholders at the Company's 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 9, 2002. On June 12, 2002, Valero, as the Plan Administrator of the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan (the "Plan"), dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as the independent auditors of the Plan for the year ending December 31, 2001, and selected Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Plan's independent auditors. Arthur Andersen's reports on the Plan's financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and through the date hereof, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Arthur Andersen to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its report on the Plan's financial statements for such years, and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Plan Administrator provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures.
