The Securities are to be issued under an Indenture (the "INDENTURE") specified in Schedule A hereto. The Company hereby appoints the Placement Agents as its exclusive agents for the 1
solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities from the Company by the Depositor during the period (the "AGENCY PERIOD") commencing on the date hereof and ending at the close of business on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), and each Placement Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company shall not appoint any other entity or person to act on its behalf, or to assist it, in the placement of the Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto agree that no Placement Agent shall be obligated, under any circumstance, to purchase Securities from the Company, as principal or otherwise. The Company hereby authorizes and directs the Placement Agents to deliver a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) to each purchaser of Pass-Through Certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") issued under the Trust Agreement, to be dated as of November 20, 2002 (the "TRUST AGREEMENT"), among the Depositor, Banc of America Securities LLC, as administrative agent, and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "CERTIFICATES TRUSTEE"). Furthermore, each of the Company and the Placement Agents (i) acknowledges that the Certificates Trustee will assign to purchasers and subsequent holders of the Certificates its rights against the Company and such Placement Agent under U.S. federal and state securities laws with respect to its purchase of the Notes and (ii) agrees not to contest the enforceability of such assignment. The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "SECURITIES ACT"), a registration statement (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule A hereto) on Form S-3, relating to certain debt securities (the "SHELF SECURITIES") to be issued from time to time by the Company. The Company also has prepared and filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities, and proposes to file with the Commission a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities. The registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement is hereinafter referred to as the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT" and the related prospectus covering the Shelf Securities in the form first delivered to purchasers of Certificates after the date hereof in connection with sales of the Certificates is hereinafter referred to as the "BASIC PROSPECTUS". The Basic Prospectus as supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities in the form first delivered to purchasers of Certificates after the date hereof in connection with sales of the Certificates is hereinafter referred to as the "PROSPECTUS". If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "RULE 462 REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Basic 2
Prospectus as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement (a "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS") or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "EXCHANGE ACT") on or before the date of this Agreement or the date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. 1. The Company hereby agrees with the Placement Agents as follows: (a) On the basis of the representations and warranties set forth herein, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Placement Agent, acting solely as an agent of the Company, will use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers from the Depositor during the Agency Period for the purchase of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities from the Company specified opposite its name in Schedule B attached hereto. Each Placement Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer for the purchase of Securities it has solicited on an agency basis during the Agency Period. In the event that a Placement Agent orally communicates to the Company during the Agency Period that it has received an offer for the purchase of Securities from the Depositor at a price at least equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, then the Company shall accept such offer in whole, provided that the aggregate of all such offers does not exceed $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Securities; provided, however, that each such offer shall provide for the settlement of the purchase and sale of the Securities on the Closing Date (the "CLOSING DATE"), initially specified in Schedule A hereto, which Closing Date shall not be extended by more than seven days without the prior consent of the Company. If the Company defaults on its obligation to deliver Securities to the Depositor, whose offer has been solicited by a Placement Agent on an agency basis and accepted by the Company, or fails to satisfy any condition to its issuance and sale of the Securities hereunder, the Company shall hold such Placement Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from, or as a result of, such default or failure. (b) The Company hereby agrees to pay to each Placement Agent a commission equal to 0.3% of the principal amount of each 3
Security to be delivered to the Depositor to the extent that its offer has been solicited by such Placement Agent on an agency basis during the Agency Period and has been accepted by the Company, or is required to be accepted in accordance with the terms hereof by the Company. Such commission shall be payable, at the option of the applicable Placement Agent, either in the form of a discount from the price received from purchasers of Securities or directly from the Company. Delivery of Securities sold through a Placement Agent as an agent of the Company shall be made by the Company to such Placement Agent for the account of the purchaser thereof only against payment therefor in immediately available funds. In the event that the Depositor fails to accept delivery of such Securities or fails to make payment in full therefor on the Closing Date, the applicable Placement Agent shall promptly notify the Company and return such Securities to the Company, and (notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein) the Placement Agents shall not be entitled to any commission in respect of the Company's acceptance of the offer by the Depositor to purchase such Securities. If such Placement Agent has theretofore paid the Company for such Securities, the Company shall promptly return the related funds to such Placement Agent and shall reimburse such Placement Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of funds for the period such funds were credited to the Company's account. (c) The Company acknowledges that the placement of Securities arranged by the Placement Agents for the Company on an agency basis is being conducted by the Placement Agents in reliance upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein. 2.

such counsel need not express any belief) the Prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (g) the Placement Agents shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Jay D. Browning, Esq., Corporate Secretary and Managing Attorney, Corporate Law for the Company, to the effect that: (i) the Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) each subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) all of the issued shares of capital stock of each subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims; (iv) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities will not contravene any agreement, indenture or instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is known to such counsel and material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency that has not already been obtained is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations 15

In addition, such counsel shall state that no facts have come to such counsel's attention to lead such counsel to believe that (A) the Registration Statement and Prospectus (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein and the Forms T-1 as to which such counsel need not comment) do not comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder or (B)(i) (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein and the Forms T-1 as to which such counsel need not express any belief) the Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein at the time the Registration Statement became effective or at the time of the execution of this Agreement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein and the Forms T-1 as to which such counsel need not express any belief) the Prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The opinions of Baker Botts L.L.P. and Jay D. Browning, Esq. referred to in paragraphs 4(f) and 4(g) above shall be rendered to the Placement Agents at the request of the Company and shall so state therein. (h) on the date hereof and on the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to you letters with respect to the financial statements of the Company, dated such dates, in form and substance satisfactory to you, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; 17
(i) you shall have received on and as of the Closing Date an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Placement Agents, in form and substance satisfactory to you; and (j) you shall have received such other certificates and documents as may be agreed between you and the Company on or prior to the Closing Date. 5. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Placement Agent, each affiliate of any Placement Agent which assists such Placement Agent in the placement of the Securities and each person, if any, who controls any Placement Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including without limitation the legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Placement Agent furnished to the Company in writing by such Placement Agent expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Placement Agent who solicited the offer to purchase Certificates from the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or any person controlling such Placement Agent, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Placement Agent to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Certificates to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 3(b) hereof. Each Placement Agent agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Placement Agent, but only with reference to information relating to such Placement Agent furnished to the Company in writing by such Placement Agent expressly for use in the 18
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PERSON") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Placement Agents, each affiliate of any Placement Agent which assists such Placement Agent in the placement of the Securities and such control persons of Placement Agents shall be designated in writing by Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and such control persons of the Company or authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have 19
reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 5 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total commissions received by the Placement Agents bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Placement Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Placement Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Placement Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the 20
provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Placement Agent be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities placed by it were offered to the Depositor exceeds the amount of any damages that such Placement Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Placement Agents' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule B to this Agreement, and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 5 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Placement Agent or any person controlling any Placement Agent or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities. 6. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Placement Agents, by notice given to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Placement Agents, is material and adverse and which, in the judgment of the Placement Agents, makes it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 7. If this Agreement shall be terminated during the Agency Period by the Placement Agents, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any condition of the Placement Agents' 21
obligations cannot be fulfilled, the Company agrees to reimburse the Placement Agents or such Placement Agents as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Placement Agents in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Securities. 8. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, each affiliate of any Placement Agent which assists such Placement Agent in the placement of the Securities, the Placement Agents, any controlling persons referred to herein and their respective successors and assigns. No purchaser of Securities from the Company through any Placement Agent shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained; provided, however, that the Company covenants and agrees that the Depositor and the Certificates Trustee (on behalf of holders and beneficial owners of Certificates) are third party beneficiaries of the Company's obligation under Section 1(a) to accept in whole each offer from the Depositor to purchase Securities at a price at least equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof. 9. Any action by the Placement Agents hereunder may be taken by Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. jointly or by Banc of America Securities LLC alone on behalf of the Placement Agents, and any such action taken by Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. jointly or by Banc of America Securities LLC alone shall be binding upon the Placement Agents. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Placement Agents shall be given to Banc of America Securities LLC, Bank of America Corporate Center, 100 North Tryon Street, 8th Floor, Charlotte, North Carolina 28255 (telex: (704) 388-9939), Attention: Transaction Management, and J.P.

SCHEDULE B 27

EXHIBIT 4.1 VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION 6.311% Notes due 2007 A series of Securities is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture dated as of December 12, 1997 (the "Indenture"), between Valero Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (in such capacity, the "Trustee"), as follows (capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture, and all references herein to a Section shall refer to the corresponding Section in the Indenture): 1. The title of the 6.311% Notes due 2007 shall be "6.311% Notes due 2007" (the "Notes"). 2. The limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1207) is $50,000,000. 3. The Notes shall be initially issued as Registered Securities in the form of one or more global securities under the Indenture. The Depository Trust Company is hereby designated as the Depository for these global Securities under the Indenture. As long as any Note is in global form, then, notwithstanding clause (11) of Section 301 and the provisions of Section 302, any such global Note shall represent such of the outstanding Notes as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect exchanges or redemptions. Any endorsement of a global Note to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of outstanding Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified in such Note or in a Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303. Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if applicable Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Note in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified in such Note or in the applicable Company Order. With respect to the Notes of any series that are represented by a global Note, the Company authorizes the execution and delivery by the Trustee of a letter of representations or other similar agreement or instrument in the form customarily provided for by the Depository appointed with respect to such global Note. Any global Note may be deposited with the Depository or its nominee, or may remain in the custody of the Trustee pursuant to a FAST Balance Certificate Agreement or similar agreement between the Trustee and the Depository. If a Company Order has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Note in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel. Members of, or participants in, the Depository ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under the Indenture with respect to any global Note held on their behalf by the Depository, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under such global Note and the Depository may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the registered holder of a global Note may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through an Agent Member, to take any action that a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Notes and (ii) nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or shall impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a beneficial owner of any Note. Notwithstanding Section 305, and except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 301, transfers of a global Note shall be limited to transfers of such global Note in whole but not in part, to the Depository, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in a global Note may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depository. In all other respects, Notes shall be transferred to all A-1
beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interest in a Global Security solely as expressly provided in Section 305. In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interest in a global Note to beneficial owners pursuant hereto and Section 305, the Security Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the global Note of the applicable series in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the global Note to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Notes shall authenticate and deliver, one or more Notes of like tenor and amount. In connection with the transfer of an entire global Note to beneficial owners pursuant hereto and Section 305, the global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depository in exchange for its beneficial interest in the global Note, an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of the applicable series of authorized denominations. Neither the Company nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, Notes by the Depository, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depository relating to such Notes. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay by the related global Note Holder or the Depository in identifying the beneficial owners, and each such Person may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, instructions from such global Note Holder or the Depository for all purposes (including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Notes to be issued). Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 201 and 307, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any global Note shall be made to the Person or Persons specified in such global Note. 4. The dates on which the principal of the Notes is payable shall be November 30, 2007. 5. The rate at which the Notes shall bear interest shall be 6.311% per annum. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The date from which interest shall accrue for the Notes shall be November 20, 2002. The Interest Payment Dates on which interest on the Notes shall be payable are May 30 and November 30, commencing May 30, 2003. Interest on the Notes shall be payable to the persons in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment, except in the case of default interest, which will be payable as provided in the Indenture. The Regular Record Date for the interest payable on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date shall be the May 15 and November 15, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. No Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to the Notes. 6. The place or places where the principal of, premium (if any) on and interest on the Notes shall be payable is at the office or agency of the Trustee in New York, New York or such other offices or agencies maintained for such purpose as the Company may from time to time and in accordance with the Indenture designate. If appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received by the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office or at its corporate trust facility in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, not later than 5 Business Days prior to the record date for an applicable Interest Payment Date, then payments in respect of the Notes evidenced by a global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder of such global Note. In all other cases, payment of interest on the Notes may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. 7. Each series of Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate A-2
(as defined below) plus 35 basis points, as calculated by an Independent Investment Banker plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption.

If any Event of Default at any time outstanding occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may declare the principal amount of all Securities to be due and payable immediately. At any time after a declaration or occurrence of acceleration with respect to the Securities has been made, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration has been obtained, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul the acceleration. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to the Securities. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest) if in good faith it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company must furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee. 10. Discharge Prior to Maturity. The Indenture with respect to the Securities shall be discharged and canceled upon the payment of all Securities and, as provided in the Indenture, shall be discharged except for certain obligations upon the irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of funds sufficient for such payment. 11. Trustee Dealings with Company. The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not Trustee. 12. Authentication. This Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized signer of the Trustee. 13. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed thereon. 14. Abbreviations.
