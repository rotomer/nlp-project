If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "SECURITIES ACT"), a registration statement (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on Form S-3, relating to certain debt securities (the "SHELF SECURITIES") to be issued from time to time by the Company. The Company also has filed with, or proposes to file with, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities. The registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement is hereinafter referred to as the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT" and the related prospectus covering the Shelf Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "BASIC PROSPECTUS". The Basic Prospectus as supplemented by the pro-
spectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "PROSPECTUS". If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "RULE 462 REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary form of prospectus (a "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS") previously filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "EXCHANGE ACT") on or before the date of this Agreement or the date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. The Company hereby agrees with the Underwriters as follows: 1. The Company agrees to issue and sell the Securities to the several Underwriters as hereinafter provided, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, agrees to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company the respective principal amount of Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto plus accrued interest, if any, from the date specified in Schedule I hereto to the date of payment and delivery. 2.

Business Day (as defined below) thereafter, as you and the Company may agree in writing). As used herein, the term "BUSINESS DAY" means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City. The time and date of such payment and delivery with respect to the Securities are referred to herein as the "CLOSING DATE". Payment for the Securities shall be made against delivery to the nominee of The Depository Trust Company for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Securities of one or more global notes (the "GLOBAL NOTE") representing the Securities, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the transfer to the Underwriters of the Securities duly paid by the Company.

aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (vii) the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (except for the financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of the dates they were filed with the Commission or to the extent such documents were subsequently amended prior to the date hereof, at the time so amended, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. In addition, such counsel shall state that no facts have come to such counsel's attention to lead such counsel to believe that (A) the Registration Statement and Prospectus (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein and the Forms T-1 as to which such counsel need not comment) do not comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder or (B)(i) (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein and the Forms T-1 as to which such counsel need not express any belief) the Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein at the time the Registration Statement became effective or at the time of the execution of this Agreement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein and the Forms T-1 as to which such counsel need not express any belief) the Prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The opinions of Baker Botts L.L.P. and Jay D. Browning, Esq. referred to in paragraphs 6(f) and 6(g) above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein. (h) on the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to you a letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to you, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial 16
statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; and (i) you shall have received on and as of the Closing Date an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to you. 7. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each affiliate of any Underwriter which assists such Underwriter in the distribution of the Securities and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including without limitation the legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 5(b) hereof. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration 17
Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PERSON") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters, each affiliate of any Underwriter which assists such Underwriter in the distribution of the Securities and such control persons of Underwriters shall be designated in writing by the first of the named Representatives on Schedule I hereto and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and such control persons of the Company or authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the 18
Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and the commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action 19
or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto, and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities. 8. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and which, in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 9. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase under this 20
Agreement, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-tenth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. 10. (a) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any condition of the Underwriters' obligations cannot be fulfilled, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Securities. (b) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any condition of the Underwriters' obligations cannot be fulfilled, the Company agrees that it will purchase from 21
UBS Warburg LLC (or such affiliate as UBS Warburg LLC may designate) $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.75% Notes due December 15, 2032 (the "Old Securities") for $178,200,529 and will pay such amount immediately by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by UBS Warburg LLC, and UBS Warburg agrees to sell (or cause its affiliate) to sell such Old Securities to the Company; provided that if UBS AG has not yet purchased the Old Securities at the time the Agreement is terminated, UBS Warburg LLC may elect instead to cause UBS AG to assign all of its rights and obligations to purchase the Old Securities to the Company, and the Company agrees that upon such an assignment it will assume all of the rights and obligations of UBS AG to purchase the Old Securities and will immediately pay to UBS Warburg LLC $28,200,529 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by UBS Warburg LLC. Upon any such termination and satisfaction of the Company's obligations under this Section 10(b), all agreements entered into in connection with the Old Securities shall terminate. 11. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, each affiliate of any Underwriter which assists such Underwriter in the distribution of the Securities, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase. 12. Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by you jointly or by the first of the named Representatives set forth in Schedule I hereto alone on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by you jointly or by the first of the named Representatives set forth in Schedule I hereto alone shall be binding upon the Underwriters. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be given at the address set forth in Schedule I hereto. Notices to the Company shall be given to it at Valero Energy Corporation, One Valero Place, San Antonio, Texas 78212 (facsimile: (210) 370-2490); Attention: Corporate Secretary. 13. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 22
14. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. 23

SCHEDULE II

Exhibit 4.1 VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION 6.700% Notes due 2013 A series of Securities is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture dated as of December 12, 1997 (the "Indenture"), between Valero Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (in such capacity, the "Trustee"), as follows (capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture, and all references herein to a Section shall refer to the corresponding Section in the Indenture): 1. The title of the 6.700% Notes due 2013 shall be "6.700% Notes due 2013" (the "Notes"). 2. The initial limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1207) is $180,000,000. 3. The Notes shall be initially issued as Registered Securities in the form of one or more global securities under the Indenture. The Depository Trust Company is hereby designated as the Depository for these global Securities under the Indenture. As long as any Note is in global form, then, notwithstanding clause (11) of Section 301 and the provisions of Section 302, any such global Note shall represent such of the outstanding Notes as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect exchanges or redemptions. Any endorsement of a global Note to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of outstanding Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified in such Note or in a Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303. Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if applicable Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Note in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified in such Note or in the applicable Company Order. With respect to the Notes of any series that are represented by a global Note, the Company authorizes the execution and delivery by the Trustee of a letter of representations or other similar agreement or instrument in the form customarily provided for by the Depository appointed with respect to such global Note. Any global Note may be deposited with the Depository or its nominee, or may remain in the custody of the Trustee pursuant to a FAST Balance Certificate Agreement or similar agreement between the Trustee and the Depository. If a Company Order has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Note in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel. Members of, or participants in, the Depository ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under the Indenture with respect to any global Note held on their behalf by the Depository, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under such global Note and the Depository may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the registered holder of a global Note may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through an Agent Member, to take any action that a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Notes and (ii) nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or shall impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a beneficial owner of any Note. Notwithstanding Section 305, and except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 301, transfers of a global Note shall be limited to transfers of such global Note in whole but not in part, to the Depository, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in a global Note may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depository. In all other respects, Notes shall be transferred to all A-1
beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interest in a Global Security solely as expressly provided in Section 305. In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interest in a global Note to beneficial owners pursuant hereto and Section 305, the Security Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the global Note of the applicable series in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the global Note to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Notes shall authenticate and deliver, one or more Notes of like tenor and amount. In connection with the transfer of an entire global Note to beneficial owners pursuant hereto and Section 305, the global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depository in exchange for its beneficial interest in the global Note, an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of the applicable series of authorized denominations. Neither the Company nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, Notes by the Depository, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depository relating to such Notes. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay by the related global Note Holder or the Depository in identifying the beneficial owners, and each such Person may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, instructions from such global Note Holder or the Depository for all purposes (including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Notes to be issued). Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 201 and 307, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any global Note shall be made to the Person or Persons specified in such global Note. 4. The dates on which the principal of the Notes is payable shall be January 15, 2013. 5. The rate at which the Notes shall bear interest shall be 6.700% per annum. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The date from which interest shall accrue for the Notes shall be December 16, 2002. The Interest Payment Dates on which interest on the Notes shall be payable are January 15 and July 15, commencing July 15, 2003. Interest on the Notes shall be payable to the persons in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment, except in the case of default interest, which will be payable as provided in the Indenture. The Regular Record Date for the interest payable on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date shall be the December 31 and June 30, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. No Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to the Notes. 6. The place or places where the principal of, premium (if any) on and interest on the Notes shall be payable is at the office or agency of the Trustee in New York, New York or such other offices or agencies maintained for such purpose as the Company may from time to time and in accordance with the Indenture designate. If appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received by the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office or at its corporate trust facility in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, not later than 5 Business Days prior to the record date for an applicable Interest Payment Date, then payments in respect of the Notes evidenced by a global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder of such global Note. In all other cases, payment of interest on the Notes may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. 7. Each series of Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate A-2
(as defined below) plus 35 basis points, as calculated by an Independent Investment Banker plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption.

Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from December 16, 2002; provided that if there is no existing Default in the payment of, or provisions for, interest, and if this Security is authenticated between a Regular Record Date referred to on the face hereof (whether or not a Business Day) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; provided, further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be July 15, 2003.

Any such interest which is so payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date, shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid as more fully provided in the Indenture.

Without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may supplement the Indenture or the Securities (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, in each case which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Indenture and which shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holders of the Securities in any material respect; (ii) to evidence the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and this Security; (iii) to change or eliminate any restrictions on the payment of principal (or premium, if any) on Registered Securities, to permit Registered Securities to be exchanged for Bearer Securities or to permit the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form, provided any such action shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holders of the Securities in any material respect; (iv) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities or Holders of other series of Debt Securities, or to surrender any right or power conferred by the Indenture upon the Company; (v) to add to, delete from or revise the conditions, limitations and restrictions on the authorized amount, terms or purpose of issue, authentication and delivery of the Securities as set forth in the Indenture; or (vi) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts thereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of the Indenture.

AA-5
A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of the Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Debt Securities under the Indenture, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under the Indenture of the Holders of Debt Securities of any other series. 9. Defaults and Remedies. Events of Default are defined in the Indenture and generally include: (i) failure to pay principal of or any premium on any Security when due and payable; (ii) failure to pay any interest on any Security when due and payable, and the continuation of the default for 30 days; (iii) failure to perform any other covenant, or breach of any warranty, of the Company in the Indenture, continued for 60 days after written notice is given or received as provided in the Indenture; (iv) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization; and (v) failure to pay at final maturity (after the expiration of any applicable grace periods) or upon the declaration of acceleration of payment of indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any Subsidiary in excess of $25 million, if such indebtedness is not discharged, or such acceleration is not annulled, within 10 days after written notice. If any Event of Default at any time outstanding occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may declare the principal amount of all Securities to be due and payable immediately. At any time after a declaration or occurrence of acceleration with respect to the Securities has been made, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration has been obtained, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul the acceleration. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to the Securities. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest) if in good faith it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company must furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee. 10. Discharge Prior to Maturity. The Indenture with respect to the Securities shall be discharged and canceled upon the payment of all Securities and, as provided in the Indenture, shall be discharged except for certain obligations upon the irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of funds sufficient for such payment. 11. Trustee Dealings with Company. The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not Trustee. 12. Authentication. This Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized signer of the Trustee. 13. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed thereon. 14. Abbreviations.
