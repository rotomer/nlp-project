Covenants of the Company. In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters and Orion herein contained, the Company covenants with each Underwriter and Orion as follows: (a) To furnish to you, without charge, two conformed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits and documents incorporated by reference thereto) and for delivery to each other Underwriter a conformed copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and to furnish to you in New York City, without charge, prior to 10:00

(b) During the period after the first date of the public offering of the Shares as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, before amending or supplementing the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (including by filing any document that would as a result thereof be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) to furnish to you a copy of each such proposed amendment, supplement or other document and not to file any such proposed amendment, supplement or other document to which you reasonably object, and to file with the Commission within the applicable period specified in Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act any prospectus required to be filed pursuant to such Rule.

(d) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Shares as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Shares may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus, so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law. (e) To endeavor to qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall
reasonably request and to maintain such qualifications for as long as the Underwriters shall reasonably request. (f) To make generally available to the Company's security holders and to you as soon as practicable an earnings statement covering the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2004 that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. (g) To comply with all rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange in respect of the listing of the Common Shares and to use its best efforts to cause the Common Shares to be eligible for trading thereon. 7. Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company agrees to pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and the Company's accountants in connection with the registration and delivery of the Shares under the Securities Act and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers, in the quantities herein above specified, (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares under state securities laws and all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Shares for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 6(e) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum, (iii) all filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection with any required review and qualification of the offering of the Shares by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (iv) all fees and expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the registration statement on Form 8-A relating to the Common Stock and all costs and expenses incident to listing the Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (v) the cost of printing certificates representing the Shares, (vi) the costs and charges of any transfer agent, registrar or depositary, (vii) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any one "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Shares, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the Company, travel and lodging expenses of the officers of the Company and any such consultants, and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of
the Company hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section, provided that the Underwriters agree to pay all of the costs and expenses relating to any "road show" relating directly to the Underwriters, including the cost of chartering any aircraft. It is understood that (i) except as provided in this Section, Section 8 entitled "Indemnity and Contribution", and the last paragraph of Section 10 below, the Underwriters and Orion will pay all of their respective costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their respective counsel, stock transfer taxes payable on resale of any of the Shares by the Underwriters and any advertising expenses connected with any offers the Underwriters may make, and (ii) Orion will pay all costs and expenses related to the transfer and delivery of the Shares to the Underwriters, including any transfer or other taxes payable thereon. 8. Indemnity and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, Orion, the directors of Orion, the officers of Orion and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or Orion within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to Orion furnished to the Company in writing by Orion directly or through counsel expressly for use therein or relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you or through your counsel expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Shares, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 6(a) hereof. (b) Orion agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement, each Underwriter and each person, if any, who
controls the Company or any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to Orion furnished to the Company in writing by Orion directly or through counsel expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. (c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement, Orion and each person, if any, who controls the Company or Orion within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you or through your counsel expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. (d) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c), such person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may
designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section, and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Orion and all persons, if any, who control Orion within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons of any Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for Orion and such control persons of Orion, such firm shall be designated in writing by Orion. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent
of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (e) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such subsection, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(e)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and Orion on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by Orion and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Company and Orion from allocating any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities between themselves pursuant to a separate agreement between such parties. The relative fault of the Company and Orion on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or Orion on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(f) The Company, Orion and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and (ii) Orion shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the proceeds received by Orion from the Underwriters in the offering. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. (g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any termination of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or the Company or Orion, their officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or Orion and acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares. 9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by you to the Company and Orion, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your
judgment, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 9(a)(i) through 9(a)(iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 10. Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to you, the Company and Orion for the purchase of such Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or Orion. In any such case you, the Company or Orion shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or Orion to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company or Orion shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the non-complying party will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder. 11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. 12. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York. 13. Headings. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement. 14. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the

EXHIBIT A October __, 2003 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, NY Lehman Brothers Inc. 745 Seventh Avenue New York, New York 10025 Re: Orion Refining Corporation 8,460,000 Shares of Preferred Stock Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel for Orion Refining Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Selling Stockholder") and a stockholder of Valero Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase by you (the "Underwriters") from the Selling Stockholder pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated October __, 2003 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Stockholder, of an aggregate of 8,460,000 shares of the Company's 2% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, liquidation preference $25 per share (the "Preferred Shares"). In that connection, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion, including: (a) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-106949)(the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 11, 2003 and Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the Commission on August 18, 2003, Amendment No. 2 thereto filed with the Commission on September 18, 2003 and Amendment No. 3 thereto filed with the Commission on October 14, 2003 with respect to the registration of the sale of up to 8,460,000 Preferred Shares under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"); (b) the final prospectus dated October __, 2003, as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the "Base Prospectus"); (c) the final Prospectus Supplement dated October __, 2003 to the Base Prospectus (the "Prospectus Supplement" and together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"); (d) the Underwriting Agreement; and (e) certificates representing the Preferred Shares. As to questions of fact material to this opinion and not independently established by us, we have relied, to the extent we have deemed appropriate, upon certificates of officers or representatives of the Company or the Selling Stockholder. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used with the same meanings ascribed to them in the Underwriting Agreement. Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that no consent, approval, authorization or filing with any Texas or Federal governmental authority is required to be obtained or made by the Selling Stockholder in connection with the execution and delivery by the Selling Stockholder of the Underwriting Agreement or the consummation of the sale of the Preferred Stock to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, except for any consents, approvals, authorizations or filings required pursuant to state securities or blue sky laws or pursuant to state or Federal bankruptcy laws (as to which we express no opinion) and those consents, approvals, authorizations or filings already obtained or made. The foregoing relates only to requirements of Texas and Federal law that are of general application and that, in our experience, are likely to have application to transactions of the nature herein referenced (and not to requirements of any law that might be implicated by reason of the specific business activities of any of the above referenced entities). We express no opinion herein as to any matters governed by any law other than the laws of the State of Texas and the Federal law of the United States of America. We are furnishing this opinion to you solely for your benefit. This opinion may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. 2

Certificate (the "Director Certificates"); that certain Security Agreement made by Orion and certain other parties party thereto in favor of General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC"), as Administrative Agent, dated as of February 28, 2002 (the "Security Agreement"), granting GECC an irrevocable proxy with full power of substitution (the "Original Proxy") to exercise voting rights with respect to all shares of stock of Orion (the "Shares") held by Special Situations Holdings X LLC-Orion ("CSFB"); a letter from GECC to CSFB dated October ___, 2003 attached hereto granting CSFB voting rights with respect to the Shares (the "CSFB Proxy"); a letter from CSFB to E. Baines Manning dated October ___, 2003 attached hereto granting Mr. Manning voting rights with respect to the Shares (the "Manning Proxy" and, together with the Original Proxy and the CSFB Proxy, the "Proxies"); and a written consent dated October ___, 2003 executed by Mr. Manning and delivered to the Secretary of Orion at the principal place of business thereof (the "Consent"). In such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies or drafts of documents to be executed and the legal capacity of natural persons to complete the execution of documents. We have further assumed for purposes of this opinion: (i) the due formation or organization, valid existence and good standing of each entity that is a party to the documents examined by us under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation or organization; (ii) except to the extent addressed by our opinion set forth in paragraph 1, below, the due adoption, authorization, execution and delivery by, or on behalf of, each of the parties thereto of the above-referenced documents by each of the signatories thereto; (iii) that the Underwriting Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of each of the parties thereto and is enforceable against each of the parties thereto in accordance with its terms; and (iv) that the documents examined by us express the entire understanding of the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and have not been supplemented, amended or otherwise modified. We have also assumed that the Proxies are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms and that Mr. Manning is duly authorized pursuant thereto to execute and deliver the Consent. No opinion is expressed with respect to the requirements of, or compliance with, federal or state securities or blue sky laws. We have not reviewed any documents other than those identified above in connection with this opinion and we have assumed that there are no documents that are contrary to or inconsistent with the opinions expressed herein. Further, we express no opinion with respect to any offering materials relating to the Preferred Shares and assume no responsibility for their contents. As to any fact material to our opinion, other than those assumed, we have relied without independent investigation on the above-referenced documents and on the accuracy, as of the date hereof, of the matters therein contained. To the extent our opinion set forth in paragraph 3 below relates to the requirement for any consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any Delaware governmental authority, our opinion relates only to requirements of Delaware law that are of general application and that, in 4
our experience, are likely to have application to transactions of the nature herein referenced (and not to requirements of law that might be implicated by reason of the specific business activities of any of the above-referenced entities). For purposes of our opinion set forth in paragraph 4 below, we have relied exclusively on a review of the docket of the Bankruptcy Court on October ___, 2003. Based on and subject to the foregoing, and limited in all respects to matters of Delaware law and federal bankruptcy law, it is our opinion that: 1. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered on behalf of Orion. 2. Orion has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement and to sell, assign, transfer and deliver the Preferred Shares to be sold by Orion pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. 3. No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with the Bankruptcy Court or any other Delaware governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by Orion of the Underwriting Agreement and the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Preferred Shares to be sold by Orion pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. 4. The Sale Order has been entered, is in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and has not been amended, stayed, vacated or rescinded. Pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Sale Order, upon consummation of the sale of the Preferred Shares pursuant to the procedures established by the Sale Order and Orion's receipt of the purchase price for the Preferred Shares, the Preferred Shares shall be free and clear of all liens, claims, interests and encumbrances of any kind and nature. This opinion speaks only as of the date hereof and is based on our understandings and assumptions as to the present facts and our review of the above-referenced documents and the application of Delaware law and federal bankruptcy law as the same exist on the date hereof, and we undertake no duty to update or supplement this opinion for the benefit of any person or entity with respect to any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in facts or law that may hereafter occur or take effect. This opinion is intended solely for the benefit of the addresses hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and may not be relied upon by any other person or entity or for any other purpose without our prior written consent. Very truly yours, MORRIS, NICHOLS, ARSHT AND TUNNEL Jonathan I. Lessner 5
