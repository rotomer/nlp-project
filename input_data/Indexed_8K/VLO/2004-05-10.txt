FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED
 
To the Owners of the El Paso Aruba Refining Business:
In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheets and the related combined statements of income and owner's net investment, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the El Paso Aruba Refining Business of El Paso Merchant Energy Petroleum Company (collectively, the "Business") at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their combined operations and their combined cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Business's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the combined financial statements, in 2002 the Business adopted EITF Issue No. 02-3, .

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect to the Aruba acquisition as described in Valero's Form 8-K filed on March 9, 2004. Certain historical balance sheet and income statement amounts of Aruba have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation of Valero. Valero's historical income statement for the year ended December 31, 2003 has been adjusted on a pro forma basis to reflect the Orion acquisition and related financing, which were completed on July 1, 2003, as if they had occurred on January 1, 2003. For additional information on this transaction, see Valero's Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on September 18, 2003 and Valero's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 is presented as if the Aruba acquisition had occurred on that date. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003 assumes that the Aruba acquisition occurred on January 1, 2003. The purchase price for the Aruba acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, pending the completion of an independent appraisal and other evaluations. The purchase price related to working capital which is reflected in the pro forma combined balance sheet is based on Aruba working capital amounts, excluding affiliate balances, as of December 31, 2003.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with (i) the historical consolidated financial statements of Valero included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and (ii) the historical combined financial statements of the El Paso Aruba Refining Business included in this Form 8-K/A. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the financial position that would have been obtained or the financial results that would have occurred if the Aruba acquisition had been consummated on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the financial position or financial results in the future. The pro forma adjustments, as described in the Notes to Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, are based upon available information and certain assumptions that Valero's management believes are reasonable.
